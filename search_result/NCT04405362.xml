    <time_frame>at inclusion, then at 1 month and 3 months after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>This self-questionnaire is intended to measure subjective post-traumatic stress after a traumatic situation (within 7 days) but is not a diagnostic tool. It includes 22 items rated from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). There are 3 sub-scales:
an avoidance subscale (items 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 17, 22): the sum of the scores on each of these items ranges from 0 to 35;
Memory intrusion subscale (items 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 14, 16 and 20): the sum of the scores on each of these items ranges from 0 to 40;
a Hyperarousal/High Neurovegetative Activation subscale (items 4, 10, 15, 18, 19 and 21): the sum of the scores on each of these items ranges from 0 to 35.
A total score of at least 22 suggests the presence of significant symptoms of acute stress. A score of 36 and above suggests the presence of post-traumatic stress disorder.</description>
