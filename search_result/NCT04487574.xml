    <textblock>
      The innovative drug XC221 100 mg tablet is designed for the treatment of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2
      infection). A multicenter, adaptive, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III
      clinical study is aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of XC221 100 mg tablet, in COVID-19
      patients during a 14-day treatment.

      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the efficacy of XC221 100 mg tablet (200
      mg daily dose) in achieving clinical improvement of COVID-19 symptoms.

      The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of XC221 100 mg tablet (200 mg
      daily dose) in COVID-19 patients.

    <textblock>
      11 Russian centers will participate in this study. The trail will consist of three periods:
      screening (duration not more than 1 day, it may coincide with the randomization visit and
      beginning of drug administration), treatment period (14 days) and follow-up period (14 ± 1
      days after completion of treatment with XC221 / Placebo). The duration of participation in
      the study for each patient will be no more than 30 days.

      118 eligible patients with confirmed COVID-19 will be randomized into two groups (Group A and
      Group B) in a 1:1 ratio: Group A - XC221 200 mg daily (59 patients); Group В - Placebo (59
      patients).

      During the treatment period (14 days), 1 tablet of XC221 / Placebo will be administered 2
      times a day in addition to the standard of care (SoC) for COVID-19 according to The Temporary
      guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection of the
      Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation (the MoH Temporary Guidelines). The follow-up
      period will last for 14 days.
