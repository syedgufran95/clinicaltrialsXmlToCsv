  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 3 million people worldwide across more
      than 200 countries.

      In the United Kingdom alone, at the end of April, there were almost 160,000 confirmed cases
      with more than 20,000 deaths. This has undoubtedly had significant physical and economical
      impact on the public.

      Healthcare workers are at high risk of developing life-threatening infectious diseases with
      increased exposure to patients' blood and bodily fluids. As such, health care workers
      arguably experience heightened anxiety and are predisposed to greater negative psycho-social
      impact from the current COVID-19 pandemic.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the physical and psychological impact of COVID-19 on
      healthcare workers. This will be performed in two phases.

      In phase 1, investigators will collect information to evaluate the current psychiatric
      symptom profile (in particular, screening for anxiety or depression related symptoms),
      alcohol use, sleep-related complaints and overall well-being among healthcare workers who
      participate in this survey (with a focus on junior doctors). In addition the association of
      these mental health and behavioural parameters with the prevalence of stressful occasions,
      such as long-hours, unpredictability of work / redeployment, availability of personal
      protection equipment and concerns regarding family/relationship and self will be assessed.

      In phase 2, investigators will then reassess for the development or progression of
      psychiatric symptoms, use of alcohol and other substances, behavioural or interpersonal
      relationship changes as well as physical well-being at 6 weeks and 4- months. Physical
      well-being is assessed through the presence of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection and
      absence from work. Specifically, investigators will study the impact of variable provision of
      personal protection equipment (supply and training), extended working hours, and concern for
      well-being of family members, on work morale and anxiety levels.

      Another aim is also study the longer term mental health consequences of the current pandemic
      on health care workers.
