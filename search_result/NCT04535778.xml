  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-centre, interventional randomised controlled trial.

      Participants will be individually randomised to receive either COMPASS online CBT + &quot;usual
      care&quot; (standard LTC charity support), or usual care only. Randomisation will be stratified by
      recruiting charity site to ensure a balance of participants with different LTCs across the
      intervention and control arm. Randomisation will occur using a 1:1 allocation ratio managed
      by RECAP software.

      Participants randomised to COMPASS will receive access to the online program. It consists of
      11 online modules which target challenges associated with living with LTC(s) and includes,
      amongst other things, psycho-education, patient examples, interactive tasks and goal setting.
      Participants are linked to a therapist; 'guide', who will provide 6 x 30 minute support
      sessions delivered fortnightly in the format preferred by the client (phone and/or in-site
      message).

      Participants allocated to the usual care control arm will receive the usual care that is
      available to them via their charity. All charities include a helpline which can be accessed
      via telephone or email. The helplines at all charities offer one-off emotional and/or
      informational support provided by people trained in active listening and/or counselling
      skills. Additional support avenues that can be accessed may include online support groups,
      local community support groups and informational resources.
