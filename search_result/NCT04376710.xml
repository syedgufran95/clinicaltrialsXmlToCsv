  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current COVID-19 pandemic has caused delays in initial or follow-up encounters between
      surgical patients and physicians. While this delay allows for resource allocation to those
      most severely affected by the pandemic, surgeons are faced with potential important delays in
      diagnosis and the expanding backlog of elective cases and initial evaluations.

      This project will assess surgeon and patient telemedicine perspectives. Pre-pandemic views on
      telemedicine among a cohort of surgeons will be obtained and compared to views at 3 months
      from the peak of the pandemic. Patients will be surveyed following telemedicine appointments
      with an anonymous questionnaire to learn about patient receptiveness to telemedicine.
      Barriers to implementation will be addressed throughout the duration of the study.

        Surgical faculty at participating institutions will be able to complete pre and post
        pandemic surveys regarding telemedicine and barriers to implementation.

        Surgical patients who complete a telemedicine encounter from the start of the study through
        a 6-month period will be included in the study. They will be able to complete an optional
        anonymous survey regarding perceptions to telemedicine and perceived barriers to
        implementation.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Surgical faculty at participating institutions will receive surveys regarding
             telemedicine early in the start of the study to assess baseline perceptions. These
             same group of surgeons will receive subsequent surveys 3 months after the peak of the
             pandemic to evaluate telemedicine perceptions following a rapid implementation and
             adoption of telemedicine.

          2. Surgical patients evaluated from the start of the study through a 6-month period will
             be included in the study. They will have the option after each telemedicine encounter
             to complete an anonymous survey regarding perceptions to this technology.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. No exclusions for surgical faculty are identified. Accrual of data from this group
             will be limited only by response rates to administered surveys.

          2. Exclusions for surgical patients will include the inability to access the technology
             required for a telemedicine consultation (e.g.: absence of a camera enabled
             smartphone, absence of a required internet or cellular connection to perform a
             telemedicine encounter). The investigators will keep a list of reasons for the
             inability to perform a telemedicine encounter to identify the barriers to
             implementation among patients.
