  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational cohort study of healthcare workers working in high-risk
      COVID-19 clinical areas, monitoring heart rate, sleep and temperature, correlating with daily
      self-reported symptoms, oxygen saturations and PCR Swabs. It will provide information about
      how many healthcare workers develop COVID-19, what their clinical observations and symptoms
      are.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the COVID-19 Pandemic, doctors and other healthcare workers who work in COVID+ wards,
      intensive care unit and the accident and emergency department are at high risk of developing
      COVID-19 infection.

      In April 2020, 14.6% of doctors were off sick with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.
      Meanwhile, 17.9% of COVID+ patients are thought to be asymptomatic. Therefore, healthcare
      workers are also high-risk of spreading infection to patients, colleagues and their families.

      This is a prospective observational cohort study that leverages wearable medical device
      technology and data analytics to develop an algorithm for early detection of COVID-19
      infection in healthcare workers.

      A total of 60 healthy healthcare workers working within high-risk COVID-19 clinical areas
      will be asked to wear a wearable medical device that measures their heart rate, skin
      temperature and sleep during non-working hours. They will take daily swabs for COVID-19 from
      themselves, measure their oxygen levels daily, and answer a survey of self-reported symptoms
      daily for the 30 day study period.

      These will then be analyzed to develop an algorithm for early detection of COVID-19 in
      healthcare workers, and help to inform future workforce decisions, to promote welfare and
      prevent the spread of COVID-19.
