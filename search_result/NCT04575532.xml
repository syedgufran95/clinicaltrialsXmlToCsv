  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we will be monitoring for patient events (emergency department admission,
      hospital admission, admission to an observation unit, or death) and evaluating the
      feasibility and utility of using pinpointIQ in the management of patients with COVID-19.
      Vital sign (physiology data) is collected to build a Covid Decompensation Index and
      contribute data to a Covid Digital Hub supported by the National Institutes of Health.

      This is a prospective, non-randomized, open-label, two-phase design. The primary focus for
      the study is data collection for index development. This will be done in two phases: the
      first phase allows for determination of predictor variables that establish the COVID-19
      Decompensation Index (CDI) and the second phase establishes performance of the CDI. A
      participant is considered to have completed the study if he or she completes all phases of
      the study including the last day of monitoring (day 28).

        Participants will be adult patients in the University of Illinois Health System (UIH).
        Participants will be recruited from two pools of patients at UIH: 1) patients tested in the
        outpatient setting who have a positive result for SAR-Co-V2 (COVID-19) and 2) patients who
        were admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and subsequently discharged to
        home convalescence. This will be a convenience sample. Phase 1 will have a sample size of
        400 and Phase 2 will have a sample size of 1,200.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Obtained signed and dated informed consent form Patient in the University of Illinois
        Health System Patient agrees to comply with all study procedures and availability for the
        duration of the study Male or female, aged &gt; 18 years of age Patient diagnosed with
        COVID-19 (positive SARS CoV2 test) Patient agrees to refrain from swimming or taking baths
        (any activity that submerges the biosensor in water for any period). Showering is okay.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Known allergic reactions to components of the hydrocolloid gel adhesives Subject has
        cognitive or physical limitations that, in the opinion of the investigator, limits the
        subject's ability to fully follow study procedures Cognitive ability, in the opinion of the
        investigator, that limits the patient's ability to use the biosensor and smartphone
        consistent with study requirements.

    <ipd_description>This effort is part of a hub-and-spoke technology implementation model created by the NIH, in which each supported digital health solution (the spokes) will be required to share deidentified data and other digital assets it generates with an NIH-supported central data hub. The data hub will provide global researchers a single access point to deidentified data, algorithms, and other capabilities generated by the various digital health solutions. Standards that enhance interoperability will enable unambiguous linking of digital resources among the spokes of the hub. This will enable researchers, for example, to apply the CDI developed in this project's spoke to individuals' health data that was collected by other spokes.</ipd_description>
