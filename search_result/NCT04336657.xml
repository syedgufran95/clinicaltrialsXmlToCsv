  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan, China was first reported to the WHO Country
      Office in China on 31 December 2019. The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of
      International Concern on 30 January 2020. The spread and severity of the disease is variable
      from one country to another. Our team as well as many reports suggested that in some
      countries a &quot; Flu like illness but much worse&quot; was described in October, November and early
      in December before the WHO announcement. Was it COVID-19?
