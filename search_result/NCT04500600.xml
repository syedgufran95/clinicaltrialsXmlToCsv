    <textblock>
      This study investigates the well-being and health-related quality of life in cancer patients
      and survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using questionnaires may help researchers gain an
      understanding of how experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., exposure, risk factors,
      testing, isolation, seropositivity, hospitalization, loss of family or friends, loss of
      income), may impact multiple domains of health-related quality of life (physical, emotional
      and social well-being), and other areas such as COVID-19-specific psychological distress
      (e.g., fear, anxiety and depressive symptoms), and disruptions to health care, finances, and
      social interactions.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess experiences during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (e.g.,
      exposure, risk factors, testing, isolation, seropositivity, hospitalization, loss of family
      or friends); COVID-19-specific psychological distress (e.g., fear, anxiety and depressive
      symptoms); health, financial and social disruptions; perceived benefits and social support;
      and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in a convenience sample of cancer patients and
      survivors.

      II. Evaluate the extent to which COVID-19 experiences are associated with COVID-19-specific
      psychological distress, health, financial and social disruptions, perceived benefits and
      social support, and HRQoL.

      III. Evaluate the extent to which resiliency factors such as social support and perceived
      benefits moderate the effects of COVID-19 experiences on COVID-19-specific psychological
      distress and HRQoL.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete an online questionnaire over 10 minutes regarding the COVID-19 pandemic
      including testing, risks of exposure, whether people they know have acquired COVID-19, as
      well as questions on how the pandemic has impacted their quality of life.
