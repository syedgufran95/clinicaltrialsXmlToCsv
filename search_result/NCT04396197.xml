  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study exploring the levels of mobility and rehabilitation in
      patients admitted to critical care with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) often results in significant muscle weakness and
      physical deconditioning, which can take many months or even years for recovery. Early and
      progressive programmes of rehabilitation are recommended to limit any muscle loss and support
      recovery as early as possible. Patients admitted to intensive care with COVID-19 have been
      found to require prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation, high sedation and neuromuscular
      blocking use and as a result require prolonged stays in the ICU. As yet no data exists to
      examine the specific physical impact this may have, or whether it is safe and feasible to
      commence this earlier rehabilitation within the ICU for patients with a diagnosis of
      COVID-19. Our study set out to evaluate the levels of rehabilitation which were delivered in
      a large acute NHS trust.
