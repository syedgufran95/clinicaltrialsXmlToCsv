  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In some patients, lung function declined by about 20 to 30% after recovery. Computer
      tomography of COVID-19 patients revealed a ground glass opacity in both lungs. We will
      measure the Cardiorespiratory fitness according to American College of Sports medicine
      guidline and provide physiotherapy exercise to the patients to measure the improvement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, the first reports emerged of a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome
      (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China. The virus, which causes atypical pneumonia
      progressing to acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in some
      individuals, was named COVID-19. The burden of fibrotic lung disease following SARS-CoV-2
      infection is likely to be high; therefore, given the scale of the pandemic, the global burden
      of fibrotic lung disease will probably increase considerably. The aim of this study is to
      check the cardiorespiratory fitness level and the effect of Physical therapy intervention to
      improve the Cardiorespiratory fitness level in patients recovered from COVID-19. Quality of
      life has also been affected due to COVID19 due to decreased Cardiorespiratory fitness level,
      and this study also aims to improve the quality of life of people recovered from COVID19.

    <measure>SF-36 QUESTIONNAIRE</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 questionnaire consists of 36 items, which are used to calculate eight subscales: physical functioning (PF), role physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role emotional (RE), and mental health (MH). The first four scores can be summed to create the physical composite score (PCS), while the last four can be summed to create the mental composite score (MCS). Scores for the SF-36 scales range between 0 and 100, with higher scores indicating a better HRQOL</description>
