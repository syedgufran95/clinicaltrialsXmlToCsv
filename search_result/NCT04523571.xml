  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind study, for evaluation of
      safety and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine (BNT162b1) in Chinese healthy
      population. After randomization, the trial for each subject will last for approximately 12
      months. Screening period is 2 weeks prior to randomization (Day -14 to Day 0), and each dose
      of either SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BNT162b1) or placebo will be given intramuscularly (IM).
