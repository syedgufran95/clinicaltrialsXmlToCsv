  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-control clinical trial with
      200 subjects who have never been infected by COVID-19 (SARS-Cov-2 virus screen test negative,
      no blood SARS-Cov-2 IgM and IgG antibodies detected during enrollment) followed by a pilot
      study of 5 subjects to demonstrate the safety of proposed three-dose regimen of autologous
      AdMSCs infusions. The 100 study subjects who have previously banked their AdMSCs with
      Celltex, will receive three doses of autologous AdMSCs (approximately 200 million cells)
      intravenous infusion every three days. The 100 subjects in the control group who have
      previously banked their AdMSCs with Celltex will not receive any Celltex's AdMSC therapy but
      placebo treatments. All subjects are monitored for safety (adverse events/severe adverse
      events), COVID-19 symptoms, SARS-Cov-2 virus test, blood SARS-Cov-2 IgM and IgG antibodies
      tests, blood cytokine and inflammatory (CRP, IL_6, IL-10, TNFα) tests and disease severity
      evaluation for 6 months after the last dose of AdMSC infusion for the study group and 6
      months after the enrollment for the control group.
