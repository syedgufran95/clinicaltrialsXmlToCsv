  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ibuprofen is one of several common medications implicated in coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) severity. On March 11, the Lancet Respiratory Medicine published a letter stating
      ibuprofen can increase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression. On March 14, the
      French Minister of Health tweeted that ibuprofen should be avoided because it will aggravate
      COVID-19. This concern was echoed by scientists and senior doctors in the British Medical
      Journal news on March 17. In response, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a
      recommendation on March 18 to avoid ibuprofen in people with symptoms of COVID-19. However,
      the WHO reversed this recommendation the next day because of insufficient evidence. Health
      Canada issued a safety alert on March 20 stating there was no evidence that ibuprofen worsens
      COVID-19 symptoms. There is some evidence suggesting NSAID use (primarily ibuprofen) can
      increase severity of community acquired bacterial pneumonia in hospitalized children and
      adults. However, we do not know if ibuprofen use alters the course of COVID-19.

      Ibuprofen is an effective analgesic and antipyretic medication. People often use
      over-the-counter cough and cold products containing ibuprofen to manage symptoms of a
      respiratory tract infection before they seek medical attention. Therefore, exposure to
      ibuprofen is highly probable in people with COVID-19 symptoms. Patients, clinicians, and
      policy makers need to know if ibuprofen is safe to use in management of COVID-19 symptoms.

      This case-control study will explore the association between common medications and COVID-19
      severity in a cohort of people tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

    <description>Ibuprofen use will be determined from responses to a survey question asking what over-the-counter medications were used to help manage symptoms before testing for COVID-19. Response options include all brand name analgesic and cough and cold products available in Canada, as well as options to list generic brand products containing ibuprofen or acetaminophen.
If a participant indicates they used both acetaminophen and ibuprofen to manage symptoms, an additional question will ask for the sequence that these analgesics were started. Responses to this question will help us determine if ibuprofen was added for better symptom relief, presumably because symptoms were severe.</description>
