  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current standard of care (SOC) for the management of hospitalized COVID-19 cases differs in
      various North American hospitals, particularly in the pharmacological treatments used, and is
      constantly changing.

      At the moment, available options (depending on the hospital's treatment protocol, the
      physician's medical judgment, contraindications, and disease presentation) include
      hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, remdesivir, ceftriaxone, azithromycin,
      piperacillin-tazobactam, lopinavir-ritonavir, and IL-6 receptor antagonists. In most hospital
      treatment protocols, the use of the latter is generally to be considered in patients with
      evidence of cytokine release syndrome and elevated IL-6, on a case-by-case basis.

      Adults who suffer major COVID-19 complications appear to present a major inflammatory storm.
      Therefore, targeting the inflammatory response may reduce COVID-19-related complications in
      adults at risk or with evidence of an inflammatory storm. EB05 is a potent inhibitor of TLR4,
      a key component of the innate immune system which functions to detect molecules generated by
      pathogens, acting upstream of cytokine storm and IL-6-mediated acute lung injury. EB05 has
      demonstrated safety in two clinical studies (&gt;165 patients) and was able to block LPS-induced
      (TLR4 agonist) IL-6 release in humans. Furthermore, TLR4 blockade rescued mice from lethal
      influenza-induced Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a major cause of mortality
      associated with COVID-19, thus could be useful in the management of COVID-19.

      Given, this extensive body of evidence we believe EB05 could ameliorate ARDS due to COVID-19,
      significantly reducing ventilation rates and mortality.

not hospitalized with resumption of normal activities;
not hospitalized, but unable to resume normal activities;
hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen;

    <description>Stage 1 (Phase II Study) Based on these response rates, a 4:1 ratio of patients treated with EB05 vs. Placebo, a two-sided alpha of 0.05, and 80% power, a total of 295 evaluable patients will be required for Stage 1 (Phase II study), 236 treated with EB05 and 59 treated with Placebo. Allowing for 20% attrition, a total of 355 patients will be enrolled in this Stage.
There will be one blinded, non comparative Interim Analysis during the Phase II study when 50% of the patients (148 evaluable) have reached the 28-day follow-up time point. There will be no between comparisons conducted for this interim analysis; therefore, there is no need for multiplicity considerations. The purpose of the interim analysis will be to validate the assumptions used in the sample size calculations and to assess the inclusion / exclusion criteria as well as the study outcome. Based on the results of this interim analysis, outcome measures and sample size of the Phase II study can be changed.</description>

    <description>Based on the above-mentioned response rates, a 4:1 ratio of patients treated with EB05 vs. Placebo, &gt;90% power, and a two-sided alpha of 0.05 using a z-test, a total of 425 evaluable patients will be required for Stage 2 (Phase III study), 340 treated with EB05 and 85 treated with Placebo. Allowing for 20% attrition, a total of 510 patients will be enrolled in this Stage.
During the Phase III study there will be one blinded, comparative interim analysis when approximately 50% (213) of the evaluable patients have reached the 28-day follow up time period. The results of the interim analysis during the Phase III study will be used to determine whether the study should continue or be terminated early for futility or proven efficacy.</description>

                  to inclusion;

               -  use of chronic oral corticosteroids for a non-COVID-19-related condition in a
