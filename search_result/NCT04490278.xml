    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of a COVID-19 virtual Post Intensive Care
      Syndrome (PICS) clinic (CoV-PICS). The findings from this study are the first steps in
      determining the feasibility and potential impact of a telehealth PICS clinic that is able to
      address the needs of patients with COVID-19 disease and potentially other patients that are
      unable to attend a brick and mortar clinic and require virtual care.
