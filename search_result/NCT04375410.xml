    <textblock>
      During the COVID-19 pandemic after reopening of the country, school, kindergarten and
      daycare, children have been obligated to do frequent handwash. The study group wished to
      investigate whether this has had implications on symptoms of dry, red, itchy or sore hands
      and hand eczema. The investigation was performed within the first and second week after
      reopening by questionnaires distributed to parents electronically via schools, kindergartens
      and daycare facilities electronic platforms.

      During the COVID-19 pandemic Denmark closed down, including schools, kindergartens and
      daycare. After reopening of the country 5 weeks later obligatory frequent handwash was a
      requirement from the government and routines has been implemented at all reopened schools,
      kindergartens and daycare. The study group wished to investigate whether this has had
      implications on symptoms of dry, red, itchy or sore hands and hand eczema. Also the study
      group wished to investigate if frequency or use of hand disinfection mattered. The
      investigation was performed within the first and second week after reopening by
      questionnaires distributed to parents electronically via schools, kindergartens and daycare
      electronic platforms. The questionnaire included 20 questions on demographics, frequency of
      hand wash and use of disinfectants, current and previous symptoms of eczema, atopic
      dermatitis and dispositions.
