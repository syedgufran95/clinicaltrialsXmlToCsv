  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mental health disorders are common during pregnancy and the postnatal period, and can have
      serious adverse effects on the well-being of woman and child. Every tenth woman has
      depressive symptoms and 5% suffer major depression during pregnancy. The consequences for
      global mental health due to the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, are likely to be
      significant and may have long-term impact on the global burden of disease. Pregnant women may
      be particularly vulnerable due to partial immune suppression. Besides physical vulnerability,
      they could be at increased risk of mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression, and
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), due to social distancing leading to less support from
      the family and friends, and in some cases, partners not being allowed to be present during
      prenatal visits, labor and delivery. Furthermore, many pregnant women may feel insecure and
      worried about the effect of COVID-19 on their unborn child, if they get infected during
      pregnancy. Today, young urban women are used to utilizing internet services frequently and
      efficiently. Therefore, providing mental health support to pregnant women via internet may be
      effective in ameliorating their anxiety/depression and reduce the risk of serious mental
      health disorders leading to improved maternal and perinatal outcomes.
