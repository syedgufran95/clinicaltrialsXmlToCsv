      Combination of Chemopreventive agents (All- Trans Retinoic Acid and Tamoxifen) as potential
      treatment for the Lung Complication of COVID-19

      Abstract

      Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) protein found on the cell membranes is the target of
      SARS-CoV-2 for entering into the host cells. Viral spike protein-binding with ACE2
      down-regulates it. As ACE2 is known to protect the lung from injuries, SARS-CoV-2-induced
      ACE2 deficiency may expose patients to lung damage. In this Review, we use established and
      emerging evidence based on the findings of previous studies and researches to propose a
      testable hypothesis that Combination of chemopreventive agents (All Trans Retinoic acid and
      Tamoxifen) can be tested to prevent inflammatory complication in severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 infection via two mechanisms by inhibiting bradykinin B1,B2 receptors
      expression and upregulating the depleted ACE2 in COVID-19 . Bradykinin B1 receptors are not
      expressed under physiological conditions but are induced under inflammatory conditions. Here
      we hypothesize that permanent attack and invasion of COVID-19 to lung epithelial cells via
      binding to ACE2 leads to tissue injury and inflammation and that increases BK levels and
      BK-B2-receptor (B2R) stimulation A study reported that tissue injury and inflammation
      increases BK levels and BK-B2-receptor (B2R) stimulation. We suggest that Bradykinin mediates
      and induces lung injury, proinflammatory cytokines and inflammation likely precipitates life
      threatening respiratory complications in COVID-19. Further experiments showed that BK
      treatment stimulated IL-6 production On the other hand a study reported that cells treated
      with Retinoic acid and Tamoxifen for 48 h significantly decreased the BK-B2 receptor protein
      levels (70.3 ± 0.6% vs. 100% of control, P &lt; 0.05). Retinoids inhibit bradykinin B1
      receptor-sensitized responses and this action could participate in their anti-inflammatory
      and immunomodulatory effects. In addition retinoic acid, is known to possess in vivo
      anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet and fibrinolytic activities. A study investigated the in
      vitro thrombin and platelet aggregation inhibitory activities of retinoic acid and
      retinaldehyde.Retinoic acid, retinaldehyde and retinol exhibited potent inhibition of
      thrombin, with IC50 values of 67μg/ml, 74μg/ml and 152μg/ml, respectively for the inhibition
      of thrombin (Sigma); and 49μg/ml, 74μg/ml and 178μg/ml, respectively for the inhibition of
      thrombin (plasma). Amongst vitamin A and its derivatives, retinoic acid showed the highest
      inhibition of both the forms of thrombin. Beside the effectiveness of TAM on cancer cells, it
      also has other effects on numerous microbes including parasite, fungi, bacteria, and some
      viruses such as Ebola virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).Furthermore Tamoxifen can
      block the action of interleukin 6 and inhibit neutrophils. A study demonstrated that
      tamoxifen has side effects associated with neutropenia. Since tamoxifen can cause neutropenia
      and subsequently influence the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) value In addition it has
      anti malarial effect similar to chloroquine In conclusion
