  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicentre prospective cohort trial is designed to demonstrate effectiveness and
      efficiency of a virtual care model for the management of COVID-19 patients isolating at home.
      The investigators have reoriented existing technology and networks for this research project.
      The investigators are amplifying our existing virtual care platform VIRTUES, combining it
      with home monitoring of COVID-19 patients, to provide real-time evidence, harmonize data
      collection, and share data provincially to mitigate the impact of the rapid spread of the
      virus. The study will facilitate early detection of complications associated with the
      disease, treatment and management of COVID-19 patients at home. The research will be
      conducted provincially in Ontario.

      This initiative will provide evidence to inform clinical and health system management and
      public health response to COVID-19 patients isolating at home.

    <description>VIRTUES COVID-19 Care at Home Platform
The components of the platform will include:
Vital sign monitoring, including O2 saturation with a home-based pulse oximeter, temperature and respiratory rate performed three times per day (a notification to do this will be sent from the app), with the option of doing assessments more frequently if needed. Study patients will be provided monitoring devices to collect this data.
Symptom logs will be entered by the patients.
Feedback to the patient by the local COVID-19 care team for any action:
Two-way communication between the patient and the COVID-19 care team
Ability for team members to see all prior notes in order to have continuity of care
Reports of these interactions are transmitted to the patient's health record
Current information on COVID-19 as per the Public Health Agency of Canada</description>
