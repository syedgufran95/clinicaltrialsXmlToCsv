  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a mechanistic, observational, prospective, case and control study, to compare
      platelet aggregation, analyzed by Multiplate-ADP, in hospitalized patients diagnosed with
      COVID-19 versus healthy controls. Thus will be included 50 patients who present with
      respiratory symptoms within 72 hours of hospitalization and confirmation of the diagnosis of
      COVID-19 by laboratory method (RT -PCR and / or positive serology for SARS-CoV-2 - COVID
      group); this group will be compared to 50 healthy individuals (asymptomatic and with negative
      SARS-CoV-2 serology), matched by sex and age to the previous group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with atherothrombotic
      phenomena. However, platelet activity in COVID-19 has not yet been studied.

      Thus, the main objective of this project is to evaluate platelet aggregation by the
      Multiplate-ADP method in hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19, in comparison with
      the platelet aggregation evaluated by the same method in healthy controls.

      Secondary objectives include the assessment of parameters related to coagulation,
      inflammation, and clinical outcome variables.

      This is a mechanistic, observational, prospective, case and control study, which will include
      50 patients who present with respiratory symptoms within 72 hours of hospitalization and
      confirmation of the diagnosis of COVID-19 by laboratory method (RT -PCR and / or positive
      serology for SARS-CoV-2 - COVID group); this group will be compared to 50 healthy individuals
      (asymptomatic and with negative SARS-CoV-2 serology), matched by sex and age to the previous
      group.
