  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most research on the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 disease relate to screening
      measures, development of vaccines and optimising treatment of hospitalised patients. It is
      likely that this pandemic will be ongoing for several years until a high level of immunity is
      reached in the population or a vaccine has been developed. Thus, there is a need of measures
      to help the SARS-CoV-2 infected individual at home to overcome the course of disease with
      less symptoms and strain. A Positive Expiratory Pressure (PEP) flute is feasible for home use
      and it is possible that regular use of PEP flute may prevent the progression of respiratory
      symptoms in non-hospitalized individuals with COVID-19 disease.

      The primary objective of the study is to examine the effect of PEP flute use among SARS-CoV-2
      infected, non-hospitalized patients on self-reported change in COPD Assessment Test (CAT)
      score during 30 days of follow-up.

      The secondary objectives are to compare the development in hospitalization rates and use of
      antibiotics in the intervention group and the control group during the follow-up period.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that the PEP flute has positive effects on SARS-CoV-2 infected
      individual's self-reported respiratory symptoms such as dyspnoea, coughing and perceived
      mucus clearance through beneficial effects on lung function and airway clearance.
      Furthermore, the investigators expect a lower rate of hospitalization and use of antibiotics
      in the intervention group as compared to the control group.

      Finally, potential subgroup effects by gender, age, comorbidity and BMI at study entry will
      be explored for all outcomes.

      Based upon a sample size estimation the investigators assess that inclusion of 200
      participants in each intervention arm will be an adequate number. Based on the present
      testing strategy and COVID-19 incidence, current expectations are that two months should be
      enough to recruit 400 patients. The investigators will allow for recruitment to the end of
      December 2020, but will terminate enrolment at n = 400.

      Link to detailed protocol paper will be added once published.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is designed as a randomised, controlled, open-label trial with two parallel groups and a primary endpoint of CAT-score after 30 days of intervention.
Randomization lists will be computer-generated using an appropriate statistical software and based upon permuted random blocks. The allocation ratio will be 1:1 stratified for the following baseline conditions:
Sex
Age (â‰¥60 and &lt;60 years)</intervention_model_description>
    <primary_purpose>Prevention</primary_purpose>
    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Outcome assessors will be blinded to treatment allocation where possible. This is of outmost importance, and participants are requested not to disclose their allocation when outcomes are assessed. To test the blinding efficacy, the outcome assessors are asked what treatment strategy they think a patient has received after assessments.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported CAT-score (COPD Assessment Test)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>CAT-scores will be measured using a telephone administered questionnaire. The CAT-score is validated to evaluate symptoms in COPD patients. Eight items covers symptoms of cough, sputum, chest pain, dyspnoea, activities of daily living at home, feeling safe at home despite symptoms (modified for the present study from feeling safe at leaving home despite symptoms), sleep quality and vigour. The eight items sum up to a range of 0-40 with higher scores indicating more respiratory impairment. Although validated for COPD-use, the CAT-scale is considered useful in the present study because several of the items (dyspnoea, cough, fatigue, sputum and pleuritic chest pain) previously have been used as outcome variables in pneumonia studies. The outcome assessment can be taken within + 1 week for the scheduled visit.</description>

    <description>The participants will be handed three airway resistances equivalent to a resistance of 10-20 cm H2O alongside one PEP flute. Two videos will guide the participants in use of the PEP flute; one with instructions of the rationale and how to use the flute, including how to choose the suitable resistance and one video, which gives instructions of hygienic maintenance.
Participants in the intervention group will be advised to continue use of their PEP flute in the active intervention period of 30 days or at least if they still have respiratory symptoms. They will receive daily text-messages to prompt their reporting and to use the PEP flute according to instructions.</description>

    <description>The participants in the control group will receive daily text-messages to prompt their reporting of CAT-scores. To avoid attrition of the trial due to early recovery of symptoms, the project manager will call the participants by phone at day 15 to ask them about their present condition (i.e. CAT-score) and address potential concerns of continued participation of the trial. Otherwise, they will only receive usual care.</description>
