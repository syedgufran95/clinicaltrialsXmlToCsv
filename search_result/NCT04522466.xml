  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, no treatment has demonstrated clinical efficacy on COVID 19. However, several
      therapeutic strategies are being considered and are being evaluated in numerous clinical
      trials. Among these strategies, the use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) seems promising. There is
      very little information on how to precisely administer hydroxychloroquine to patients
      infected with SARS-CoV-2 in intensive care, which may be responsible for side effects, some
      of which are potentially serious. In addition, this treatment has a long half-life which
      increases the risk of accumulation and therefore toxicity. In view of the lack of knowledge
      on the pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic properties of hydroxychloroquine in intensive care
      patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, we propose to perform a prospective multicenter cohort
      study in order to collect the biological data necessary for this evaluation.
