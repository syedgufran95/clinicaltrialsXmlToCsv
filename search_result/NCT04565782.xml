  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new strain of coronavirus that caused severe respiratory disease in infected individuals
      was initially identified in China's Wuhan City in December 2019. Severe acute respiratory
      distress syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was responsible for the corona virus
      infectious disease-2019 (COVID-19).The World Health Organization declared that COVID-19 was a
      Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30,2020.

      The impact of COVID-19 in liver recipients remains largely unknown but accumulating
      experience is going on.

      Liver transplant recipients should have been classified as a risk group and should have
      received regular surveillance for COVID-19 throughout the pandemic.

      Some reports suggest decreasing immunosuppression for infected recipients, if no recent
      rejection episodes. Paradoxically, others suggest that a reactive immune response might be
      the cause for severe tissue damage, and that immunosuppression might be protective from the
      postulated cytokine storm.

      Some studies stated that the LT patients who are permanently on immunosuppressants could be
      particularly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, and their prognosis could be worse in comparison to
      the normal population. They recommended that LT recipients should be closely monitored for
      SARS-CoV-2.

      The LT society of India (LTSI) highlighted the potential of LT recipients as asymptomatic
      carriers and source of viral spread, and that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted to LT recipients.
      There are insufficient data on the relationship between immunosuppressive therapy and
      COVID-19 in LT recipients during this pandemic. However, the Beijing working party for liver
      transplantation suggested that LT recipients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 should be
      treated with steroids for a short period to reduce the severity of pneumonia.

      They also suggested that immunosuppressive therapies should be continued for both patients
      with mild COVID-19 and those who were not infected by the virus, and calcineurin inhibitor
      treatment dosage should be reduced in moderate to severe cases.

      Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) play an important role in virus clearance and have been
      considered as a key immune product for protection or treatment against viral diseases.
      Virus-specific NAbs, induced through either infection or vaccination, have the ability to
      block viral infection. SARS-CoV -2 specific NAbs reached their peak in patients from day
      10-15 after the onset of the disease and remained stable thereafter in the patients.
      Antibodies targeting on different domains of S protein, including S1, RBD, and S2, may all
      contribute to the neutralization.

      Al-Rajhi Liver Center is the only liver transplantation center in Upper Egypt that performed
      only 51 living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) cases since 2014, but it was used as
      isolation Hospital for COVID-19 cases from March to July, 2020. Communication with liver
      transplant cases during that period was via Telemedicine. Resuming usual Hospital activity as
      Tertiary Liver Center occurred in 15 August 2020. Similarly, other Hospitals in Egypt were
      designated as COVID-19 isolation Hospitals.

      1. Liver Transplant recipients in 3 liver transplant centers will answer survey including
           21 questions (14 questions covers the demographic data, date since the operation and
           immunosuppressant medications and 11 questions related to Corona virus infection).
           (SARS-CoV-2 infection will be defined according to the Ministry of Health and population
           definitions of suspected and confirmed cases).

        2. Doing serological test searching for Neutralizing Ab against SARS-Corona virus 2 in the
           liver transplant recipients who accepted to give blood sample.

      (It can be detected by Electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) method.
