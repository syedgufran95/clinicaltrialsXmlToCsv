    <textblock>
      The main objective of the ANACONDA-COVID-19 trial is to assess the efficacy of Anakinra +
      optimized Standard of Care (oSOC) as compared to oSOC alone on the condition of patients with
      COVID-19 infection and worsening respiratory symptoms. Success defined as patient alive and
      free of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and free of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation
      (ECMO) at Day 14.
