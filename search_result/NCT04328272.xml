      To find the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine alone and adjuvant with azithromycin in mild
      to severe Covide-19 pneumonia patients admitted to Coronavirus cell/ward of Ayub Teaching
      hospital, Abbottabad Pakistan. A single centered, single-blind randomized control trial

      Coronavirus (SARS-nCoV-2) is a member family coronaviridae, order Nidovirales. It is
      single-stranded, positive sense enveloped RNA discovered in early 1960s. Coronavirus pandemic
      put a lot of lives at stake. By 19 March 2020, a total of 219238 confirmed cases with 8967
      being dead and 85742 recovered cases have been reported. Worldwide, in 9 days, the confirmed
      death cases have been doubled. The average death rate of Covid-19 per day is approximately 88
      patients as of the given date. Unlike, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the disease progression and
      mortality rate of Covid-19 is startling. The pre-pathogenic course of novel Covid-19 is yet
      to be determined, so the risk factors, clinical picture and medical intervention too. Only
      supportive therapy is being practised. Yet many trials of antimalarial drug, chloroquine and
      quinolone is currently taking place worldwide. According to Cortegiani A, 23 ongoing trials
      from China have been registered. Clinical experience from recent Wuhan epidemic came up with
      promising results of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 positive patients. Some
      in-vitro studies suggest that these immunomodulant drugs can interfere with SARS-nCov-2
      replication. These are federal drug authority approved medicine for malaria. Yet their
      effectiveness and safety in treating Covid-19 pneumonia is a question mark.
