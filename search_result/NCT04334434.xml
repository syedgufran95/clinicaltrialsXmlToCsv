  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) erupted in Wuhan (Hubei, China) and
      quickly spread from a single city to the entire country in just 30 days and then attracted
      worldwide attention. COVID-19 causes a large number of deaths due to its occurrence in many
      cases. This virus caused a total of 549,461 approved cases and 24,887 deaths worldwide. All
      the countries of the world take some precautions to prevent the spread of this epidemic
      disease, which WHO declared it as &quot;pandemic&quot;. Staying home and social isolation are at the
      top of these precautions. For this purpose, in Turkey on March 21, 2020, '65 and older
      individuals began to apply the curfew to individuals with chronic illnesses. However, not
      leaving the house and social isolation brings with it the limitation of physical activity.
      Physical activity (PA) is defined by WHO as any bodily movement produced by the contraction
      of skeletal muscles that increases energy consumption. Recommended PA levels for the elderly
      (≥65 years) are similar to adults (18 to 64 years old). At the global level, approximately
      45% of people over the age of 60 do not meet the recommended level of PA. Studies
      investigating the relationship between social isolation and health behavior report consistent
      findings. Individuals with smaller social networks report less healthy diets, excessive
      alcohol consumption, and less physical activity. The effects of social isolation are related
      to physical inactivity, smoking and the possibility of having both health risk behaviors
      together. The decrease in physical performance is associated with the risk of falling,
      sarcopenia, fragility, decreased quality of life, emotionalization, comorbidity, early death,
      and increased health care costs. Practical and innovative interventions are needed to reduce
      the decline in muscle mass, strength and physical performance in the aging population. When
      today's conditions are evaluated, technology-supported education programs are effective in
      increasing the motivation for physical activity. The purpose of this study; to evaluate the
      physical activity level of individuals over the age of 65 who experience social isolation due
      to the precautions taken in our country to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, and
      to investigate the effectiveness of home-based telerehabilitation exercises. It is aimed to
      use an innovative model based on the digitally supported, home-based exercise program.

    <description>One of the evaluation parameters created to evaluate the physical activity level of elderly individuals, the factors affecting the activity level, the relationship between physical activity and health profile is the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly. The minimum score that can be obtained from the scale is 0 and the maximum score is 400. The higher score on the scale indicates a better level of physical activity.</description>

    <description>15 volunteers over 65 years old who are at home during the social isolation process due to the coronavirus outbreak will be included in this group. An online exercise protocol was created for individuals who will participate in the study. Each exercise session was planned as 30 minutes for 3 days a week for 4 weeks. It was planned to start the protocol with warm-up exercises and finish with cooling exercises. The exercise protocol was additionally determined as a combination of aerobic and strengthening exercises. Individuals were asked to participate in the study via Skype and aimed to do their exercises with a physiotherapist</description>
