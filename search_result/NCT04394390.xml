      Blood vitamin D levels may be associated with COVID-19 disease severity, we aimed to find out
      whether blood 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels were correlated with COVID-19 disease
      severity or noy.

      Purpose:

      Vitamin D a steroid hormone has profound effects on human immunity. Active vitamin D,
      1,25(OH)2D acts as an immune system modulator, preventing excessive expression of
      inflammatory cytokines and increasing the 'oxidative burst' potential of macrophages.
      Epidemiological data has linked vitamin D deficiency to increased susceptibility to acute
      viral respiratory infections. There is evidence that some patients with severe COVID-19
      experience a cytokine storm with production of large quantities of interleukins, specifically
      IL-1 and IL-6. Moreover it was hipotiesied that the sufficient vitamin D levels may help to
      decrease IL-6 levels like tocizulamab which is a potent blocking agent of the IL-6 receptor.
      In present trial we aimed to find out is there a relation between the disease and vitamin D
      levels in COVİD-19 patients.

      Material and Methods:

      To find out vitamin D levels and it's relation with the disease severity serum
      25-hydroxy-vitamin D levels will be measured in nearly 100 confirmed COVİD-19 patients. Same
      patients will also be evaluated for vital signs, laboratory and pulmoner CT findings.
      Demographic and medical data will also be collected. Statically significant positive or
      negative results and the comparison of these findings will be presented.

      We think that revealing the vitamin- D levels and it's possible relation with disease
      severity may inspire new perspectives for future trials and treatments that spesifically
      focused on the novel corona virus disease.
