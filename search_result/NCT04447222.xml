  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study uses questionnaires to gain an understanding of how experiences during the
      COVID-19 pandemic, regardless of COVID-19 status, may have impacted health-related quality of
      life (HRQOL) and other areas such as COVID-19-specific psychological distress, disruptions to
      health care, finances and social interactions in cancer patients. The coronavirus disease
      2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that is caused by the severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The information learned from this study will guide the
      development of psychosocial programs to improve patient care and outcomes in cancer patients
      and survivors in the context of facing a global pandemic.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess experiences during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (e.g.,
      exposure, risk factors, testing, isolation, seropositivity, hospitalization, loss of family
      or friends); COVID-19-specific psychological distress (e.g., fear, anxiety and depressive
      symptoms); health, financial and social disruptions; perceived benefits and social support;
      and HRQoL and other psychosocial and behavioral factors in cancer survivors who participated
      in one of three prior clinical trials.

      II. Evaluate the extent to which COVID-19 experiences are associated with COVID-19 specific
      psychological distress, health, financial and social disruptions, perceived benefits and
      social support, and HRQoL.

      III. Evaluate the extent to which resiliency factors such as social support and perceived
      benefits assessed concurrently and other psychosocial measures assessed in the prior trials
      moderate the effects of COVID-19 experiences on COVID-19-specific psychological distress and
      HRQoL.

      IV. Examine group differences in the outcomes assessed in the protocol relative to prior
      group assignment in the behavioral clinical trials.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants complete a survey online over 35-45 minutes about their experiences regarding
      the COVID-19 pandemic.

    <measure>The extent to which COVID-19 experiences are associated with COVID-19 specific psychological distress, health, financial and social disruptions, perceived benefits and social support, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Will be tested using path analysis. Path analyses also provides an opportunity to test direct and indirect or mediation effects. Significance and goodness of fit of the model will be interpreted using several indices. A Comparative Fit Index (CFI) value of 0.90 or greater and a Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) of 0.08 or less will be used to establish model fit. The Lagrange multiplier and the Wald tests will be used to guide model modifications.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Resiliency factors</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using a COVID-19 questionnaire. Responses are provided on a Likert scale (from 1 to 4) where participants are asked to rank statements from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree.&quot; The measure provides a total score summary that indicates the degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the participant. Items that tap into resiliency are reverse scored. Will use multigroup analyses by levels of the moderator to identify differences in the magnitude of the associations based on the level of the moderator.</description>
