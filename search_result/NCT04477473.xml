  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Swiss population underwent a period of confinement related to the COVID-19 pandemic
      (March 16 to May 11, 2020) decided by the Swiss Federal Government. Among the Swiss
      population, certain groups were identified as vulnerable subjects by the Federal Office of
      Public Health. This study focuses on the perceived impact of this period on health care and
      health status in a specific vulnerable group: patients under long term noninvasive
      ventilation (respiratory support) at home for chronic respiratory failure.

      The Swiss population underwent a period of confinement related to the COVID-19 pandemic
      (March 16 to May 11, 2020) decided by the Swiss Federal Government. Among the Swiss
      population, certain groups were identified as vulnerable subjects by the Federal Office of
      Public Health. This study focuses on the perceived impact of this period on health care and
      health status in a specific vulnerable group: patients under long term noninvasive
      ventilation (respiratory support) at home for chronic respiratory failure.

      The objective is to determine, in a specific vulnerable group, how the confinement related to
      the COVID-19 pandemic affected health care and health status, as perceived by the patients.

      The primary outcome is a questionnaire focusing on practical health care issues regarding
      respiratory support, health status and perception of the COVID-19 issue:

        -  Symptom score (related to noninvasive ventilation: NIV)

        -  Thymic disturbances (score of anxiety and depression)

        -  Compliance to treatment (assessed via tele-monitoring: routine procedure)

      It is a non-interventional questionnaire-based observational study of patients followed by
      the Division of Pulmonology of Geneva University Hospitals with home NIV, aged above 18 years
      of age and in a stable clinical condition.

    <description>Questionnaire focusing on practical health care issues regarding respiratory support, health status and perception of the COVID-19 issue:
Symptom score (related to noninvasive ventilation: NIV): S3-NIV (non-invasive ventilation), score ranging from 0 to 10, the lowest possible score (0) corresponds to the highest impact of disease and treatment, the highest possible score (10) corresponds to the lowest impact of disease and treatment.
Thymic disturbances (score of anxiety and depression): HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), score ranging from 0 to 21, 0-7 = normal, 8-10 borderline abnormal, 11-21 =abnormal

        The population chosen (patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure treated by
        noninvasive ventilation) is:

          -  One of the main focuses of interest of our research group, for close to 30 years

          -  One of our main clinical activities in our outpatient pulmonary division

          -  An interesting group because, although these subjects must be considered as vulnerable
             in case of COVID-19, they have - albeit for COPD - a prognosis of several years of
             survival

          -  A group for which the findings of our study can be rapidly translated into adapting
             clinical practice and management

          -  An interesting group because although they are often very limited in their activities
             of daily life (ADL), they are also very resilient, with remarkable coping strategies
