  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is currently involving all parts of the
      world. Several risk factors for critical illness and death from the disease have been
      proposed. However, the observed associations between different comorbidities and chronic
      medications have not fully been related to the frequencies of the same comorbidities and
      chronic medications in age- and sex-matched controls from the general population. This is
      important since some of the proposed risk factors are very common in the aged who, by age
      alone, are more prone to a more severe course of the disease.

      By combining several registries, we will compare, on several comorbidities such as
      hypertension and diabetes and several medications such as immunosuppressant drugs and
      Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors, the first 2000 cases of COVID-19 patients
      receiving critical care in Sweden to a set 8000 age- and sex-matched controls.

      Data sources:

      Registries of the Swedish board of Health and wellfare:

        1. The patient registry containing information including diagnostic codes from all
           specialized Healthcare contacts in Sweden. Reporting i governed by law.

        2. The Swedish Prescribed Drug Register to which all dispensations from pharmacies of
           prescribed drugs are reported.

      Statistics Sweden is the agency responsible for the official population statistics of Sweden.
      They will draw our controls from the Registry of the total population.

      The Swedish Intensive Care Registry (SIR) contains all intensive care episodes in Sweden.
      They have information on Intensive Care (ICU) admission, diagnoses, interventions and
      outcomes.

      The study design is combined prospective ond retrospective. The data is prospectively
      collected to the registries but the study protocol is retrospectively designed.

        The SIR is a registry to which all Swedish intensive care units are reporting all intensive
        care patients. The SIR has a specific part to wich all CIVID-19 related intensive care
        eposodes are reported. We will include, as cases, all patients, approximally 2000, who have
        at least one COVID-19 listing in the registry. Statistics Sweden will draw a random sample
        of age and sex matched controls, 4 per case, from all residents of Sweden, approximately 10
        million.
