  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which first appeared in China, in December
      2019 and is now spreading worldwide and poses a great threat to public health. In 12th July
      2020, the total number of cases worldwide was about 13 million cases with case fatality rate
      of 4.4% and in Egypt the total cases was 81158 and case fatality rate was 4.6%. (1,2).

      In recent years, novel coronaviruses emerge periodically in different areas around the world.
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) occurred in 2002, which reportedly
      infected 8422 people with about 10% case fatality rate (3). Middle East respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, bringing a total of 1401
      MERS-CoV infections, and about 35% case fatality rate (1). All the infection cases and recent
      epidemics show that coronaviruses impose a continuous threat to human beings and the economy
      as they emerge unexpectedly, spread easily, and lead to catastrophic consequences.

      As the number of recovered patients with COVID-19 continues to be increasing, the strength
      and duration of immunity after infection is an important point to be studied. Moreover,
      understanding this issue is a critical point for controlling this epidemic as they are the
      key for herd immunity and for informing decisions on how and when to ease physical distancing
      restrictions and to be ready for other waves of the infection. There is currently no evidence
      if the people who have recovered from COVID-19 have antibodies and protected from a second
      attack of infection or future wave of this pandemic or not. Therefore, we will carry out a
      longitudinal study of immunity in recovered patients to assess SARS-Cov2 patients' risk for
      future reinfection.
