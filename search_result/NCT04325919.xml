  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 may cause another world-wide epidemic. This study is divided into 2 arms: (1)
      Prospective longitudinal observational study involving patients with laboratory-confirmed
      COVID-19 and (2) Retrospective study on patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.

      Arm 1:

      We will collect EDTA blood, stool samples, rectal swab, urine, saliva, and specimens from
      upper respiratory tract (nasopharyngeal aspirate or flocked swab), and lower respiratory
      tract (sputum or tracheal aspirate) on daily, alternate day, or weekly basis as appropriate.

      Arm 2:

      The remainder of specimens that were submitted for laboratory investigation as part of
      clinical management will be retrieved. Those specimens will only be used after all clinically
      indicated testing and confirmation procedures have been completed. Assistance from the Public
      Health Laboratory Service, Department of Health, will be invited to retrieve samples as well
      as participate in this study.

      Patients hospitalized for pneumonia in medical wards and ICU at the Prince of Wales Hospital
      tested negative for COVID-19 will be recruited as controls.

      Understanding the clinical, virological, microbiological and immunological profiles of this
      infection is urgently needed to facilitate its management and control.
