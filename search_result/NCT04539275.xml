      The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with convalescent plasma improves the
      clinical outcomes of Veterans who are hospitalized and require supplemental oxygen due to
      COVID-19.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As of August 25, 2020, SARS-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19) infections are approaching 6
      million persons and 180,000 deaths in the US. Of the 20% of patients admitted to hospital, up
      to half progress to ICU admission, respiratory failure or death. Prominent among these
      progressors are older men, particularly those with underlying comorbidities (e.g.,
      hypertension, diabetes, lung, heart, kidney or liver disease, obesity and immunocompromised),
      all common among Veterans. There are no drugs or other therapeutics approved by the FDA to
      prevent or treat COVID-19 infection.

      Convalescent plasma therapy is being used empirically, although only five of six small
      uncontrolled case series (total n=56) in SARS-CoV-23-8 and a recent study with non-randomized
      controls suggest improved selected clinical, virologic and laboratory outcomes; outcomes in
      another small randomized trial were equivocal. For other infections, such as influenza and
      Ebola virus, promising observational studies were not reliably confirmed by controlled
      trials. In multiple infections, use of convalescent plasma has been distinguished by its
      safety profile but not by the consistency of its benefit.

      The current double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT is designed to determine definitively
      whether this intervention is effective in a population at high risk of complications and
      death from SARS-CoV-2 infection. The investigators compare the effect of convalescent plasma
      vs. saline placebo with a robust study design, adequate sample size and statistical and
      logistical rigor to assure that the interventions the investigators make to treat serious
      disease are well-validated to support its use or to move on to test other potentially safe
      and effective treatments.

      This study is taking place at approximately 25 VA Medical Centers located across the US. A
      participant's involvement will last up to 33 days. The entire study, from the date the first
      person enters until the last participant is seen, is expected to last about 20 months.

      Data collected for this study will be analyzed and stored at the Palo Alto Cooperative
      Studies Program Coordinating Center (CSPCC). After the study is completed, the de-identified,
      archived data will continue to be stored at the Palo Alto CSPCC, accessible for use by
      researchers including those outside of the study with an approved Data Use Agreement. The
      biospecimens collected in the study for current and future research will be kept at the VA
      Biorepository in Palo Alto, CA unless otherwise specified. The biospecimens will be
      accessible for future research with an approved Sample Use Agreement. The VA CIRB will
      oversee the biorepository for this study. All samples will be destroyed by standard practice
      within 20 years of study completion. Sample destruction will be validated according to the
      Standard Operating Procedures of the VA Biorepository.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Veterans must meet ALL of the following criteria to be eligible to participate:

          1. Admitted to a participating VA clinical site with symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2
             infection.

          2. Participant (or legally authorized representative) provides informed consent prior to
             initiation of any study procedures.

          3. Participant (or legally authorized representative) understands and agrees to comply
             with planned study procedures.

          4. Veteran 18 years of age at time of screening.

          5. Has laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by polymerase chain
             reaction (PCR) or antigen test, as documented by either of the following:

        (1)RT-PCR or antigen positive (nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, saliva, lower respiratory) in
        sample collected 72 hours prior to screening; (2)RT-PCR or antigen positive in sample
        collected &gt; 72 hours but 168 hours (i.e. 7 days) prior to screening, documented inability
        to obtain a repeat sample (e.g. due to lack of testing supplies, limited testing capacity,
        results taking &gt; 24 hours, etc.), AND progressive disease suggestive of ongoing SARS-CoV-2
        infection.

        6.Requiring oxygen by nasal cannula or by face-mask as a new treatment (or if previously on
        home oxygen, at a liter flow at least 2 Lpm greater than home prescription), but not on
        humidified heated high-flow nasal cannula (HHHFNC) at 15 Lpm.

        7.Can be randomized within 72 hours of hospital admission. 8.Agrees not to participate in
        another therapeutic clinical trial for the treatment of COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 through Day
        29 without approval from the investigator(s). Taking part in other research studies,
        including those unrelated to SARS-CoV-2, without first discussing it with the investigators
        of this study may invalidate the results of this study, as well as that of the other study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation
        in this study:

          1. Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, non-invasive ventilation
             including CPAP (for an indication other than previously diagnosed sleep apnea and
             maintained on outpatient settings), or extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation or
             anticipated to require any of those treatments or to die within 24 hours.

          2. Anticipated discharge from the hospital or transfer to another hospital that is not a
             study site within 72 hours.

          3. History of previous transfusion reaction.

          4. Previously documented serum IgA deficiency (&lt;7 mg/dL)

          5. Documented to have received convalescent plasma in the last 60 days.
