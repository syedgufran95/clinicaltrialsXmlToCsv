  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE: There is very limited literature available on the arrhythmia
      occurrence in the context of an infection by the SARS-CoV2 virus. On the other hand,
      treatment strategies against the SARS-CoV2 virus may carry a risk of QTc prolongation and
      pro-arrhythmia/sudden death which may be amplified by concomitant use of other QTc-prolonging
      drugs and/or ion disbalances. COVIDAR is an international initiative to monitor the
      occurrence of arrhythmic events in the context of the SARS-CoV2 infection, to identify
      potential modifiable predisposing factors to reduce their incidence and to inform the best
      arrhythmia management options in this patient population.

      MAIN OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence and type of arrhythmic events in the context of the
      SARS-CoV2 infection.

      STUDY DESIGN: patient registry (observational). Patients will not undergo any additional
      investigations. Only data that is generated during routine clinical care will be collected.

      STUDY POPULATION: Patients admitted to the hospital highly suspected of or with confirmed
      COVID-19.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COVIDAR Registry is an international longitudinal multicentre observational study
      worldwide which aims to assess the incidence, type and risk factors of arrhythmias in the
      context of SARS-CoV2 infection, also providing relevant information on events/management and
      major cardiovascular outcomes. During the course of the registry patients will be followed up
      according to the usual practice of the centres. Drug prescriptions and indications to perform
      diagnostic/therapeutic procedures will be completely left to the treating physicians.

      The registry population will consist of patients presenting with a suspicion of SARS-CoV2
      infection, who are hospitalised in a medical or surgical department of the participating
      hospitals. Patients will officially be enrolled in the COVIDAR Registry if the COVID-19
      disease has formally been noted or confirmed in the patient's medical record.

      The registry will include all patients and collect data at the following timepoints:

        -  Admission: evaluation before SARS-CoV2 infection treatment initiation

        -  On-treatment: evaluation 24-28h after treatment initiation

        -  At any adverse event: evaluation if any adverse event occurs

        -  At discharge: evaluation of clinical status at the end of the admission period.
