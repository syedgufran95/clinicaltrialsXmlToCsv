  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The question of the immune response of the population, particularly of professional
      populations in contact with vulnerable populations (such as those with chronic conditions
      such as cancer), is an important issue. Knowing the evolution of this response over time in
      this population can help answer outstanding questions. The PRO-SERO-COV study is a
      seroprevalence study of caregivers working in the hospital sector with a follow-up at 3
      months and 12 months. The objective is to evaluate and monitor at 3 and 12 months the
      serological immune status to an infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in active volunteer
      professionals working at the Institut Bergonié with different types of exposure: healthcare
      professionals and professionals in other services.
