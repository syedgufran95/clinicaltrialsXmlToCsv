    <textblock>
      This is an expanded access treatment protocol to treat up to 100 subjects with severe or
      life-threatening, laboratory confirmed COVID-19 with COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Subjects
      will receive 1-2 units (200-400 mL per unit, not to exceed 550 mL total) of ABO compatible,
      low isohemagglutinin titer, COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Plasma will be administered one
      unit per day for up to two days. The duration of infusion will usually take 1 to 2 hours
      (rate of 100 to 250 mL/hr). The infusion should not exceed 4 hours. Plasma infusions will be
      administered following standard institutional procedures, including the use of premedications
      (e.g. acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, etc.) as necessary.
