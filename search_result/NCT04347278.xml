  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The infection caused by COVID19 worldwide makes it necessary to monitor drugs administered
      for the treatment of patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2. In order to know more about the
      efficacy and safety of the treatments used, researchers from the Cantabrian health service
      have developed an observational study, in the form of an ambispective registry, in which
      clinical data from patients treated with the different drugs currently recommended by the
      Spanish Agency of Medicines and Health Products (SAMHP) and the Ministry of Health, or others
      that may arise, are collected and analyzed.

      Although the conduct of clinical trials is a priority at this time, we cannot lose the
      clinical experience that is currently being generated, which may allow us to improve the
      therapeutic strategies for future patients.
