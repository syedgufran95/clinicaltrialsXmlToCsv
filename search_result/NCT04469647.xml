  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthcare workers play a critical role in fighting the pandemic, not only by managing the
      patients' health clinically, but also by implementing adequate measures for infection
      prevention and control in healthcare facilities. This puts healthcare workers at a greater
      risk of acquiring the disease. COVID-19 is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
      Coronavirus -2 (SARS-CoV-2) and many people can be infected with it asymptomatically and
      undetectably.

      Serology is an antibody test that provides additional information to polymerase
      chain-reaction (PCR) testing as it is the only way to reliably establish the fraction of the
      population that was infected . Seroconversion is the development of antibodies in the blood
      which can confirm suspected cases after the fact and reveal who was infected but asymptomatic
      and never realized it. Antibodies are specific proteins created as the body's response to the
      infection and this test is essential for detecting infected individuals with few or no
      symptoms at all.
