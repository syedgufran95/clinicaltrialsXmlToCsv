    <textblock>
      The purpose of this epidemiologic study is to estimate the prevalence and incidence of
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in at-risk, exposed, affected populations. The study will also
      estimate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in target population.

      This study is not for real-time diagnostic purposes, guidance for patient care, or the
      development of a diagnostic test. The research tests performed for this study will not be
      prioritized over clinical care samples, that research samples will be batched and tested
      after clinical care samples. This study is a population-based epidemiologic analysis of
      prevalence of various groups of persons.

      Group (1) general healthy population. People 18 years of age and older that have not tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 and who have not sought medical help in the previous 4 months.

      Group (2) Medical School Residents , 18 years of age and older that have not tested positive
      for SARS-CoV-2 Group (3) Individuals who are HIV positive. People 18 years of age and older
      that have not tested positive for SARS-CoV-2

    <description>Blood: Two tubes of blood (up to 10 ml each) will be drawn from participants and will be collected by experienced phlebotomists.
Nasal, oral, and rectal swabs: Nasal, oral, and rectal swabs are optional specimens that patients may be asked to donate. If prospective consent is provided, swabs will be self-collected by participants after receiving clear instructions from the team and collected in the dedicated container.
Saliva: Saliva is an optional specimen that patients may be asked to donate. If prospective consent is provided, whole saliva samples will be self-collected by participants using a pad placed between the cheek and gum for 2-5 minutes or collecting the saliva directly to a sterile container.</description>

      With the participant's approval, and as approved by IRB, de-identified biological samples
      will be stored and tested for anti- SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM. These samples may be used in
      future COVID-19 studies to develop assays or study other features of the disease. These
      leftovers may be used for multiple basic science analysis and potentially for genetic
      testing. The consent process will explain this to prospective participants.

      During the conduct of the study, an individual participant can choose to withdraw consent to
      have biological specimens stored for future research. However, withdrawal of consent with
      regard to biosample storage will not be possible after the study is completed. The consent
      process will explain this to prospective participants.
