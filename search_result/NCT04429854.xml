      This a phase II, proof-of-concept study. In the present study, we investigate if the
      administration of blood-plasma from patients recovered from COVID-19, could be effective to
      treat patients who are severely ill because of a COVID-19 infection. The general idea behind
      the transfusion, is that plasma of recovered patients contains antibodies that could
      eliminate the novel coronavirus causing COVID-19, and lead to a less severe course of the
      disease, or a faster healing. Simply put, in this study we would like to investigate whether
      'borrowed immunity' from a person who has cured from this disease, could be applied to cure
      other patients more rapidly.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, a new coronavirus (the SARS-CoV-2 virus) emerged, which spread fast across
      the world, and has led to a pandemic. The disease caused by this virus, called COVID-19, has
      a mild course in a high number of infected people, but is known to have a more severe course
      in some. Currently, there are no successful treatments with a known effect on the course of
      the disease in patients suffering from COVID-19. In this study, we will examine whether
      plasma, a treatment that has been used in human subjects for other diseases (and is known to
      be safe), can be used to influence the course of COVID-19 towards a lower severity.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate clinical efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma for
      COVID-19.

      This clinical trial is an adaptive, randomized, open-label phase II proof-of-concept study to
      investigate the safety and effect of potentially interesting treatments, for the treatment of
      hospitalized adult patients suffering from COVID-19.

      Because an active treatment for COVID-19 is lacking, plasma donation is now being proposed.
      To investigate this effect of plasma, we will compare two groups of patients. One group will
      get standard treatment, plus plasma from a patient recently cured from COVID-19. A second
      group will get standard treatment alone. In this study, 2 patients out of 3 will receive
      plasma, and 1 patient out of 3 will receive standard treatment alone. After the study, we
      will be able to establish whether plasma donation is useful or not.
