It consists of separate scales for assessing state (STAI form Y-A) and trait (STAI form Y-B). Each of the scales includes 20 items, the E scale to assess how subjects feel at the time, the T scale to capture how subjects feel generally.The STAI is intended for self-administration. It can be completed individually or in a group.</description>
