  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center cohort study. 200 subjects with COVID-19will be included
      . Wearable device's physiological parameters and clinical data will be continually collected
      , the investigators aim to explore whether using smart wearable devices is useful to early
      alerting deterioration of COVID-19.

      This is a prospective cohort study. 200 subjects aged 18ï½ž75y with asymptomatic, mild,
      general-type COVID-19 will be recruited. The physiological parameters of wearable devices,
      including heart rate, sleep, blood oxygen saturation, electrocardiogram and exercise records,
      will be continuously collected from the day of admission / isolation to 14 days after
      discharge or out of quarantine. The Department of Respiratory and Critical Care of Peking
      University First Hospital is responsible for this research. All clinical data of patients
      during hospitalization will be collected including demographic characteristics, onset time,
      visit time, hospitalization time, symptoms, physical examination, laboratory examination,
      imaging characteristics, disease severity, treatment and outcome. Primary outcome is the
      deterioration of disease, the correlation analysis between the change of wearable device
      physiological parameters and the deterioration of disease determined by the traditional
      disease evaluation system will be used to find it whether can early alert deterioration of
      COVID-19.

      The study protocol has been approved by the Peking University First Hospital Institutional
      Review Board (IRB) (2020-055). Any protocol modifications will be submitted for the IRB
      review and approval.
