  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical picture of the novel corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) is rapidly
      evolving. Although infections may be mild, up to 25% of all patients admitted to hospital
      require admission to the intensive care unit, and as many as 40% will progress to develop
      severe problems breathing due to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS often
      requires mechanical ventilation, with a 50% risk of mortality. Researchers at the Ottawa
      Hospital Research Institute (OHRI) have been studying the potential therapeutic role of
      mesenchymal stromal/stem cells, or MSCs, for the treatment of ARDS for over a decade. This
      has led to the world's first clinical trial using MSC therapy for patients with severe
      infections (sepsis) which is often associated with ARDS (NCT02421484). This trial
      demonstrated tolerability, and potential signs of efficacy. In addition, the investigators
      have established expertise in producing clinical-grade MSCs and have received approval from
      Health Canada for the use of MSCs in three different clinical studies.

      The investigators propose a Phase 1, open label, dose-escalating and safety trial using a
      3+3+3 design to determine the safety, and maximum feasible tolerated dose of repeated
      delivery of Bone Marrow (BM)-MSCs intravenously. This will take advantage of a limited supply
      of screened BM-MSCs lines which are available now in the GMP facility and will allow to have
      product ready to deliver to the first patient within weeks. The investigators will enroll up
      to 9 patients; each receiving repeated unit doses of BM-MSCs delivered by IV infusion on each
      of 3 consecutive days (24±4 hours apart) according to the following dose-escalation schedule
      (3 patients per dose panel): (i) Panel 1: 25 million cells/unit dose (cumulative dose: 75
      million MSCs), (ii) Panel 2: 50 million cells/unit dose (cumulative dose: 150 million MSCs),
      (iii) Panel 3: up to 90 million cells/unit dose (cumulative dose: up to 270 million MSCs).
