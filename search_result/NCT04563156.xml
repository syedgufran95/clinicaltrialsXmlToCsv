  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infection with covid-19 is associated with respiratory failure, which when related to other
      etiologies can lead to reduced quality of life, physical, cognitive and mental dysfunction.
      There is no knowledge of the possible consequences of severe covid-19 infection.

      Our objective is to describe these repercussions, identifying risk factors and assessing the
      impact of physical training.

      At least 100 patients over 18 years of age who survive severe Covid-19 infection will be
      evaluated. Assessments after 1, 4, 6 and 12 months after hospital discharge. Quality of life,
      dyspnea, activity of daily living, muscle strength, mental and cognitive dysfunction will be
      evaluated, as well as pulmonary function test, cardiopulmonary stress test and chest
      tomography. Return to work, thromboembolic events and mortality up to 12 months will also be
      monitored.

      Hospitalization data will be used to identify factors related to quality of life, fatigue and
      respiratory dysfunction. Predefined risk factors will be evaluated: age, sex, smoking,
      previous comorbidities index, previous clinical frailty, serum C-reactive protein and
      leukocyte / lymphocyte ratio in the first 24 hours of hospitalization, time between onset of
      symptoms and hospitalization, ICU and mechanical ventilation, time on mechanical ventilation,
      compliance corrected by the ideal weight at the start of mechanical ventilation, driving
      pressure, tidal volume corrected by the ideal weight and PEEP (positive end expiratory
      pressure) after 24 hours of intubation in controlled ventilation, tidal volume corrected by
      the ideal weight after 24 hours of spontaneous ventilation, inspiratory muscle training and
      pulmonary rehabilitation after hospital discharge.

      Prospective longitudinal study in which survivors of severe infection with the covid-19 virus
      (need for hospitalization with supplementation of more than 3l / min of oxygen or mechanical
      ventilation) will be evaluated after 1 month, 4 months, 6 months and 1 year after hospital
      discharge through distance or face-to-face assessment.

      Patients will be included according to a convenience sample until 12/31/2020 with follow-up
      until 12/31/2021. The EQ-5D questionnaire will be collected to assess quality of life. For
      other secondary outcomes, the clinical frailty scale, daily life independence scale, MoCA
      cognition questionnaire, hospital anxiety and depression questionnaire (HADS), muscle
      strength measure by the MRC scale, dyspnea measure by the mMRC and BDI scale will be used
      -TDI, 1-minute sit-and-stand test, maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressure measurement.
      Return to work, occurrence of thromboembolic events, occurrence of falls, need for
      re-hospitalization and mortality up to 12 months after admission will also be evaluated.

      After 6 months of discharge, lung volume measurement will be performed by pulmonary function
      test, aerobic capacity by cardiopulmonary exercise test and evaluation of anatomical
      pulmonary sequelae by chest tomography. Patients residing close to the hospital will be
      offered a physical training program carried out by the physiotherapy team with assessment of
      functional response indicators.

      The data obtained in the follow-up will be crossed with data obtained by the Epicov study in
      order to identify risk factors related to dysfunctions.
