  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-PRONE is a multicenter, pragmatic, single-blind, 2-arm, parallel, randomized controlled
      trial seeking to compare the pre-emptive prone positioning (i.e. encouraging patients to
      adopt a prone position before they require mechanical ventilation) to the control arm of
      standard care alone. Randomization will be stratified by site.

    <textblock>
      COVID-PRONE is a multicenter, pragmatic, single-blind, 2-arm, parallel, randomized controlled
      trial. The intervention is not a medication or a medical device. Instead, the intervention is
      instructing patients to lie on their stomach while they are in bed.

      Patients will be randomized to receive either standard-of-care or pre-emptive prone
      positioning while in bed (target &gt; 12 hours per day) plus standard of care. Randomization
      will be stratified by site. Patients randomized to prone positioning will be instructed to i)
      lie on their stomach supported by their arms and a pillow at the level of their shoulders and
      another pillow at the level of the pelvis, ii) immediately thereafter their oxygen saturation
      will be checked, iii) after a two hour period they can reposition to supine (but should be
      educated on the use of prone position and encouraged to adopt prone position as often as
      tolerated while in bed); the 2-hour period will be encouraged four times each day in addition
      to during sleep overnight.

      Since there are limited data on the potential risks and benefits of prone positioning, a
      feasibility analysis will be performed after 30 patients are randomized to identify the rate
      of serious adverse events in the prone group (e.g., rate of pneumonia, death, intubation) and
      to understand the change in oxygenation as a result of prone positioning.
