      This study is 'A Randomized Phase 1 Double Blind Placebo Controlled, Single-Dose,
      Dose-Escalation Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Orally
      Inhaled Aerosolized Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate in Healthy Adult Volunteers.' The primary
      objectives are as follows:

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of AHCQ administered as a single dose by oral
           inhalation in healthy individuals at escalating doses until either the maximum tolerated
           dose (MTD) is identified or 1 mL of a 50 mg/mL solution is administered.

        -  To determine the recommended Phase 2a dose (RP2D).

      Secondary objectives:

      • To characterize pharmacokinetics (PK) of single dose AHCQ in healthy individuals.

      Study Design:

      This is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 1 single-dose dose-escalation
      study to assess the safety, tolerability and PK of oral inhalation of AHCQ in healthy
      participants.

      Escalating single doses of AHCQ will be studied in healthy participants. The study drug will
      be administered by inhalation through the mouth, and participants will be encouraged to
      exhale through the nose. The study drug, AHCQ, will be administered starting at an initial
      dose of 20 mg (Cohort A1, 1 mL of 20 mg/mL AHCQ solution) with a proposed subsequent doses of
      50 mg (Cohort A2, 1 mL of 50 mg/mL AHCQ).

      Number of Participants (Planned):

      Two dose levels are planned to be evaluated. Each cohort will comprise 8 participants (6
      active, 2 placebo). Therefore, 16 participants will initially be planned to be enrolled in
      the study. Additional participants may be enrolled if one or more enrolled participants do
      not complete the study.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 1 single-dose dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability and PK of oral inhalation of AHCQ in healthy participants.
A sentinel dose strategy will be employed and the decision to escalate to the next dose level, or deescalate or stop the study, will be based on review and analysis of all available blinded safety and tolerability data by the Safety Review Committee (SRC), which will make a recommendation to the Sponsor and the Sponsor will inform the PI of the recommendation.</intervention_model_description>

          2. Males or females aged ≥18 years old.

          3. Good general health as determined by no acute illness and no clinically significant
             abnormal findings on medical history, vital signs, laboratory tests, or physical
             examination at screening that, in the opinion of the PI, would interfere with study
             drug administration, jeopardize the safety of the study participant, or impact the
             validity of the study results; participants with stable chronic illness are allowed at
             the discretion of the PI.

          4. An interpretable 12-lead ECG with a corrected QT (QTc) interval ≤450 ms, according to
             Bazett's formula, without evidence of clinically significant abnormal findings.

          5. Normal FEV1/FVC ratio, defined as any value above 0.7 or above the lower 5th
             percentile of normal AND FEV1 &gt;80% of predicted or above the lower 5th percentile of
             normal.

          6. Pulse oximetry 02 saturation ≥95% in room air.

          7. Negative test result for COVID-19 within 7 days of Day 1 AND concurrent with local
             hospital policy:

               -  A nasopharyngeal swab tested with the ID NOW COVID-19 assay (Abbot). OR

               -  A negative RNA-based test result of an oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swab or
                  saliva sample performed according to CLIA/CLEP.

          8. Females of child-bearing potential must be non-pregnant, non-lactating, have a
             negative urine pregnancy test at screening, and agree to use an acceptable form of
             birth control for 200 days after the last administration of the study drug. Females
             are considered of non-childbearing potential if they are postmenopausal (last
             menstrual period at least 1 year before screening) or have been surgically sterilized
             (documented hysterectomy, tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) for at least 6
             months at screening.

          9. Willing to comply with protocol-defined procedures and complete all study visits.

         10. Willing to use the Inhalation System and exhale through the nose.

         11. Adequate venous access in the left or right arm to allow collection of required blood
             samples.

         12. Participant understands and communicates in English.

         13. Serum Potassium level ≥3.5 mEq/L, Serum Magnesium level ≥1.5 mg/dL, and Serum Calcium
             ≥8.5 mg/dL.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any self-reported symptoms of influenza-like or COVID-19-like illness in the 14 days
             preceding the study visit: Fever &gt;101.4 °F, sore throat, nasal congestion, post-nasal
             discharge, shortness of breath, gastrointestinal distress, wheezing, cough, headache,

             inhaled (oral/nasal) drugs in the 2 weeks prior to Day 1. Mild seasonal allergy
             symptoms that have not altered sleep or activity patterns nor required use of

             have suspected COVID-19, defined by that person being ordered to enter isolation for
             that indication by a medical authority. Close contact is defined as being within
             approximately 6 feet of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged (&gt;10 minutes) period of time
             and can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a healthcare waiting
             area or room with a COVID-19 patient OR having direct contact with infectious
             secretions of a COVID-19 patient (e.g., being coughed on), if such contact occurred
             while not wearing the recommended personal protective equipment for that type of
             contact [e.g., gowns, gloves, N95 respirator (or equivalent), eye protection].

         11. Use of any prescription medication (except oral contraceptives) during the 30 days
             prior to study dosing that may affect drug absorption, metabolism and excretion,
             prolong the QTc interval, affect drug efficacy, or increase the risk of adverse
             reactions, unless approved by the Principal Investigator.

         12. Use of any OTC product, herbal product, diet aid, hormone supplement, etc., within 7
