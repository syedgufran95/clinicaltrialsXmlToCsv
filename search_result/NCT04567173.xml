  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol provides access to investigational convalescent plasma for hospitalized
      patients with COVID-19. Following provision of informed consent, patients will be
      administered around 500 mL of convalescent plasma obtained from an individual who has
      recovered from a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study aims to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of anti-SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma as adjunctive therapy in preventing disease
      progression (prevention of ICU admission) among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Safety
      outcomes include serious adverse events judged to be related to convalescent plasma. Other
      information which will be collected includes patient demographics and clinical data which
      includes quick SOFA scores, ventilator-free days, ICU-free days, dialysis-free days and
      28-day mortality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, randomized, non-placebo controlled, open-label, single-center clinical
      trial which will assess the efficacy and safety of anti-SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma given
      from the 3rd to 14th day of illness after the onset of symptoms in preventing ICU admission
      among hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared to standard of care. Consecutive patients with
      COVID-19 admitted to the UP Philippine General Hospital will be offered participation into
      the study. Patients in the intervention group will receive one dose of type-specific
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma (500 mL collected by whole blood donation or standard
      pheresis at the UP-PGH blood bank from a volunteer who recovered from COVID-19). The primary
      safety endpoints include serious adverse events judged to be related to convalescent plasma.
      The study also aims to compare anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and rates, levels, and
      duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs using RT-PCR between the intervention and
      control groups.
