  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are severely ill with COVID-19 may benefit from receiving plasma infusions from
      donors who have recovered from the disease and are proven to no longer be infected. Efforts
      to initiate the collection and infusion of these products to high risk patients have been
      initiated around the world and the FDA has recently provided information about how this could
      be accomplished. As the Jefferson Blood Donor Center already has processes to collect, test
      and process blood, investigators are planning to make efforts to collect plasma for this use
      should it be necessary. The purpose of this study is to describe the process for identifying
      and collecting convalescent plasma from donors previously infected with the virus. The
      research portion on top of this standard blood product collection will the process of
      identification of subjects and processes by which blood products are processed in this
      special population. This protocol does not involve the administration of blood products to
      patients with COVID-19 infection.

    <textblock>
      As described by the FDA on 3/24/2020, convalescent plasma has been used for a variety of
      infectious diseases including Ebola, SARS, MERS and H1N1 flu. Given that there is no current
      medical treatment beyond supportive care for COVID-19, there is a great deal of interest in
      using convalescent plasma for patients with COVID-19. As a first step in this process,
      investigators are proposing to identify donors and collect plasma with antibodies against
      COVID-19. While the intention is to use this for patients in the near future, the purpose of
      this study will be to see if this is feasible and a separate application will be submitted
      related to the treatment of patients with these products.

    <description>The goal of this study is to identify individuals who have previously been infected with COVID-19 and collect plasma from those who meet inclusion criteria for convalescent plasma donation. This protocol will allow for the collection, manufacturing, and storage of convalescent plasma that may be administered to patients with COVID-19 in the near future. In addition, it allows for testing of SARS-COV-2 antibody titers in the plasma that has been collected to inform studies assessing outcomes for patients currently infected with COVID-19 who have received convalescent plasma infusions.</description>
