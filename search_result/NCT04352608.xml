      This study is a randomized, double-blinded, single-center, placebo-controlled phase Ⅰ/Ⅱ
      clinical trial in adults aged 18~59 years. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      immunogenicity and safety of the experimental SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine. The
      experimental vaccine and placebo were both manufactured by Sinovac Research &amp; Development
      Co., Ltd. A total of 744 subjects will be enrolled, with 144 at phase Ⅰ, and 600 at phase Ⅱ.
      Participant will be assigned to receive two doses of experimental vaccine or placebo on the
      schedule of day 0,14 or day 0,28.
