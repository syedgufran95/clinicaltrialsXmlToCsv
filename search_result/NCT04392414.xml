  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical trial aims to study the safety and efficacy of transfusion of COVID-19
      convalescent hyperimmune plasma for the treatment of moderate and severe forms of COVID-19
      disease in comparison with non-convalescent fresh frozen plasma (standard plasma).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of the safety and efficacy of the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (from
      subjects who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2) in the treatment of moderate and severe forms of
      the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Currently, there are no registered drugs for the treatment of the
      SARS-CoV-2 infection in the world. The use of hyperimmune plasma is a well-known method used
      for many decades to treat many dangerous infections. The effectiveness of such a therapy for
      COVID-19 patients has recently been demonstrated in a number of clinical studies in China.
      Therefore, we plan to study the feasibility of administering multiple doses of COVID-19
      convalescent plasma in comparison with standard plasma to moderate and severe patients with
      COVID-19.
