    <textblock>
      This single-center, prospective, open-label, comparator study, blind for central accessor
      evaluates the efficacy, safety of inhalations of low-doses of melphalan in patients with
      pneumonia with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. All patients will receive 0,1 mg of melphalan
      in 7-10 daily inhalations 1 time per day.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It was previously shown that in ultra-low (more than 100 times lower than conventional
      therapeutic) doses inhalations of alkylating drug (melphalan) are effective in severe
      steroid-resistant bronchial asthma, a form of the disease often characterised by neutrophilic
      type of inflammation. The exacerbation frequency reduced after the treatment, steroid-sparing
      effect was shown, morphological signs of bronchial epithelial regeneration were revealed and
      quality of life of asthmatic patients, treated with ultra-low doses of melphalan, improved.
      In preclinical studies and studies with volunteers, it was found that inhalations of
      ultra-low doses of melphalan do not have cytotoxic properties, but have local and systemic
      anti-inflammatory effects and decrease the activation of lymphocytes due to blockade of heavy
      β-chain of the interleukin (IL)-2 surface receptor. In addition, in ultra-low concentrations,
      alkylating agents are able to disrupt the cell signalling through the receptor for tumor
      necrosis factor (TNF), thereby exerting a protective effect from the cytotoxic activity of
      TNF-α, which leads to the anti-inflammatory response.

      Taking into account, that severe cases of COVID are characterised with hyperergic
      inflammatory response (and in some cases even with the development of &quot;cytokine storm&quot;) it
      can be assumed that the inhalation use of low-doses of melphalan due to its anti-inflammatory
      properties can be effective treatment for patients with COVID-associated pneumonia.
