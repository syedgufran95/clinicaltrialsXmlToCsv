  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective case series of patients who self-medicated with Famotidine during coronavirus
      disease 2019 (COVID-19). The study will collect de-identified patient reported outcome
      measures of patients with confirmed COVID-19 who self-medicated with Famotidine at any dose
      during the period of illness. Data will be collected by questionnaire and telephone
      interview.

      Inclusion criteria:

      Age&gt;18; Ability to give written informed consent for study participation; Confirmed diagnosis
      of COVID-19; Use of Famotidine at any dose during period of COVID-19 illness

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Famotidine is a histamine-2 receptor antagonist, widely available over-the-counter, and is
      safely used for suppression of gastric acid production over a wide range of doses from 20mg
      once daily to 160mg four times daily. In computer-based simulations, Famotidine has been
      identified as a potential inhibitor of the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro). In a
      propensity score matched retrospective cohort study a significantly reduced risk for death or
      intubation (adjusted hazard ratio 0.43, 95% confidence interval 0.21-0.88) was identified for
      patients with COVID-19 who were taking Famotidine before or at the point of hospital
      admission. Some individuals have self-medicated with Famotidine while being outpatients with
      COVID-19. This study is aimed at collecting patient reported outcome measures from such
      individuals.
