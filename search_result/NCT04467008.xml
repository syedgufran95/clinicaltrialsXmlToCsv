      This study will evaluate the diagnostic reliability of the Biosynex rapid blood test for
      Covid-19 infection.

      The Covid-19 pandemic requires a reliable diagnosis of affected patients in order to manage
      them in an appropriate manner, in the appropriate departments. Furthermore, the diagnostic
      reference at the time of this study is based on reverse transcription by reaction in
      polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on a nasopharyngeal swab taken. This method has may yield
      false negatives (up to 30% depending on the series) and its lead time is several hours.

      Alternatives are therefore being developed, in particular rapid blood tests. The rapid
      diagnostic test distributed by Biosynex has been evaluated by the National Reference Center
      for Respiratory Infections Viruses as very specific for the detection of IgG + IgM (93%).

      As part of the evaluation of this test, it was used in patients with severe Covid-19 disease,
      requiring hospitalization in critical care in order to be able to establish their reliability
      in a clinical context where many confounding factors may occur, such as lymphopenia or
      systemic inflammation. However, the early diagnosis of this patient population remains
      critical in order to be able to refer them to the appropriate services.
