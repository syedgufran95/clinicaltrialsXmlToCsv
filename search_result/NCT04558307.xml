  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of establishing severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing at a federally-qualified health
      center (FQHC) during a global health crisis to mitigate COVID-19 disparities in
      socioeconomically disadvantaged populations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Accurate and early diagnosis of COVID-19 infections are critical for rapid initiation of
      quarantine interventions to reduce population spread and to provide appropriate medical care
      to reduce related morbidity and mortality during the current pandemic. The purpose of this
      study is to assess the feasibility of establishing a drive-through rapid COVID-19 testing
      site at a federally-qualified health center (FQHC) during a global health crisis to mitigate
      health consequences in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. We also seek to evaluate
      the effectiveness of community-driven communication in increasing access to rapid testing for
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in this population. This will
      inform public health decisions about improving access to testing for SARS-CoV-2 in
      underserved populations, particularly those receiving care in FQHCs or community health
      centers.

      The specific aims of the study are to:

      Aim 1. To determine the feasibility of a community-engaged research partnership to support
      rapid SARS-CoV-2 testing for symptomatic patients of all ages in the underserved population
      during the COVID-19 crisis. A rapid testing strategy (drive-through testing site) at a FQHC
      using Mayo Clinic Laboratory (MCL) diagnostic processing will be piloted.

      Aim 2. To compare the effectiveness of community-driven messaging in increasing uptake of
      rapid SARS-CoV-2 testing compared with usual sources of health information. A simple random
      sample will be drawn of FQHC patients (N=1000, age 18+) with 1:1 randomization of
      communication about COVID-19 and availability of rapid testing from the FQHC versus usual
      sources (control).
