  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus Pathology is frequently associated with both diabetes mellitus and metabolic
      syndrome. In particular, results of observational studies and meta-analyzes configure
      diabetes as one of the main risk factors for the development of complications and unfavorable
      course of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory
      Syndrome), the syndromes caused respectively by SARS- VOC coronavirus and MERS-COV
      coronavirus. The available data confirm this association also in the clinical picture of the
      infection supported by SARS-COV 2 (COVID-19). In the epidemic outbreak that erupted at the
      beginning of 2020 in the Lombardy Region, about two thirds of the patients who died from
      COVID-19 were affected by diabetes mellitus. COVID-19 occurs in 70% of cases with an
      inflammatory pathology of the airways that can be fed by a cytokine storm and result in
      severe respiratory failure (10% cases) and death (5%). At the moment, the mainly involved
      pathophysiological molecular mechanisms are not clearly defined. It has been hypothesized
      that the transmembrane glycoprotein type II CD26, known for the enzyme activity
      Dipeptilpeptidase 4 exerted by its extracellular domain, may play a fundamental role in this
      process. In addition, it is considerably expressed at the parenchyma and lung interstitium
      level and carries out both systemic and paracrine enzymatic activity, modulating the activity
      of various proinflammatory cytokines, growth factors and vasoactive peptides at the level of
      the deep respiratory tract. The pulmonary parenchyma and the interstitium express
      significantly the Dipeptilpeptidase 4 protein, which in the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
      favors the entry of the virus into the cells, thus allowing the virus to replicate within the
      cells and thus spread throughout the cell inside the organism. Dipeptilpeptidase 4 regulates
      the function of bioactive peptides and above all of cytokines, vasoactive peptides and
      chemokines present at the level of the mesothelium, of the deep respiratory tract (alveolar
      epithelium and alveolar bronchus), of endothelial and immune cells triggering the
      inflammatory storm. In line with this evidence, it has been hypothesized that acute
      respiratory disease from Coronavirus may depend on the massive localization of
      Dipeptilpeptidase 4 in lung tissue. Furthermore, the involvement of Dipeptilpeptidase 4 in
      other chronic respiratory diseases has been demonstrated. Starting from these observations we
      hypothesized that the selective blockade of Dipeptilpeptidase 4 can favorably modulate the
      pulmonary inflammatory response in the subject affected by COVID-19. Among the drugs that
      selectively block Dipeptilpeptidase 4, the one with greater affinity precisely for
      Dipeptilpeptidase 4 is Sitagliptin.

      An observational, retrospective-case control, multi-center study is proposed to evaluate any
      effects of Sitagliptin on clinical, laboratory and instrumental parameters in the course of
      hospitalization for COVID-19. The data will be extracted anonymously from the computerized
      medical records commonly used in clinical practice by the centers involved in the study. The
      evaluation will be performed by comparing the parameters of COVID-19 positive diabetic
      patients treated with Sitagliptin with those of a group of COVID-19 positive diabetic
      patients not treated with Sitagliptin. All diabetic subjects treated with Sitagliptin (100 mg
      / day, 50 mg / day or 25 mg / day) and all diabetic subjects not treated with Sitagliptin,
      eligible for inclusion / exclusion criteria, will be included in the analysis.

      The clinical data of patients that will be collected anonymously during hospitalization will
      include: smoking habit, remote medical history aimed at assessing the presence of
      comorbidities (atrial fibrillation, heart failure, hypertension, arterial hypertension,
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, other lung disease, chronic renal failure, decay
      cognitive, Parkinson's disease, autoimmune diseases), pharmacological history (treatment
      introduced during hospitalization for COVID-19, respiratory failure or other complications;
      use of ACE-inhibitors, sartans, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, antiarrhythmics, beta
      blockers, anti-aggregants, anticoagulants, neuroleptics ). Anthropometric parameters
      including blood pressure measurement and BMI will also be collected.

      For all patients, the following data will be collected at the baseline (first data available
      upon entry into the hospitalization regime) and upon discharge:

        -  Clinical picture and symptoms (presence of cough, body temperature, respiratory rate,
           need for ventilatory support, duration of ventilatory support in days, duration of
           oxygen therapy in day, duration of hospitalization in Intensive Care Unit in days, total
           length of stay in days, blood gas parameters, PaO2 / FiO2 ratio, oxygen saturation by
           pulse oximeter)

        -  Routine blood chemistry tests performed in hospitalization (e.g. glycemia, reactive
           protein C, blood count with formula, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood gas analysis,
           LDH, inflammation indices).

        -  Instrumental exams (chest x-ray)

        -  glycated hemoglobin

        -  Serum creatinine and Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (estimated with CKD-EPI)

        -  Presence of specific comorbidities for diabetes

        -  Average daily blood sugar levels (from capillary blood)
