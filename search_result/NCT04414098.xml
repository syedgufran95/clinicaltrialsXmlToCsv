    <textblock>
      The treatment of COVID-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome with ruxolitinib 5 mg orally
      every 12 hours during 14 days would stop the disproportionate inflammatory response, causing
      a reduction in the proportion of patients who show a progression and worsening of the severe
      acute respiratory syndrome.

      Primary Objective

      Evaluate the efficacy of ruxolitinib in the treatment of COVID-19 severe acute respiratory
      syndrome by means of measuring the proportion of patients with clinical worsening (defined by
      a requirement of FIO2 50% and/or mechanical respiratory assistance) during 14 days after the
      commencement of treatment.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. Evaluate the median duration of hospitalization. Median duration after 45 days of
           commencement of treatment.

        2. Evaluate the evolution of systemic inflammation parameters. Evaluation at the beginning
           (baseline), middle and end of the treatment with ruxolitinib of PCR, LDH, ESD, Ferritin
           and IL-6.

        3. Evaluate COVID-19 mortality rate after 45 days of treatment.

        4. Evaluate the proportion of the requirement of mechanical ventilation.

        5. Evaluate ruxolitinib adverse reactions with a total follow-up of 45 days.

        6. Evaluate the proportion of secondary infections during the treatment with ruxolitinib.

    <description>Ruxolitinib 5 mg orally every 12 hours during 14 days.
Total Follow-up time will be of 45 days.
The reduction of ruxolitinib dose will be considered in cases of drug-related cytopenias.
During hospitalization, clinical and laboratory evolution parameters will be recorded daily in the medical history of the patient and in the data collection table of the study. Upon patient's discharge, a follow-up will be conducted until day +45
During hospitalization, adverse events will be monitored daily by means of clinical assessment and laboratory data.
After discharge, monitoring of adverse events will continue during the outpatient follow-up.
Pro-inflammatory parameters will be assessed at baseline, after one week (day +7) and at the end of treatment (day +14)
Ruxolitinib will be associated to the standard of care for COVID-19 of each center.
In case of an adverse effect or a need to discontinue the treatment, ruxolitinib should be suspended.</description>

         12. Any condition that, according to the Investigator, may interfere with the complete
             participation of the patient in the study, including the administration of the
             medicinal product, the limitation of visits, the implication of a risk for the patient
             or that prevents the correct interpretation of the results.

        Study Design

        Experimental, open-label, prospective, single center, add-on (added to the standard
        treatment) study, compared with the historical control arm.

        Control arm: It will include patients with COVID-19 Respiratory Syndrome who meet the
        aforementioned selection criteria and have received the standard of care (SOC). Efforts
        will be made so that both arms share similar demographic characteristics as regards gender
        and age group. Ten centers will participate, which will share the same protocol and their
        results may be jointly analyzed. The expected n per center is 10-15 patients.

        For the safety assessment as part of the objective, the following parameters will be taken
        into account:

          1. Biochemical changes: (day 1, 8 and 14) Leukocytes, Formula, Hemoglobin, platelets,
             creatinine, glycemia, PT, Bilirubin, GOT/GPT.

          2. Grade 3/4 Toxicity, SAE (Serious Adverse Event)

          3. Incidence of discontinuation, suspension or dose-reduction of the study drug.

          4. Incidence of secondary infections.

        Efficacy Assessment:

          1. Efficacy will be graded according to the ordinal scale of 8 points.

          2. Time to Improvement

          3. Time of response consolidation

          4. Changes in NEWS table
