    <textblock>
      A Phase I/II, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, individually randomized trial to assess
      safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the candidate Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine
      ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in adults aged 18-65 years living with and without HIV in South Africa. The
      vaccine or placebo will be administered via an intramuscular injection into the deltoid
      muscle of the non-dominant arm.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 2000 participants will be enrolled into the trial; 1950 HIV-uninfected and 50
      people living with HIV. There will be 4 trial groups, group 1 (n=50; intensive safety &amp;
      immunogenicity cohort, HIV negative), group 2a (n=250; safety, intense immunogenicity &amp;
      efficacy), group 2b (n=1650; safety, immunogenicity &amp; vaccine efficacy) and group 3 (n=50,
      intensive safety &amp; immunogenicity cohort, HIV positive).

      Participants will be followed up for 12 months after enrollment.
