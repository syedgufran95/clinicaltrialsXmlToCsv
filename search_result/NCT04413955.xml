  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic and
      is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The mortality rate for COVID-19
      patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) who require mechanical intubation is
      approximately 75%. While the pathophysiology of severe COVID-19 has yet to be fully
      understood, it is possible that a combination of high viral loads and an overactive
      dysregulated inflammatory response may contribute. Therefore, the clearance of SARS-CoV-2
      virus and cytokines could provide a more opportunistic environment for the innate immune
      system to clear the virus and establish lasting immunity. The Seraph®-100 Microbind® Affinity
      Blood Filter (Seraph®-100) is an extracorporeal broad-spectrum sorbent hemoperfusion filter
      for removing virus and cytokines from the blood. The FDA authorized an Emergency Use
      Authorization (EUA) for treatment of severe COVID-19 with the Seraph®-100. As part of the
      EUA, this registry study will collect de-identified data to assess safety and efficacy on the
      use of Seraph®-100 Microbind® Affinity Blood Filter in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
