  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have suggested a potential clinical benefit of controlling hyper inflammation
      triggered by SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Blood purification, the removal of excessive
      proinflammatory mediators may control disease progression and support clinical recovery.

      For this purpose, COVID-19 patients might benefit from treatment with AN69ST hemofilter based
      extracorporeal blood purification.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 disease progression is associated with dysregulated immunity, commonly referred to
      as cytokine storm, in particular, aberrant Interleukin (IL) 6 levels that promote numerous
      pathological downstream effects. Hyperinflammation is a well-established trigger of
      multiorgan failure, for example, acute kidney injury. Moreover, recent reports point to a
      link between hyper inflammation and COVID-19 induced coagulopathy as a result of increased
      production of clotting factors by the liver.

      Despite several lines of evidence pointing to a potential clinical benefit of controlling
      hyperinflammation triggered by COVID-19, management of COVID-19 remains mostly supportive
      built around continuous respiratory support.

      To this end, considering the underlying immunological character of COVID-19 disease and the
      high risk of SARS-CoV-2 hyperinflammation to trigger ARDS, hypercoagulability and Acute
      Kidney Injury (AKI) this study aims to monitor selected biochemical, immunological and
      coagulation parameters in combination with radiological imaging to guide clinical practice
      and to tailor therapy consisting of 1) early initiation of blood purification using the
      oXiris® (AN69ST) filter, 2) systemic heparinisation and 3) respiratory support

    <intervention_name>Extracorporeal blood purification using the oXiris® (AN69ST) hemofilter</intervention_name>
    <description>Admitted patients will receive at least 1 cycle of extracorporeal blood purification using the oXiris® (AN69ST) hemofilter (Baxter, IL, USA). The number of cycles of blood purification is determined based on multiple biochemical, immunological, coagulation parameters, radiological imaging and overall clinical condition.
The patient is connected to the Prismaflex® oXiris® system via a double lumen catheter placed in the femoral vein or vena subclavia.
Flow rates will be maintained as follow; effluent dose 35 mL/Kg/h, dialysate 14 - 16 mL/Kg/h, blood 150 mL/min, replacement 16 -18 mL/Kg/h; patient fluid removal is tailored to the individual's volume status, ≈ 100 - 250 mL/h.
The oXiris® extracorporeal and organ support modality will be chosen according to the patient's kidney function; continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH), continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) or slow continuous ultrafiltration (SCUF).</description>
