  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In January 2020, the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was identified in China. The disease caused
      by this coronavirus was named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO). Since March
      11, 2020, the WHO has described the global situation of COVID-19 as a pandemic. In Côte
      d'Ivoire, as in other African countries, the number of cases is increasing exponentially.

      Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to
      more severe pathologies. COVID-19 can result in fever or a feeling of fever (chills,
      hot-cold), cough, headache, aches and pains, unusual tiredness, sudden loss of smell, total
      disappearance of taste, or diarrhea. In severe forms, respiratory difficulties can lead to
      hospitalization in intensive care or even death.

      Numerous studies are currently being conducted around the world to seek effective treatment,
      but few of them have started specifically in Africa. Moreover, most of these studies are
      using a single drug to control the infection, whether these are repositioned drugs, i.e.
      already being used for other diseases, or other newer drugs.

      Currently in Côte d'Ivoire, the preferred treatment for COVID-19 is an antiviral:
      lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), usually directed against the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

      Since the number of viruses (viral load) is high in the respiratory tract during COVID-19
      infection, we propose in INTENSE-COV (ICOV) clinical trial to study whether the combination
      of two drugs is more effective than taking a single drug on reducing the viral load in the
      respiratory tract but also on reducing inflammation.

      These drugs include the LPV/r already in use in Côte d'Ivoire as well as an antihypertensive
      drug - telmisartan, and a drug that lowers blood cholesterol - atorvastatin. All three have
      been known for a long time and have been shown to be effective against other viruses. In
      addition, they are generic, inexpensive and readily available in all countries.

      The objectives of the ICOV study are therefore to improve viral eradication from the
      patient's body and respiratory tract, to reduce inflammation, to improve more rapidly the
      patient's state of health and to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus to others.

      To participate in ICOV, patients must be over 18 years of age, have a COVID-19 infection
      confirmed by a specific test, have clinical manifestations of the infection, and have signed
      an informed consent. They will then be randomized into 3 treatment groups to ensure the
      robustness of the study results. The reference group will be treated with LPV/r, according to
      current recommendations in Côte d'Ivoire. The other 2 groups will be treated with LPV/r +
      telmisartan and LPV/r + atorvastatin respectively. The treatment will last 10 days and
      patients will be followed for a total of 28 days.
