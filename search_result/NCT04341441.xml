  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-site study designed to evaluate whether the use of
      hydroxychloroquine in healthcare workers (HCW), Nursing Home Workers (NHW), first responders
      (FR), and Detroit Department of Transportation bus drivers (DDOT) in SE, Michigan, can
      prevent the acquisition, symptoms and clinical COVID-19 infection

      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether the use of daily or weekly oral
      hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) therapy will prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 viremia and
      clinical COVID-19 infection healthcare workers (HCW) and first responders (FR) (EMS, Fire,
      Police, bus drivers) in Southeast Michigan.

      Preventing COVID-19 transmission to HCW, FR, and Detroit Department of Transportation (DDOT)
      bus drivers is a critical step in preserving the health care and first responder force, the
      prevention of COVID-19 transmission in health care facilities, with the potential to preserve
      thousands of lives in addition to sustaining health care systems and civil services both
      nationally and globally. If efficacious, further studies on the use of hydroxychloroquine to
      prevent COVID-19 in the general population could be undertaken, with a potential impact on
      hundreds of thousands of lives.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will randomize a total of 3,000 HCW, NHW, FR and DDOT bus drivers within Henry Ford
      Hospital System, the Detroit COVID Consortium in Southeast, Michigan. The participants will
      be randomized in a 1:1:1 blinded comparison of daily HCQ, weekly HCQ, or placebo. A fourth
      non-randomized comparator group of HCW, NHW, DDOT bus drivers, and FR who are currently on
      standard HCQ therapy will be recruited to assess the impact of weightbased daily dosing of
      HCQ as compared to the randomized arms.

      Eligible participants who are asymptomatic for pre-specified signs and symptoms suggestive of
      COVID-19 infection will have a whole blood specimen obtained at study entry.

      Participants will be provided with weekly dosing of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 400mg po q
      weekly, daily dosing of HCQ 200mg po q daily following a loading dose of 400mg day 1, or
      placebo. Participants will receive monitoring at each study week visit to assess for the
      development of COVID-19 related symptoms, COVID-19 clinical disease, and medication side
      effects. At week 8 or if diagnosed positive, participants will provide additional samples of
      whole blood and complete the final study questionnaire.

      Data including demographic, clinical results, work duties, location of main work area and
      possible exposures in the community will be collected through questionnaires and EMR review.
      Disease-specific, immunologic, and other serologic marker data will be obtained from stored
      samples.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a prospective, multi-site study designed to evaluate whether the use of hydroxychloroquine in healthcare workers (HCW) and first responders (FR) in southeast (SE) Michigan, can prevent the acquisition, symptoms and clinical COVID-19 infection.
The study will randomize a total of 3,000 Healthcare Workers and First Responders, age ≥18 years or older, through the Henry Ford Health System, Detroit COVID Consortium. The participants who meeting study entry criteria and are not on HCQ prior to study enrollment will be randomized in a 1:1:1 blinded comparison of daily or weekly oral hydroxychloroquine versus oral placebo for 8 weeks.
A fourth non-randomized comparator group will be enrolled in the study comprising of HCW who are chronically on HCQ as part of their standard of care for their autoimmune disease(s). This will be an open enrollment group and will provide information of chronic weight-based daily therapy of HCQ effectiveness as a prophylactic/preventive strategy.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>Blinded randomization will be performed by the Henry Ford Hospital Public Health Sciences investigators once the participants are determined to be eligible for enrollment. Randomization will be stratified by study site and risk of exposure based on location of work and type of work.
Once enrolled, each Participant will be assigned a unique identifier (detailed in the full protocol). This number, along with the assigned site number, will constitute the Subject Identifier (Subject ID).</masking_description>

    <measure>To determine if the use of hydroxychloroquine as preventive therapy decreases the rate of acquisition of SARS-CoV 2 infections and clinical COVID-19 disease in Study Participants for each randomized treatment arm as compared to placebo.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure the difference in new cases of COVID-19 disease between randomized treatment arms. Plan statistical analyses will include the assumption that up 10% of HCW at risk will become infected if no prophylactic treatment is provided. Therefore we expect that HCQ treatment arm will provide a reduction in the number of SARS-CoV 2 infections by 30%, with an expected study retention rate of 90%, a sample size of ~1500 participants per group, will have an 80% power to detect the difference at p=0.05.</description>
