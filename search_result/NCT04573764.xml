  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on Chinese studies, cardiac injury occurs in 20-30% of hospitalized patients and
      contributes to 40% of deaths. There are many possible mechanisms of cardiac injury in
      COVID-19 patients and increased myocardial oxygen demand and decreased myocardial oxygen
      supply are likely contributors to increased risk of myocardial infarction and heart failure.
      Interventions reducing the risk of cardiac injury are needed.

      Ketone bodies, such as 3-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, can maintain ATP production in the
      heart and brain during starvation. It has been suggested that ketone bodies are more
      efficient substrates of energy metabolism than glucose, with a lower oxygen consumption per
      ATP-molecule produced. In addition, the reduction in hospitalizations due to heart failure
      observed in type 2 diabetes patients treated with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors,
      is suggested to be partly attributable to increased levels of 3-hydroxybutyrate. Infusion
      with 3-hydroxybutyrate reaching a plasma level of approximately 3 mM had acute beneficial
      hemodynamic effects in patients with heart failure and in healthy controls in a study by
      Nielsen et al. Improved haemodynamics and reduced systemic oxygen consumption might be of
      great benefit in patients with COVID-19.

      The primary endpoint is left ventricular ejection fraction. Secondary endpoints are
      conventional echocardiography parameters, peripheral blood oxygen saturation, venous blood
      oxygen saturation and urine creatinine clearance.

      The study population are twelve hospitalized patients with COVID-19

      The study design is a randomized placebo-controlled double-blinded crossed-over acute
      intervention study.

    <description>The intervention is 3-hydroxybutyrate and will be bought commercially. As an example: One bottle of &quot;H.V.M.N Ketone Ester&quot; with 65 ml contains 25 g 3-hydroxybutyrate of the D-form (the active enantiomer). For more information please refer to: https://hvmn.com/products/ketone-ester. Placebo will be a taste-matched water solution provided by the company. The placebo solution and the active solution will be prepared in identic bottles and investigators will be blinded.</description>
