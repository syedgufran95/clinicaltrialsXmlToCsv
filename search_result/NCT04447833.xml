      This is an open label, dose escalating safety study of the advanced therapy investigational
      medicinal product (ATIMP) KI-MSC-PL-205, where patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2-induced
      severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), according to the Berlin Definition, and
      who are on respirator/ventilator (used synonymously in this protocol) support due to
      respiratory insufficiency with or without concomitant circulatory problems, will be included
      and treated with a single dose of KI-MSC-PL-205.
