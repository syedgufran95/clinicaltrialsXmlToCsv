      A phase I/II single-blinded, randomised, multi-centre study to determine efficacy, safety and
      immunogenicity of the candidate Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in UK
      healthy adult volunteers aged 18-55 years. The vaccine will be administered intramuscularly
      (IM) into the deltoid region of the arm

      There will be 4 study groups and it is anticipated that a total of 1090 volunteers will be
      enrolled. Volunteers will participate in the study for approximately 12 months from last
      vaccination visit (approximately 15 months from enrolment for participants receiving 2 doses)

             blood tests or urinalysis.

          -  Any other significant disease, disorder or finding which may significantly increase
             the risk to the volunteer because of participation in the study, affect the ability of
             the volunteer to participate in the study or impair interpretation of the study data.

          -  History of laboratory confirmed COVID-19.

          -  New onset of fever or a cough or shortness of breath or anosmia/ageusia since February

        Re-vaccination exclusion criteria:

        The following AEs associated with any vaccine, or identified on or before the day of
        vaccination constitute absolute contraindications to further administration of an IMP to
        the volunteer in question. If any of these events occur during the study, the subject will
        not be eligible to receive a booster dose and will be followed up by the clinical team or
        their GP until resolution or stabilisation of the event:

          -  Anaphylactic reaction following administration of vaccine

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Any AE that in the opinion of the Investigator may affect the safety of the
             participant or the interpretation of the study results
