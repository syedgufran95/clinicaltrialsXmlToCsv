      Background:

      COVID-19 is an infection caused by a coronavirus. It can affect different parts of the body.
      For most people, it causes fevers or trouble breathing. Some people can have symptoms long
      after they recover. Researchers want to learn if there are signs of changes in the nervous
      system that may be related to COVID-19.

      Objective:

      To test the nervous system (the brain and nerves) in people who have had COVID-19 yet still
      have certain symptoms even after recovering.

      Eligibility:

      People age 18 and older who had COVID-19 and still have neurologic symptoms after they
      recovered from the initial infection.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a medical record review.

      Participants will have a neurological exam. They will complete pen-and-paper tests of their
      memory and thinking. They will complete a smell test with 'scratch-and-sniff' booklets.

      They will give blood samples.

      Participants will have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. Soft padding or a coil
      will be placed around their head. They will lie on a table that slides in and out of the MRI
      scanner. They will get a contrast dye through an intravenous (IV) catheter.

      Participants blood pressure, blood flow, skin temperature, sweating, and breathing will be
      monitored.

      Participants will have an electrocardiogram to measure heart function.

      Participants will blow into a mouthpiece for several seconds.

      Participants will lie on a table that has a motor. The motor tilts the table. Participants
      will have blood drawn through an IV as the table tilts.

      Participants will have a lumbar puncture. A small needle will be inserted into the spinal
      canal to obtain fluid.

      Participants may repeat some tests 8 weeks to 1 year later.

      Study Description: This study will characterize ongoing neurologic abnormalities in those who
      recovered from acute COVID-19 infection yet have persistent neurologic symptoms. Despite
      clinical recovery from the acute infection, some individuals continue to experience ongoing
      symptoms, at times several months after recovery, and many of these symptoms are neurologic.
      The NIH Clinical Center provides the breadth of expertise and resources to best investigate
      this patient group. This study will collect a broad array of specialized neurologic testing
      in this group who, despite recovering from the acute SARSCoV-2 infection, continue to
      experience neurological symptoms. It is hypothesized that this group will have abnormalities
      on neurologic testing that may identify discrete phenotypes of COVID-19 sequelae.

      Pre-screening for this study will be done under the study, 'Post-Coronavirus Disease 19
      Syndrome at the National Institutes of Health.' Potentially eligible participants will be
      identified under the screening arm of that study and will be referred to the study team. If
      deemed eligible for this study based on a review of available records and a telephone
      discussion with the potential participant, participants may enroll. Enrollment will include a
      visit to the NIH Clinical Center for informed consent and completion of the study procedures.
      We anticipate that the baseline study procedures will take approximately 2-3 outpatient
      visits to complete. Participants may return for a repeat of some study procedures between 8
      weeks and 12 months if there are abnormalities noted on the baseline study procedures.

      Objectives:

      Primary Objective: To investigate structural abnormalities by brain MRI in those with prior
      SARS-CoV-2 infection and persistent neurologic symptoms.

      Secondary objective: To investigate other components of neurologic function in those with
      prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and persistent neurologic symptoms.

      Endpoints: Primary endpoint: The number and character of brain MRI abnormalities on a
      dedicated research MRI protocol optimized to detect COVID-19-associated disease.

      Secondary endpoints: 1. Neurologic examination: The number and character of abnormalities
      associated with both central and peripheral nervous system disease. 2. Autonomic testing: The
      number and character of test results indicating autonomic nervous system or catecholaminergic
      dysfunctions as evidenced by abnormal physiological and neurochemical measures at rest or in
      responses to the Valsalva maneuver or head-up tilting.

      Study Population: This study will enroll 50 participants.

      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants: The NIH Clinical Center will be the
      site of all research studies done under this protocol. All procedures will be completed in
      the outpatient testing areas, including: outpatient clinics, day hospital, phlebotomy, the
      neurologic testing area of 7SW-N, and in Clinical Radiology.

      Study Duration: We anticipate that this study will begin enrollment September 2020 and will
      complete data analysis by December 2022.

      Participant Duration: Participants will complete all required study procedures within an
      approximately two-week time frame. Participants may return for optional follow up with a
      repeat of some study procedures and those participants will complete the study at that point.
