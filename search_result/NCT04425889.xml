      All Healthcare workers (HCW) who had entered contaminated areas at least once and that 14
      days or more had passed from their first entrance to contaminated areas were included. They
      were classified as asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic. A COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test was used
      for antibody detection, and selected participants were subject to real time polymerase chain
      reaction (qPCR) for SARS-CoV-2.
