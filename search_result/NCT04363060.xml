  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The global pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and
      has since spread worldwide.1 As of April 14, 2020, there have been more than 1.5 million
      reported cases and 124 000 deaths in more than 200 countries. A recent open-label
      nonrandomized French study reporte that addition of azithromycin to hydroxychloroquine in 6
      patients resulted in numerically superior viral clearance (6/6, 100%) compared with
      hydroxychloroquine monotherapy (8/14, 57%) or control (2/16, 12.5%). Azithromycin alone has
      never been tested, whereas azithromycin has immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory properties
      that could theoretically prevent or limit secondary worsening. Our hypothesis is that
      azithromycin combined with amoxicillin/clavulanate will be superior to
      amoxicillin/clavulanate alone to obtain viral clearance at Day 6 in COVID-19 patients with
      pneumonia and hospitalized in a non-intensive care unit ward.
