      The goal of the study is to to acquire 18F-αvβ6-BP PET/CT images in patients diagnosed with
      SARS CoV2 and to demonstrate the ability of 18F-αvβ6-BP to detect lung damage.

    <description>Following a 10 mCi (±20%) intravenous injection (IV) of 18F-αvβ6-BP, PET/CT images will be acquired at 60 minutes. Baseline blood samples will be drawn and banked. Vital sign (VS) measurements (heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure and temperature) monitored throughout. Region-of-interest analysis (ROI) will be performed in the lung. Each participant will undergo up to 3 18F- αvβ6-BP PET/CT scans over a 6-month timeframe.</description>
