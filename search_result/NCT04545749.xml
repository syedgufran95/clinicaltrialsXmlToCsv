      This is a phase I, open-label, dose-escalation clinical study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability and immunogenicity of 3 ascending doses of UB-612 COVID-19 vaccine in healthy
      adults. Up to 60 subjects (20 subjects per group) will be enrolled into this study. Subjects
      in each group will be enrolled to receive two doses of UB-612 vaccine at 28-day interval (Day
      0 and Day 28).

    <description>UB-612 is a proprietary high-precision designer S1-RBD-protein based vaccine developed by UBI/UBIA Group. UB-612 also incorporates a Th/CTL epitope peptide pool, selected from the immunologically advantageous M, S2 and N sites on virus, that could bind to human MHC-I and MHC-II to activate T cells.</description>
