  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maraviroc, a C-C Chemokine Receptor 5 (CCR5) antagonist, is well-tolerated without
      significant side effects in its current use in patients with HIV. CCR5 antagonism prior to
      the 'second wave' of inflammatory mediator expression in SARS-CoV-2 may reverse lymphoid
      depletion and may alter cell trafficking of inflammatory cells, both increasing viral control
      capacity and dampening damage to lung tissue, respectively. This study seeks to establish
      whether one week of treatment with Maraviroc, used at its approved dosage for HIV, is safe
      and tolerable in patients with SARS-CoV-2.

          -  Male or female â‰¥ 18 years of age at time of screening

          -  Documentation of a SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis as evidenced by positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR within
             twelve days at time of screening

          -  Chest radiography consistent with multi-focal pneumonia or air-space disease

          -  Written informed consent obtained from subject and ability for subject to comply with
             the requirements of the study.

          -  Subject able to safely swallow pills or receive Maraviroc through a nasogastric or
             orogastric tube.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             neurological, psychiatric, endocrine, or neoplastic diseases that are judged to
             interfere with participation in the study.

          -  Subjects with known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV)

          -  Subjects enrolled in another clinical trial (including one for COVID-19) that excludes
             participation in other trials or includes a potent CYP3A inhibitor or inducer (e.g.
             lopinavir-ritonavir).

          -  Subjects with ESRD or severe renal failure who are taking potent (moderate or strong)
             CYP3A inhibitors or inducers
