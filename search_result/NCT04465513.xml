  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a plus-sense single-stranded
      RNA virus. After an incubation period, which typically lasts for 5-6 days, COVID-19 patients
      present with a mild illness that lasts for a few days. Common symptoms are reminiscent of the
      flu, and include fever, dry cough and dyspnea. A large percentage of patients resolve the
      infection whereas others progress onto adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which
      impedes gas exchange between the alveolar space and the bloodstream and creates the need for
      assisted respiration.The objectives of this randomized, open-label, parallel study is to
      investigate the safety and efficacy of CARDIO plus best standard-of-care in reducing the need
      for mechanical respiratory support, alleviating respiratory symptoms and reducing mortality
      in hospitalized former smoker and steroid-resistant asthma patients with COVID-19 infection.

      SARS-CoV-2, a plus-sense single-stranded RNA virus, is the etiologic agent of COVID-19. After
      an incubation period, which typically lasts for 5-6 days, COVID-19 patients present with a
      mild illness that lasts for a few days. Common symptoms are reminiscent of the flu, and
      include fever, dry cough and dyspnea. A large percentage of patients resolve the infection
      whereas others progress onto adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which impedes gas
      exchange between the alveolar space and the bloodstream and creates the need for assisted
      respiration. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) is an acute respiratory illness of varying
      severity that includes presentation as ARDS with fatal outcomes. AEP pathology results from
      an uncontrolled inflammatory response characterized by excessive recruitment of lung
      eosinophils and production of inflammatory cytokines. Former smokers are at a particularly
      high risk for developing ARDS and constitute a disproportionately higher burden for scarce
      intensive care unit (ICU) beds. At first glance, several studies from China and the US CDC
      show a low smoker prevalence among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. However, parsing of the
      smoker subset for example from the CDC, shows that former smokers actually constitute a
      significantly higher percentage of patients moving from &quot;Hospitalized non-ICU&quot; to
      &quot;Hospitalized ICU&quot; status (73%) as compared to other single underlying condition (44%)
      patients, and a much higher percentage than Current Smokers (22%). Possible explanations for
      former smokers being at much greater risk of ARDS disease progression than current smokers
      include:

        1. The continued presence of nicotine in current smokers and its known anti-inflammatory
           protection

        2. Ongoing smoking down-regulates angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which the
           SARS-CoV-2 uses to invade host cells.

        3. In inflamed airways due to allergy or infection, cigarette smoke significantly
           attenuates inflammatory eosinophilia, eosinophil trafficking and activation of B cells
           in the bronchoalveolar lavage.

      Changes in smoking pattern triggers interstitial injury patterns mediated via recruitment and
      inappropriate persistence of myeloid and other immune cells, including eosinophils,
      especially after cessation of smoking. The adjacent image shows a Computed Tomographic (CT)
      of the lungs of a former smoker 2 weeks after resuming smoking following several years of
      abstinence. It is surprisingly similar in presenting the same bilateral patchy ground-glass
      opacities seen in COVID-19 patients.

      Uncontrolled eosinophil production in lung epithelial cells plays a critical role in the
      destruction of the respiratory epithelium and rapid development of ARDS, particularly in
      former smoker patients. The pulmonary inflammation leads to cardiac impairment and
      intravascular coagulation, kidney insufficiency and liver damage. The scope, intensity and
      rapidity of the host COVID-19 response in former smoker patients strongly advocates for a
      therapeutic strategy that aims to prevent rather than reverse progression from mild to severe
      disease. It is estimated that between 5-10% of asthma patients do not respond to
      steroid-based therapies and require higher doses of medication to achieve control of their
      disease, or have asthma exacerbations, persistent symptoms and airway obstruction despite
      greater medication use. These steroid-resistant asthmatics typically have greater morbidity
      and disproportionately require 50-80% of asthma-related health care costs. Similar to former
      smoker patients, eosinophil presence in the lung is believed to be a major pro-inflammatory
      effector cell in the pathogenesis of asthma. Further, in the United States, chronic lung
      disease (primarily asthma) was the second most prevalent underlying condition in those
      admitted to hospital for COVID-19 infection in adults ages 18-49.

      CARDIO is a safe, natural, salmon oil based, eosinophil effector function (EEF) reducing,
      softgel formulation. Fish oil, inclusive of salmon oil, or marine-derived omega-3 supplements
      have been established as cardioprotective. CARDIO has been studied in human clinical studies
      for the treatment of cardiovascular disease, and as an antioxidant, with an excellent safety
      record. CARDIO has demonstrated therapeutic potential for the treatment of allergic and
      inflammatory conditions, particularly those involving eosinophil effector functions.
      Specifically, CARDIO at 100 ug/ml inhibited eosinophil response to chemoattractant CCL11 in a
      Shape Change assay; inhibited eosinophil response to chemoattractant CCL11 in an integrin
      (CD11b) surface upregulation assay; and significantly enhanced apoptosis, in eosinophils
      sourced from immuno-modulated individuals.

      In vitro and animal dosing studies have been completed for therapeutic dose determination for
      an accelerated Phase 2 trial application. It is hypothesized that CARDIO may reduce morbidity
      and mortality in former smoker patients by protecting respiratory epithelium and alveolar
      pneumocytes from eosinophil-mediated damage. In light of the mechanism of action outlined
      above, it is possible that CARDIO could be used as a therapeutic for COVID-19, particularly
      in former smoker patients with mild illness, with the goal of preventing progression into
      severe disease.

      The population being investigated are hospitalized former smokers or steroid-resistant
      asthmatics diagnosed with mild to moderate respiratory distress due to COVID-19. The former
      smoker definition is from the National Health Interview Survey from the Center for Disease
      Control (CDC). Though the age and BMI have a reasonably wide range to facilitate recruitment,
      the exclusions in place provide the required guidance measures to ensure patient safety and
      address associated comorbidities. Individuals most prone to SARS-CoV-2 and hospitalization as
      a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection are those with co-morbidities such as older age, cancer,
      cardiovascular disease and hypertension, type I or II diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease, obesity and on immunosuppressive treatments. Therefore, participants with the above
      co-morbidities will comprise the population of interest. However, in this context, each
      participant will be assessed on a case-by-case basis by the Qualified Investigator to ensure
      all inclusions and none of the exclusions are met, and that the safety of their participation
      in the study is critically evaluated. The requirement of mild to moderate respiratory disease
      is determined by applying the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) of ≤6, which is indicative
      of not requiring critical care. The NEWS score is a standardized tool developed by the Royal
      College of Physicians to assess disease severity and monitoring of patients in hospital. An
      aggregate score of respiration rate, oxygen saturation, systolic blood pressure, pulse rate,
      level of consciousness and temperature and the score is increased if supplemental oxygen is
      required. The use of these physiological screening tools is relevant to the former smoker and
      steroid-resistant asthma COVID-19 population of interest as this tool addresses signs and
      symptoms of COVID-19. The safety of patients will be assessed at each assessment day, a Data
      and Safety Monitoring Board will be established, and an interim analysis is planned to guide
      safe continuation of the study.

      The objectives of this randomized, open-label, parallel study is to investigate the safety
      and efficacy of CARDIO plus best standard-of-care in reducing the need for mechanical
      respiratory support, alleviating respiratory symptoms and reducing mortality in hospitalized
      former smoker and steroid-resistant asthma patients with COVID-19 infection.
