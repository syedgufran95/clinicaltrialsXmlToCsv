  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to study the use and application of a point-of-care (POC)
      Covid-19 test developed by Spartan BioSciences and recently approved for clinical use by
      Health Canada. Phase I of this study will determine the best route for the swabs (nasal,
      throat, or both), and to determine if this POC test results are comparable to the standard
      core-lab test results.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, testing for COVID-19 is carried out with swabs and blood tests that are sent to
      hospital laboratories for analysis. With the current technology, the turnaround time for test
      results may take any where from 8 hours up to several days for confirmation of whether you
      have COVID-19. This delay in diagnosis may delay care, prevent other testing modalities,
      consume isolation beds and deplete the valuable personal protective equipment (PPE) needed
      while providing treatment for patients with COVID-19.

      Using a new, Health Canada approved technology, we can conduct the virus genetic testing at
      the bedside with a nostril and throat swab, with results in under 45 minutes. This new
      &quot;point-of-care (POC)&quot; technology, if proven accurate, may help future patients receive faster
      and more definitive treatment. At the same time, it might help health care teams to preserve
      resources and optimize care for patients (example: triage use of intensive care or isolation
      unit beds, determine need for PPE, get quarantined staff back to front line to help with care
      if they are non-carriers).
