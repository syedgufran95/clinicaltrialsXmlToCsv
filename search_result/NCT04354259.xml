  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interferon lambda is one of the main arms of the innate antiviral immune response and is
      critical for controlling respiratory viral infections in mice. Interferon lambda has a better
      side effect profile than other interferons because of the limited tissue distribution of its
      receptor. Peginterferon lambda is a long-acting form that has been studied extensively in
      human trials in viral hepatitis, confirming its safety. We propose to evaluate
      peginterferon-lambda in ambulatory and hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study uses an adaptive design with initial enrolment in the Ambulatory cohort (Cohort A)
      followed by a safety assessment before initiation of enrolment in the Hospitalized cohort
      (Cohort B).

      Ambulatory patients (Cohort A) with confirmed COVID-19 deemed well enough for home isolation
      will be randomized to receive a single subcutaneous injection of Peginterferon lambda 180µg
      or saline placebo prior to discharge. Patients will be followed remotely with visits for a
      repeat swab at Day 3 and 7 with the primary endpoint being the proportion positive for
      SARS-CoV-2 on Day 7.

      Safety data will be reviewed by the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee after 50% of the
      Ambulatory cohort (n=60) has been enrolled. If the committee approves study continuation,
      enrolment will continue in the Ambulatory cohort (Cohort A) and will begin in the
      Hospitalized cohort (Cohort B).

      Hospitalized patients (Cohort B) with moderate but not severe COVID-19 will be enrolled and
      randomized to Peginterferon lambda 180µg or saline placebo on Day 0 and 7. The primary
      endpoint will be the time to negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA by nasopharyngeal swab . In addition to
      the primary endpoints on which the study is powered, numerous secondary endpoints will be
      evaluated. Samples will also be collected for ancillary studies to better understand
      predictors of disease severity and response to treatment.

    <description>Peginterferon lambda is a covalent conjugate of human recombinant non-pegylated IFN lambda (IFN L) and a 20-kDa linear PEG chain. Peginterferon lambda Injection is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, ready-to-use solution (0.4 mg/mL) that is clear to opalescent, colorless to pale yellow, and essentially free of particles. Lambda Injection is provided in a 1-mL long Type I glass syringe (0.18 mg/syringe) with a staked 29-gauge, 1/2- inch, thin-walled needle. The syringe has a rigid needle shield and is stoppered with a plunger stopper. Syringes are prefilled with a solution of Peginterferon lambda Injection, mannitol, L-histidine, polysorbate 80, hydrochloric acid, and water for injection; they are intended for a single use at adjustable doses. The syringe is marked with dose indicator lines, which are used as a reference point for administering the correct dose.</description>
