  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary reports have been received from several sources that the periodic inhaling of
      water with a heightened level of kinetic activity has lessened the severity of symptoms in
      Covid-19 infected patients. On at least several occasions, a repeat PCR test performed two
      days after inhaling a particular water-based product was negative. There are no perceived
      advese effects from inhaling the water using a nebulizer or humidifier. It is important,
      however, to validate these preliminary findings and to include other similar products in the
      testing

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several producers of activated water have been in frequent communication with the Principal
      Investigator (PI) over the last decade or longer. They have regularly supplied their water
      products to the PI for laboratory testing, including measuring an activity attributed to the
      absorption of an environmental force, referred to by the PI as KELEA, an abbreviation for
      Kinetic Energy Limiting Electrostatic Attraction. KELEA is regarded as the source of cellular
      energy for the body's alternative cellular energy (ACE) pathway. This pathway can provide a
      non-immunological defense mechanism against infections, presumably including coronaviruses.
      The proposed study is to test water products from several suppliers, as well as a naturally
      available source of KELEA activated water in symptomatic individuals who have tested positive
      by either PCR or antigen testing for Covid-19. The initial mode of administration will be by
      inhalation using a nebulizer or diffuser. Several deep inhalations will be taken on 5
      occasions daily. Prior to the first inhalation and at the end of the second day of
      inhalation, swabs will be taken for Covid-19 PCR and/or antigen testing. The severity of
      symptoms will also be monitored.
