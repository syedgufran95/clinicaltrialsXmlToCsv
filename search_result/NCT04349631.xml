  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hope Biosciences is conducting a research study of an investigational product called
      autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (abbreviated as HB-adMSCs) to provide
      immune support against COVID-19. The study purpose is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      five IV infusions of HB-adMSCs in subjects with no signs of COVID-19.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, Open Label, Single-Center, Clinical Trial to Assess Efficacy of HB-adMSCs
      to Provide Immune Support Against Coronavirus Disease. 75 patients will be enrolled. All
      patients have previously banked their own mesenchymal stem cells at Hope Biosciences.
      Eligible participants are either over 50 years of age, have preexisting conditions, or are at
      high exposure risk of contracting COVID-19. The primary endpoint of this study is to provide
      immune support against COVID-19, measured by the percentage of participants in each category
      of a 7-point ordinal scale and the presence or absence of adverse events and serious adverse
      events related to the study drug. In addition, participants will be monitored for overall
      clinical status by standard clinical laboratories and inflammatory markers. Participants will
      complete Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and depression module (PHQ-9) questionnaires.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must meet the criteria for 1,2, OR 3, AND 4-7 to be eligible.

          1. Men, and women over 65 years of age inclusively (according to CDC provisions) OR

          2. Participant works in healthcare facility or other well characterized high-risk
             environment OR

          3. Has underlying conditions including but not limited to cardiopathies, diabetes
             mellitus, cancer, COPD, asthma or any other systemic autoimmune disease.

          4. Subject must have previously banked their cells at Hope Biosciences

          5. No signs or symptoms of infection, including but not limited to, body temperature &gt;100
             F and pulse rate &gt; 100 BPM.

          6. Subject provides written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures.

          7. Agrees to the collection of venous blood per protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must not have any of the following criteria to be eligible.

          1. Patients who are participating in other clinical trials or have intake of
             investigational drug within the previous 30 days;

          2. Inability to provide informed consent or to comply with test requirements;

          3. Any medical disease or condition that, in the opinion of the site PI or
             sub-investigator, precludes study participation. Including acute, subacute,
             intermittent or chronic medical disease or condition that would place the subject at
             an unacceptable risk of injury, render the subject unable to meet the requirements of
             the protocol, or may interfere with the evaluation of responses or the subject's
             successful completion of this trial.

          4. Patients who have received a stem cell treatment within one year.

          5. Receipt of any other SARS-CoV-2 or other experimental coronavirus vaccine at any time
