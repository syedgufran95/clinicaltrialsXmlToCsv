  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, a highly infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
      emerged in Wuhan, China. On March 11th 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared
      COVID-19 a pandemic. Facing this critical situation, health care workers on the front line
      are at risk of developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms. Physical
      medicine and rehabilitation (PM&amp;R) physicians works both in specialty outpateint/inpatient
      clinic and pandemic outpatient/inpatient clinics during the outbreak. Accordingly, PM&amp;R
      physicians are expected to be mentally affected by COVID-19 pandemic. In this study we aimed
      to evaluate mental health status of PM&amp;R physicians and related factors during COVID-19
      pandemic. This study is a cross-sectional survey which is conducted on an online platform.
      Demographic data, working conditions of PM&amp;R physicians and factors that may be related to
      mental health status is questioned in the survey. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale -
      21 (DASS-21) is used to measure the emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress.The
      Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) is used to assess the severity of both nighttime and daytime
      components of insomnia.
