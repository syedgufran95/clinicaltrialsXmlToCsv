  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical manifestations of Covid-19 are poorly characterised in HIV co-infection, which may
      predispose to more severe disease. Reducing hospitalisation and severe illness in this
      population has important individual and public health benefits. The investigators propose a
      pragmatic multi-centre, randomized controlled trial in South Africa to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to prevent progression of disease and
      hospitalisation amongst HIV-positive people with Covid-19 not requiring hospitalisation at
      initial assessment.

      The trial objective is to compare chloroquine (or hydroxychloroquine) versus standard of care
      for the primary endpoint of hospitalisation or death at 28 days. Consenting adults who meet
      criteria for a Covid-19 person under investigation and who are â‰¥18 years, known to be
      HIV-positive, not requiring immediate hospitalisation and are not at risk of cardiac
      toxicities related to the study drug will be enrolled. The total sample size will be 560
      participants (280 in each arm).

    <description>Chloroquine has in vitro antiviral activity against many viruses, including SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Chloroquine inhibits coronavirus replication at in vitro concentrations that are not cytotoxic and within a range of blood concentrations achievable during standard antimalarial treatment. Chloroquine inhibits viral replication through interference with glycosylation of coronavirus ACE2 receptors, required for viral entry, and downstream phagolysosome alkalisation, interfering with the low-pH-dependent steps of viral fusion and uncoating. Chloroquine also has anti-inflammatory properties and could provide benefit through this mechanism in Covid-19, where a cytokine storm has been described in critically ill patients. Hydroxychloroquine is a less toxic metabolite of chloroquine, has similar anti-inflammatory properties, and is more potent against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.</description>
