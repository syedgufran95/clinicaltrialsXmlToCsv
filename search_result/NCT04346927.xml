  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) erupted in Wuhan (Hubei, China) and
      quickly spread from a single city to the entire country. It did not take long for this
      epidemic to spread to the world. After that, World Health Organization declared this epidemic
      disease as a pandemic. As of now, the number of coronavirus deaths increased to 108,281
      worldwide. Total number of cases approached 1,800,000 according to the latest information.
      While the number of healed patients was highest in China, 77,525 people with COVID-19
      recovered.

      COVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory infectious disease that can cause respiratory,
      physical and psychological dysfunction in patients. Respiratory rehabilitation reduces the
      patient's symptoms of dyspnea, relieves anxiety and depression, reduces the patient's need to
      apply to the hospital, increases functional capacity and improves the patient's quality of
      life. Respiratory rehabilitation, according to the feedback from China, is very important for
      patients in the clinical treatment and recovery process after treatment. Rehabilitation of
      people with mild disease after discharge is mainly based on improving physical fitness and
      psychological adaptation. It is also aimed to gradually restore the individual's ability to
      the activity before the disease and return to the community as soon as possible. Individuals
      with COVID-19 who have respiratory and / or limb dysfunction and chronic disease after
      discharge should receive respiratory rehabilitation therapy. According to the current
      findings of the patients discharged from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and
      Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the clinical experience of patients with Acute
      Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) patients who recovered after discharge, COVID-19
      patients may have physical fitness, dyspnea after activity, and muscle atrophy. (Including
      respiratory muscles and trunk muscles) It is recommended to use respiratory videos and
      booklets as the main method for respiratory rehabilitation in isolated patients at home.
      Telerehabilitation method is also a different recommendation option for rehabilitation.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of exercises performed by
      telerehabilitation in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 followed at home. It is aimed to use
      an innovative model based on the digitally supported, home-based exercise program.

    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a horizontal line, 100 mm in length, and anchored by word descriptors at each end. The VAS dyspnea score uses &quot;no shortness of breath at all&quot; and &quot;maximum shortness of breath&quot; . The patient marks on the line the point that they feel represents the perception of their current state. The distance (mm) between the beginning of the horizontal line and this mark represents the degree of dyspnea perception</description>

    <measure>Modified Borg Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This scale used was a modified Borg scale of perceived exertion adapted to be appropriate for measuring fatigue. This consisted of a vertical scale labelled 0-10, with corresponding verbal expressions of progressively increasing perceived sensation intensity. (0 = no fatigue , 10 = maximal fatigue)</description>

    <measure>Leicester Cough Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) is an English-born self-reporting quality of life measure of chronic cough. It consists of 19 items with a 7 point likert response scale (range from 1 to 7). Each item is developed to assess symptoms during cough and impact of cough on three main domains: physical, psychological and social. Scores are calculated as a mean of each domain and the total score is calculated by adding every domain score. It generally takes about 5 minutes to be completed and it is designed for adults</description>

    <measure>Timed Up and Go</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed Up and Go test (TUG) is a simple test used to assess a person's mobility and requires both static and dynamic balance.
It uses the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down. During the test, the person is expected to wear their regular footwear and use any mobility aids that they would normally require</description>

    <measure>30 Second Chair Stand Test</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 30-s Chair Stand Test consists of standing up and sitting down from a chair as many times as possible within 30 seconds. A standard chair without backrest, but with armrests is used. Initially, the person is seated on the chair with his backs upright. They are told to look forward with their arms folded in their chest and rise at their preferred speed after the command &quot;1, 2, 3, go&quot;. All trials must be carried out using the same chair and similar environmental conditions.</description>

    <measure>The Beck Depression Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a 21-item, self-rated scale that evaluates key symptoms of depression. Individual scale items are scored on a 4-point continuum (0=least, 3=most), with a total summed score range of 0-63. Higher scores indicate greater depressive severity. Two subscales include a cognitive-affective subscale and a somatic-performance subscale</description>

    <measure>The Beck Anxiety Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory that is used for measuring the severity of anxiety in children and adults.The questions used in this measure ask about common symptoms of anxiety . It is designed for individuals who are of 17 years of age or older and takes 5 to 10 minutes to complete. Several studies have found the Beck Anxiety Inventory to be an accurate measure of anxiety symptoms in children and adults</description>
