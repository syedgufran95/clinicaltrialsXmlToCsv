  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the single-centered, retrospective study, 306 hospital patients (including 129 diabetes
      and 177 non-diabetes patients) confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled in Tongji
      Hospital, Wuhan, China. Clinical characteristics including clinical manifestation, laboratory
      parameters, lung CT features and clinical outcomes were compared between diabetes and
      non-diabetes patients. The prediction factors were analyzed for mortality of COVID-19 by
      univariate and multivariate analysis.

    <description>Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed according to the standards of American Diabetes Association which were briefly described as FPG ≥ 7.0 mmol/L (Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 h) or 2-h plasma glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L during Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, a random plasma glucose (RPG) ≥ 11.1 mmol/L. And in this group, we have 129 COVID-19 patients with diabetes.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Non-diabetes</arm_group_label>
    <description>Patients who do not meet the American Diabetes Association's standard diagnosis of diabetes are defined as non-diabetes. And in this group, we have 177 COVID-19 patients without diabetes.</description>

        The patients admitted from Feb 2, 2020 to Feb 15, 2020, diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia
        according to interim guidance of National health commission of the people's republic of
        China were enrolled. Laboratory confirmed cases were identified with positive viral RNA by
        real-time RT-PCR detection by the local health authority or our hospital from specimen
        taken from throat or nasal swab.
