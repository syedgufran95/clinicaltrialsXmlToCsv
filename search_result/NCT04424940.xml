    <textblock>
      Living in Canada and being health-worker in the first line face to COVID-19, investigator
      outcome is to teach an experience or explain the disease using a review and get people
      prepared to COVID-19 treatment focused on adherence to the HIV approved 2006-2007 protocol at
      Ghent University but the review shows an older different study approved at the University of
      Kinshasa and its ethics approval that again is an old document. So no ethics document
      supporting the study exists as it is now and no registration. It is an observational study
      and therefore would not usually require registration in order for the results to be
      published. It is not a type of secondary literature. The formula TOMEKA® (Mix porridge of
      maize, sorghum, and soya) follows FOOD + HEALTH CLAIM. It is scientifically justified,
      relevantly used, and correctly communicated. Methodology: sufficient data? scientific
      consensus? correct methodology? correct population? context: significant results? context of
      use, realistic ingestion? correct target group? communication: consumer perception?
      exaggerated/insinuative, clear, precise, complete, correct information? not misleading?
      correctly presented? The product TOMEKA® tried to fulfill to above questions in a fitting way
      with COVID-19 which is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation without a vaccine.

    <textblock>
      On 12/06/2020 worldwide, COVID-19 affected 7 273 958 confirmed cases with 413 372 deaths, 97
      894 confirmed in Canada with 8 048 deaths, 53 666 confirmed cases in Quebec with 5 148
      deaths, 4 637 confirmed cases with 101 deaths in the Democratic Republic of the Congo where
      the situation is disastrous: an immense country and the ways of communication are difficult
      and damaged. It becomes gymnastics to get a drug package.

      The principal investigator provide the details of this study to be available to the public in
      getting knowledge of Covid-19 and micronutrients using the product TOMEKA®.

      The individual contribution of ingredients in the nutritional composition of TOMEKA® (mixed
      flour). Composition of TOMEKA® (Clinical Research Protocol): 100 g of TOMEKA contain 20.1 g
      of protein; 57.8 g of carbohydrates, 10.1 g of lipids; 8.5 mg iron; 117.6 mg Calcium; 16.6 mg
      Sodium; 55 μg of Selenium and 378.6 kcal of energy.TOMEKA will be made with soy, maize,
      sorghum. The above calculations were made with the food composition table (no laboratory
      analyzes).

      Quantity to be served per meal (in g): 30 g for 6-8 months (113,4 Kcal of Energy per served
      meal). 40 g for 9-11 months (151 Kcal): 50 g for 12-23 months and more expecting to provide
      189 Kcal of energy per served per meal. Each group needs 4-5 meals a day to get the
      equivalent of their daily nutritional needs.

      The study will focus on Selenium, a powerful non-enzymatic antioxidant, more powerful than
      Vit C and Vit E combined. The formula TOMEKA® follows FOOD + HEALTH CLAIM.

      A clear device to follow micronutrients and Covid-19 symptoms:

      Example 1: Vitamin D and Covid-19 (Press release from the National Academy of Medicine in
      France May 22, 2020) Vitamin D is a prohormone synthesized in the dermis under the effect of
      ultraviolet rays, that is to say of the rays of the sun, then transported in the liver and
      the kidney where it is transformed into an active hormone. It is responsible for the
      intestinal absorption of calcium and bone health, but vitamin D also has unconventional
      effects. In particular, it modulates the functioning of the immune system by stimulating
      macrophages and dendritic cells [1,2,3]. It plays a role in regulating and suppressing the
      cytokine inflammatory response which causes acute respiratory distress syndrome which
      characterizes the severe and often lethal forms of Covid-19. A significant correlation
      between low serum vitamin D levels and mortality by Covid-19 has been shown [4]. This
      phenomenon generally follows a North-South gradient, although there are exceptions such as
      the Nordic countries where the supplementation of the nutrients in vitamin D, in particular
      milk products, is systematic. On the other hand, the countries of southern Europe
      surprisingly display a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency despite higher sunshine [5].
      This would explain why children who receive vitamin D regularly have asymptomatic forms of
      Covid-19 and fewer complications. Vitamin D cannot be considered as a preventive or curative
      treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection; but by mitigating the inflammatory storm and its
      consequences, it could be considered as an adjunct to any form of therapy.

      The National Academy of Medicine in France recalls that the administration of vitamin D
      orally is a simple, inexpensive measure and reimbursed by Health Insurance; - confirms its
      recommendation to ensure vitamin D supplementation in the French population in a report in
      2012 [2]; - recommend that the serum vitamin D level (i.e. 25OHD) be measured quickly in
      people over 60 years of age with Covid-19 and that it be administered in the event of a
      deficiency, a loading dose of 50,000 to 100,000 IU which could help limit respiratory
      complications; - recommends providing vitamin D supplementation of 800 to 1,000 IU / day in
      people under the age of 60 as soon as the diagnosis of Covid-19 is confirmed.

      Example 2: Selenium and Covid-19

      Now is the time to give extra attention to a balanced diet and assure an optimum dietary
      micronutrient and vitamin intake! Particularly the micronutrient selenium plays an essential
      role in antioxidant functioning and helps to alleviate the negative health impacts of viral
      infections, including inflammation of the lungs (see e.g. https://lnkd.in/eqAGhDH).

      Particularly elderly people are often selenium-deficient, which was proven to be the case in
      e.g. Italy (see https://lnkd.in/epFKVEY). However, when taking micronutrient and vitamin
      supplements, also follow the instructions to avoid over-supplementation! A healthy and
      balanced diet is the safest way towards an appropriate dietary micronutrient and vitamin
      intake.

      Description of what investigators will measure:

        1. The Production of Medical Knowledge:

        2. Learning medicine:

      How it will be measured:

        1. The Production of Medical Knowledge: Anthropology/Medicine. It is substantial and it
           showed by the title.

        2. Learning medicine: The clinical trial shows that medical anthropology connects
           anthropology and social theory generally with some of the more significant questions of
           our epoch with the COVID-19 pandemic.

      And at what time points it will be measured:

        1. The Production of Medical Knowledge: the principal investigator has received
           notifications from Researchgate about 700 researchers who read his research theme, so it
           deserves to be widely read and taught.

        2. Learning medicine: This is an original trial, which combines theoretical argument with
           empirical observation

      Objectives:

        1. Investigators would like the participant to accept the notion that all knowledge is
           socially and culturally constructed.

        2. Investigators would examine the contexts in which that knowledge is produced talking on
           the theme of nutrition in research and aiming to act in medicine, psychiatry,
           epidemiology, and anthropology.

        3. Investigators would like the participant acts in behavioral medicine, public health,
           epidemiology, anthropology as well as .nutrition.

      The hypothesis of investigators work:

        1. Patients with COVID-19 have an increased demand for Selenium

        2. Selenium supplementation reduces the viral rate

        3. Selenium supplementation improves the BMI of COVID-19 patients

        4. Selenium supplementation reduces COVID-19 related morbidity

        5. Selenium supplementation postponed COVID-19 related mortality

        6. Selenium supplementation is adjuncted to any form of COVID-19 therapy with nutrition
           education

        7. Nutrition education improves health status

        8. Selenium supplementation and nutrition education should be incorporated into the global
           Nutritional care and support of COVID-19 patients

    <citation>The National Academy of Medicine in France recalls that the administration of vitamin D orally is a simple, inexpensive measure and reimbursed by Health Insurance; - confirms its recommendation to ensure vitamin D supplementation in the French population in a report in 2012 [2]; - recommend that the serum vitamin D level (i.e. 25OHD) be measured quickly in people over 60 years of age with Covid-19, and that it be administered in the event of a deficiency , a loading dose of 50,000 to 100,000 IU which could help limit respiratory complications; - recommends providing vitamin D supplementation of 800 to 1,000 IU / day in people under the age of 60 as soon as the diagnosis of Covid-19 is confirmed.</citation>

    <citation>Now is the time to give extra attention to a balanced diet and assure an optimum dietary micronutrient and vitamin intake! Particularly the micronutrient selenium plays an essential role in antioxidant functioning and helps to alleviate negative health impacts of viral infections, including inflammation of the lungs</citation>
  </results_reference>
  <results_reference>
    <citation>Particularly elderly people are often selenium-deficient, which was proven to be the case in e.g. Italy</citation>

    <citation>However, when taking micronutrient and vitamin supplements, also follow the instructions to avoid over-supplementation! A healthy and balanced diet is the safest way towards an appropriate dietary micronutrient and vitamin intake.</citation>

    <citation>Vitamin D is a prohormone synthesized in the dermis under the effect of ultraviolet rays, that is to say of the rays of the sun, then transported in the liver and the kidney where it is transformed into an active hormone. It is responsible for the intestinal absorption of calcium and bone health, but vitamin D also has unconventional effects. In particular, it modulates the functioning of the immune system by stimulating macrophages and dendritic cells.</citation>

    <citation>It plays a role in regulating and suppressing the cytokine inflammatory response which causes acute respiratory distress syndrome which characterizes the severe and often lethal forms of Covid-19. A significant correlation between low serum vitamin D levels and mortality by Covid-19 has been shown.</citation>
