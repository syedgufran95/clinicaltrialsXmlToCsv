  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critical care echocardiography (CCE) has been widely used since the 10 last years. Covid
      outbreak leads that many patients with acute respiratory failure were admitted in the ICU.
      Many of these patients were ventilated and developed ARDS. Some of them developed deep vein
      thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Nothing is already described about the cardiac function
      and the hemodynamics in these patients (how many RV failure, LV systolic dysfunction,...).
      The echo group of the cardiodynamix section of European society of intensive care medicien
      (ESICM) aims to promote CCE and evaluate its interest. The objective is to retrospectively
      enter in an international database all the echo studies done as usual care in these patients
      to evaluate (i) incidence of RV failure, (ii) incidence of LV systolic function, (iii)
      incidence of other patterns. Another objective will be to look for any association between
      some patterns and respiratory strategy, blood gas analysis, systemic hemodynamics. The echo
      studies were done and will be reported following one of the recent systematic review
      published by the same group (Huang S et al. AOIC 2020).

      Multicenter, international observational retrospective study. Patients admitted in the ICU
      between March 1th and april 26th for a pneumonia related to SARS COV 2 and who had at least
      one echocardiography during their stay will be included. Analysis will be retrospective in
      order to report the hemodynamic profile with left ventricular and right ventricular function.
      Will be also reported the respiratory settings, the central venous presure if available as
      well as usual parameters of macrocirculation. All data will be reported in RedCap by the
      University of sydney (https://redcap.sydney.edu.au/).
