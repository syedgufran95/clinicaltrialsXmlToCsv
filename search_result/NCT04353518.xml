    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a randomized, blinded, two arms, placebo controlled, clinical trial to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of Mycobacterium w in combination with standard care as per
      hospital practice to prevent COVID 19 in subjects at risk of getting infected with COVID 19.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately eligible 4000 subjects who are at risk of getting infected with COVID-19 (i.e.
      person living in same household as COVID-19 patients / healthcare workers providing direct
      care to COVID-19 patients) will be enrolled in to the study after due consent and based on
      the eligibility criteria.

      Initially, 400 subjects at risk of getting infected with COVID-19 will be enrolled in the
      study and randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive either Mw (n=200) or placebo (n=200). After the
      interim analysis from the data of these 400 subjects for safety and efficacy and based on
      review and recommendations from DSMB / MC, modification in study design, objective or sample
      size will be considered.

      Study duration for each subject will be of 8 weeks.
