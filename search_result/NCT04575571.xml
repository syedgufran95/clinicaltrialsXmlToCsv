  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The health crisis imposed by COVID-19 is forcing major worldwide social reorganization that
      will have profound consequences on our society. Currently, one-third of the world's
      population (~3 billion individuals) is living under some kind of isolation or quarantine
      measures, causing an unprecedented and rapidly evolving psychosocial crisis.

      The psychosocial consequences of this health crisis will persist long after restriction
      measures are lifted and the pandemic is over. This impact will be significant for individuals
      facing unique contexts or challenges (e.g., older adults, individuals living with a
      disability, underprivileged families) and will most likely exacerbate existing social and
      gender inequalities in health and human development.

      There is an urgent need for information on the evolution of the psychosocial dimensions of
      health and coping strategies used by our population and our health and social services
      structures. Thus, this study is designed to accelerate the availability of high-quality,
      real-time evidence within health and social services structures to address, support and
      minimize psychosocial consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Through constantly evolving
      research questions responsive to the course of the pandemic evolution, the rapid system
      transformations and adaptation of services, and knowledge users (KUs) needs, MAVIPAN aims to
      address, document, monitor, and evaluate the following:

        1. Individuals and families' adjustments and mitigation strategies, especially for those
           considered vulnerable and in high-risk contexts.

        2. Healthcare and social services workers and managers' adjustments and mitigation
           strategies.

        3. The organization of service structures.

        4. The social and economic response.

      To achieve these objectives, we use a mixed methods study design that combines quantitative
      questionnaires and qualitative interviews to deepen our understanding of elements such as the
      coping strategies used during the pandemic. A first measure was taken during lock-down as
      well as a follow-up at 3 months. Another follow-up will be made at 7 months. At least one per
      year follow-up will be made over the course of the study (5 years). Additional measures may
      be taken depending on the evolution of the pandemic and the sanitary measures put in place by
      the authorities.
