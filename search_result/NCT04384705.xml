  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since December 2019, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)
      pandemic has spread around the world. The people most exposed to this virus remain the
      healthcare personnel who are on the front line in the fight against this pandemic. Due to the
      delayed nature of the pandemic in Reunion island and its insular geographical situation, the
      study of the voluntary medical personnel will allow the investigators to establish a
      longitudinal follow-up of the anomalies of the lipidic balance in relation to the exposure to
      the SARS-Cov virus. 2. During bacterial infections, the lipid profiles are profoundly
      modified with very significant reductions in plasma cholesterol levels, LDL-C but especially
      HDL-C whose concentrations are particularly low. Lipid profiles are altered during viral
      infections, for example, the severity of dengue is inversely correlated with total
      cholesterol and LDL-C but not with HDL-C levels, according to a recent meta-analysis. The
      hepatitis C virus circulates in serum linked to lipoproteins rich in triglycerides and HDL
      can facilitate its entry into cells via Scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SRB1). Likewise,
      it has been shown that apoA1 can bind to the dengue virus and increase its infectivity by
      promoting its entry into cells, also via SRB1. At the moment, nothing is known about the
      lipid profiles in subjects with SARS-CoV-2. The investigator hypothesize that a drop in
      plasma HDL-C levels and a change in their size during infection could justify future
      therapeutic approaches aimed at supplementing the subjects most at risk of pulmonary
      complications. In a model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia in mice, investigators have
      shown that the injection of reconstituted HDL allowed to limit the pulmonary inflammation and
      the deleterious consequences of the infection. The investigator propose to study not only the
      lipid profiles in subjects who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 but also the polymorphisms of
      genes involved in the regulation of lipoprotein levels like that of Cholesterol
      Ester-Transfer Protein (CETP) depending on the developed forms, symptomatic or not.
