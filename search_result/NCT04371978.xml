  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging pandemic in 2020 caused by a novel
      coronavirus named SARS-CoV2. Diabetes confers a significant additional risk for COVID-19
      patients. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed
      ubiquitously in many tissues. In addition to its effect on glucose levels, DPP-4 has various
      effects on the immune system and several diseases, including lung diseases. This trial aims
      to assess the safety and efficacy of linagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, in the treatment of
      COVID-19. The trial will be randomized without blinding, with one are treated by insulin only
      for glucose balance and the other by insulin and linagliptin. The trial will assess the
      effects of linagliptin on different measures of COVID-19 recovery.
