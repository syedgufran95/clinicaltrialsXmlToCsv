  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no specific vaccine or treatment to treat critically ill patients with
      COVID-19. Different therapies are still under investigation and are use in different health
      institutions, however, a significant proportion of patients do not respond to these
      treatments, so it is important to seek new treatments. One of these alternatives is the use
      of convalescent plasma. The investigator will use plasma obtained from convalescent
      individuals with proven novel SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, diagnosed with
      coronavirus-19-induced disease and symptom-free for a period of not less than 10 days since
      they recovered from the disease. This plasma will be infused in patients affected by the same
      virus, but who have developed respiratory complications that have not responded favorably to
      usual treatment such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and other antivirals.
      The investigator will evaluate the safety of this procedure by accounting for any adverse
      event.

      There is currently no specific vaccine or treatment to treat critically ill patients with
      COVID-19. Different therapies are still under investigation and are use in different health
      institutions, however, a significant proportion of patients do not respond to these
      treatments, so it is important to seek new treatments. One of these alternatives is the use
      of convalescent plasma.

      The investigator will use plasma obtained from convalescent individuals with proven novel
      SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, diagnosed with coronavirus-19-induced disease and symptom-free
      for a period of not less than 10 days since they recovered from the disease. Donors will be
      screened for infectious diseases including sARS-CoV-2 and will be programmed for apheresis
      the next day. The investigaotr will process one plasmatic volume per donor and this will be
      guarded in the blood bank until required by the principal investigator.

      Patients or receptors will be screened and selected by the research team according to
      eligibility criteria, including severe disease refractory to treatment such as chloroquine,
      hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and other antivirals. Plasma will be fractioned in 250ml.
      Infusion will start after a clinical evaluation and blood sampling. Patients will remain
      under careful observation. If no adverse event is present, infusion will be repeated after 24
      hours and the investigator will evaluate patients again 48 hours after the second
      transfusion. A final evaluation will be performed at day 14. The investigator will evaluate
      the safety of this procedure by accounting for any adverse event.
