  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus COVID-19 is an emerging virus also called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
      Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Eighty percent of patients are poor or asymptomatic. However,
      there are major respiratory complications for some patients, requiring intensive care
      hospitalization and possibly leading to death in 5% of cases. One of the hypotheses put
      forward is that much of the pathophysiology is due to endothelial dysfunction associated with
      disseminated intravascular coagulation.

      The covid-19 pathology could induce coagulation impairment as observed during sepsis. An
      increase in D-dimer levels during covid-19 disease is itself associated with excess
      mortality. While D-dimers are highly sensitive, they are not specific for clotting activity.
      They may be increased in many other circumstances, particularly in inflammation.

      On the other hand, the infection stimulates the release of extracellular vesicles. These
      vesicles, of multiple cellular origin, are an actor of vascular homeostasis, and participate
      in the state of hyperactivation of coagulation. They have a major role in the prothrombotic
      state and the development of coagulopathy associated with sepsis.

      The aim of our monocentric prospective study would be to study early and more specific
      markers of hypercoagulability and markers of routine endothelial dysfunction, as soon as the
      patient is hospitalized, in order to predict the risk of hospitalization in intensive care.
