  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests different messages about vaccinating against COVID-19 once the vaccine
      becomes available. Participants are randomized to 1 of 12 arms, with one control arm and one
      baseline arm. We will compare the reported willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine at 3 and 6
      months of it becoming available between the 10 intervention arms to the 2 control arms.

      Study participants are recruited online by Lucid, which matches census based sampling in
      online recruitment.

    <measure>Intention to get COVID-19 vaccine</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after intervention, in the same survey in which the intervention message is provided</time_frame>
    <description>This is a self reported measure, immediately after the intervention message, of the likelihood of getting a COVID-19 vaccination within 3 months and then 6 months of it becoming available. During analysis, responses among those assigned to different intervention messages will be compared to those in the control group.</description>
