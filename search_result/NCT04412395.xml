      The aim of the study is to clinically use bovine Lf as a safe antiviral adjuvant for
      treatment and to assess the potential in reducing mortality and morbidity rates in COVID-19
      patients. The study was approved by the ethical committee of the Egyptian Center for Research
      and Regenerative Medicine in 11-5-2020.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19) outbreak
      a Public Health Emergency of International Concern with a pandemic spread. The situation is
      rapidly evolving, which raises the approach of reproposing already approved drugs to meet the
      emerging challenge and to save time and money. Lactoferrin (Lf) is a natural glycoprotein
      that broadly distributed within the body fluids and found predominantly in milk. It
      represents a known component of the innate immune system. The antiviral activity of Lf has
      been reported against many viruses, including SARS-CoV-1, through blocking the viral
      receptors on the host cells preventing them from entry and replication. Markedly, data
      reveals that Lf interacts with Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans (HSPGs) and Angiotensin
      Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors that are reported as SARS-CoV-2-binding sites to enter
      the host cell, suggesting a potential significance of Lf as an antiviral against SARS-CoV-2.
      Moreover, the immunoregulatory effects of Lf can protect against the cytokine-storm and
      thrombotic complications that result from the COVID-19-induced over-stimulated inflammatory
      response and exaggerated immune reactions. In addition, Lf can decrease the free iron
      toxicity caused by the virus as it has a strong iron chelating ability. Lf is a safe approved
      food supplement that is available in the markets for enhancement of immunity and for
      treatment of anemia. The aim of this study is to perform a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, two arms, clinical trial to assess oral enteric-coated tablet of bovine
      apolactoferrin (the low iron-content form of Lf) as a safe antiviral and immunoregulatory
      therapy in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 disease.

             patients with inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis).

          -  History or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient state including HIV
             infection, or chronic immunosuppressant medication (more than 14 days) within the past
             3 months (inhaled and topical steroids are allowed).

          -  Patients with severe renal impairment (GFR &lt;60 ml/min/1.73m2 as measured by the
