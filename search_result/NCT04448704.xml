      This study aims to understand the mental health of migrant workers diagnosed with COVID-19 or
      quarantined in dormitories during the COVID-19 pandemic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, there are an estimated 164 million migrant workers. Although studies have
      documented how workers have an increased risk of adverse health outcomes, little is known
      about their vulnerability during a health crisis.

      In the current COVID-19 outbreak, nearly 30,000 migrant workers have been infected with
      SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore. This represents 9 in 10 of the local cases, and 25 dormitories have
      been gazetted to contain the spread of the virus. Correspondingly, these measures have placed
      a spotlight on the well-being of migrant workers.

      In this research protocol, the investigators propose to administer a survey to understand the
      mental health of migrant workers: (1) diagnosed with COVID-19 (housed in NUS or Expo), and
      (2) quarantined in dormitories. This will allow the investigators to capture the base rate of
      depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms in the population, and will also help to identify
      risk factors of psychological distress within this population.
