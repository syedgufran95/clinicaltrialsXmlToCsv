      Whether the perceived changes in management of Acute Severe Ulcerative Colitis during the
      COVID pandemic are widespread, and whether they have any impact on patient outcomes
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the process, evaluation and therapy variation in management of
      ASUC with reference to 2019 British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines and see whether
      there are any differences between ambulatory and hospital management in ASUC. Also to
      evaluate the outcomes in ASUC patients managed during the COVID-19 pandemic
