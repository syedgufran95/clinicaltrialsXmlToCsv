  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Maison des Adolescents (MDA) at Cochin Hospital (Paris) is a multidisciplinary service
      which welcomes adolescents in three different units: consultation, day care and
      hospitalization. However, the epidemic of coronavirus (COVID-19) in March 2020 which imposed
      the extreme limitation of contacts and then the confinement of the entire population,
      required urgent adaptation of care practices. Teleconsultation quickly became essential for
      most consultations (psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, but also pediatricians and somatic
      physicians). In day hospital, daily reception could not be carried out, therapeutic
      workshops, family interviews, or speaking groups were organized remotely. In hospital unit,
      the interruption of visits required the organization of remote interviews with families. Far
      from the comfort of an organized and structured telepsychiatry, the use of videoconferencing
      was done in an emergency and without preparation. The objective is to explore the experience
      of adolescents, doctors and psychologists regarding emergency changes in the methods of their
      follow-up by setting up teleconsultation in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic.

      The study will be monocentric, exploratory, and qualitative based on the Interpretative
      Phenomenological Analysis. 15 adolescents followed in consultation, day hospital or full
      hospitalization and 15 health professionals working at the Maison des Adolescents will be
      included. Semi-structured interviews will be carried out by a psychiatrist, based on flexible
      and evolving interview guides. Qualitative analysis of adolescents and therapists' interviews
      will allow to explore the experience of teleconsultation by each group of participants and to
      inform about the advantages and limits of a teleconsultation device in adolescent care.
