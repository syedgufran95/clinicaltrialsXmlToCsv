      The purpose of the COVIDNOCHE trial (HFNO versus CPAP Helmet Evaluation in COVID-19
      Pneumonia) is to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of standard care non-invasive
      respiratory support (helmet CPAP versus HFNO) for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure from
      COVID-19 pneumonia on ventilator-free days (primary outcome) and other clinical outcomes
      measured up to 90 days.

    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness that can cause acute arterial
      hypoxemia. Treatment with invasive ventilation improves oxygenation yet results in death in
      over 50% of cases. The high incidence of disease has also reduced resources needed to safely
      deliver invasive ventilation including mechanical ventilators and intravenous sedation.
      Non-invasive respiratory support has been shown to be efficacious in acute hypoxemic
      respiratory failure from other etiologies and has the potential to reduce rates of intubation
      and the time spent on mechanical ventilation in COVID-19. However, it is unknown which type
      of support is the most effective, limiting the ability to improve clinical outcomes and
      appropriately allocate resources. To help guide clinical practice and policy, it is critical
      to understand the comparative effectiveness of two forms of non-invasive respiratory support
      used worldwide, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) delivered via a helmet interface
      and high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO).

    <intervention_model>Crossover Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>This will be a randomized study with alternating treatment assignment in which all advanced respiratory units will be assigned to use one of two default interventions (helmet CPAP vs HFNO) as the first-line treatment for refractory hypoxemia (defined as an oxygen saturation (Sp02) of 92% or less on on ≥ 6 LPM (liters per minute) nasal cannula (NC) oxygen). The first-line treatment will be alternated in each unit at 14-day intervals. The initial assignment will be determined by a computer randomization scheme. Patients who are still on their assigned intervention during crossover will remain on that assigned intervention. A design with numerous short periods and frequent crossovers was selected to minimize the risk of changes over time in the patient population and usual care confounding trial results. A 14-day period is also felt to be the minimal time needed to ensure device availability and adherence.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>VFD is the number of days alive and free of mechanical ventilation in the first 28 days after study enrollment. Death before 28 days will be assigned a VFD equal to 0 to penalize non-survival. In cases of repeated intubation and extubation, periods free from invasive ventilation and lasting at least 24 consecutive hours will be calculated and summed. Timing of intubation and extubation will be captured in hours, and the number of hours a patient received invasive ventilation will be used to calculate duration of ventilation.</description>
