  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will aim to investigate the relation of platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume
      (MPV) and platelet distribution width (PDW) with other acute phase reactant c-reactive
      protein(CRP) in Coronavirus(COVID-19).

      As a methodology, patients will be selected in records in one month from the online hospital
      system. Two groups will be divided before as need for mechanical ventilation or not. The
      latter comparison will be about three groups as an ambulatory follow-up, hospital follow-up,
      and intensive care unit follow-up. Parameters will be analyzed according to the groups.

      In this study, as a methodology, patients diagnosed with PCR test through the online system
      created for COVID-19 patients will be included in the study. These patients will be divided
      into 3 groups as outpatient follow-up, hospital follow-up and follow-up with a mechanical
      ventilator in intensive care. In addition, patients who have completed the 14-day treatment
      period, which is considered as the turning point time of the world health organization by
      looking at the patients 3 times, every 5-7 days, which is the accepted incubation period,
      will be included in the study. In these patients, hemoglobin, leukocyte, platelet, MPV, PDW
      and CRP values will be examined for 3 weekly measurements. Changes in COVID-19 disease
      follow-up and treatment of MPV and PDW values, which have not been studied so far, will be
      investigated.
