  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, non-interventional, retrospective study using data captured in the
      EHRs (Electronic Health Records) of the participating hospital sites to determine factors
      that predict disease prognosis and outcomes in COVID-19 patients, specifically:
      Hospitalization/Off-site monitoring, transfer to ICU and/or need for medical mechanical
      ventilation (both invasive and non- invasive), length of ICU stay, and outcome (cure/
      hospital discharge, in-hospital death)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data captured in the EHRs will be collected from all available departments, including
      inpatient hospital, outpatient hospital, emergency room, etc. for virtually all types of
      provided services in each participating site. The study period will be from January 1, 2020
      to the most recent data available.

        -  Primary objective To determine factors that predict disease prognosis and outcomes in
           COVID-19 patients, specifically: Hospitalization/Off-site monitoring, transfer to ICU
           and/or need for medical mechanical ventilation (both invasive and non- invasive), length
           of ICU stay, and outcome (cure/ hospital discharge, in-hospital death)

        -  Secondary objectives

             -  To describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients

             -  To describe the patient management (treatment and procedures) in the target
                population

             -  To describe the outcomes of COVID-19 (discharge, hospitalization, transfer to ICU/
                mechanical medical ventilation, in-hospital death) in relation to patients'
                clinical and demographic characteristics, and treatment received

             -  To determine whether the factors that predict COVID-19 prognosis and outcome also
                apply to other types of pneumonia.

        -  Exploratory objectives One of the goals of this study is to configure the Big Data
           system to unravel any hidden variable/s (and their associations) that may offer novel
           clinical insights into COVID-19 management.

        The study population will consist of all patients with suspected COVID-19 infection, as
        captured in the patients' EHRs of the participating sites.

        Among the suspected COVID-19 cases, we will determine the following:

          -  Confirmed positive cases (i.e., all patients who tested positive for COVID-19 ).

          -  Confirmed negative cases (i.e., all patients who tested negative for COVID-19)

          -  Possible cases (i.e., all patients with suspected COVID-19 but no/pending test
             results) To determine the characteristics of the patients according to their clinical
             outcome, we will study both the confirmed positive cases and all possible classes
