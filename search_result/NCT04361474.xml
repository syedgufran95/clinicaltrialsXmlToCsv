  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The initial symptoms described in the first cases of COVID-19 were mainly fever and
      respiratory signs. Recently, there has been an increase in cases of hyposmia without
      associated nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea. Although we do not yet know the long-term
      consequences of COVID-19 on olfaction, there is evidence in the literature demonstrating that
      post-viral hyposmias are an important source of long-term olfactory disorders, impacting
      quality of life.

      Usually, the treatment of viral hyposmias is based on local and/or general corticosteroid
      treatment combined with saline nasal irrigation at the onset of signs. Because of the
      possible development of severe forms of the SARS-Cov-2 infection, the French Society of
      Otorhinolaryngology has advised against treatment by corticosteroid therapy and nasal
      irrigation. However, as the virus is present in the nasal fossae on average for 20 days,
      persistent hyposmia at 30 days would probably result from an inflammatory or neurological
      damage to the nasal slits or olfactory bulb. Local treatment with corticosteroids could then
      be instituted from 30 days after the onset of symptoms of COVID-19 without risk of
      dissemination.

      In persistent hyposmia other than chronic rhinosinusitis, the only treatment that has proven
      its efficacy is nasal irrigation associated with budesonide and olfactory rehabilitation.
      However, this drug does not have marketing authorisation in France for this indication.
