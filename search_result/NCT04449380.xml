  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pharmacological therapies of proven efficacy in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are still
      lacking.

      Since two clinical stages of COVID-19 are emerging, an early one with typical clinical
      characteristics of a viral infection (fever, malaise, cough) and a later one with pneumonia
      leading to progressive respiratory failure, associated with heavy, cytokine-mediated,
      inflammation, an intervention by a compound possessing both antiviral activity and
      immunomodulatory effects would be most effective at the earliest possible stage.

      The purpose of this clinical trial is to test the efficacy of Interferon-β-1a (IFNβ-1a), in
      COVID-19 patients in an open label, randomized clinical trial.

      The design of the study is to test IFNβ-1a in addition to standard of care compared with
      standard of care alone.

      The primary outcome is the time to negative conversion of Severe Acute Respiratory
      Syndrome-CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) nasopharyngeal swabs.
