  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy based on Adoptive Cellular Transfer (ACT) uses several types of immune cells,
      including dendritic cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, lymphokine-activated killer cells, and NK
      cells. NK cell-based immunotherapies are an attractive approach for treating diseases because
      of their characteristic recognition and killing mechanisms; they are involved in the early
      defense against infectious pathogens and against MHC class-I-negative or -low-expressing
      targets without the requirement for prior immune sensitization of the host and are able to
      lyse target through the release of perforin and granzymes and using antibody-dependent
      cellular cytotoxicity pathways mediated by Fc receptor for IgG (CD16).

      The aim of this project is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of allogeneic NK cells
      from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy donors in patients infected with
      COVID-19 collected by apheresis. This allows us to collect cGMP PBMCs and immunomagnetic
      remove several types of undesirable cells including B, T and CD33+ cells with enrichment of
      NK cells that will be expanded in bioreactors with GMP culture media (AIM-V) supplemented
      with human AB serum and GMP grade IL-2, and IL-15. After quality control verification the
      final NK cell product will be resuspended in 300 mL saline solution for intravenous infusion.
      Initially, we will enroll in this study ten COVID-19 infected adult patients with moderate
      symptoms (NEWS 2 scale score&gt;4). Consent forms will be signed by the patient before the
      therapy. Patients will be treated with three different infusions of NK cells 48 h apart with
      1, 10, and 20 million cells/kg body weight. We will follow the patients for any adverse
      effect, clinical response and immune effects by flow cytometry including markers for NK cells
      expressing different markers (CD158b, NKG2A, and IFN-y). We anticipated that the release of
      IFN-y by exogenous NK cells could attract other immune cell populations to boost the immune
      response against COVID-19.
