  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TACTIC-R is a randomised, parallel arm, open-label platform trial for investigating potential
      treatment for COVID-19 disease. While SARS-CoV infection evades detection by the immune
      system in the first 24 hours of infection, it ultimately produces a massive immune system
      response in the subgroup of people who develop severe complications. Most tissue damage
      following infection with COVID19 appears to be due to a later, exaggerated, host immune
      response. This leads to lung and sometimes multi-organ damage.

      Most people who develop these severe complications still have virus present in their
      respiratory tract at the time-point when the disease starts to evolve. Immune modulation in
      the presence of active infection has potential to cause more harm than benefit. Safety
      considerations when studying immune modulation strategies are paramount. Therefore, this
      study proposes to assess the efficacy of immunomodulatory agents that target dysregulated
      immune response that drive the severe lung, and other organ, damage. The medications
      investigated for efficacy in this trial are Baricitinib and Ravulizumab.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TACTIC-R will assess the efficacy of the immunomodulatory agents Baricitinib and Ravulizumab
      as potential treatments for COVID-19 disease against Standard of Care alone. These agents
      target the dysregulated immune response that drives the severe lung, and other organ, damage
      frequently seen during COVID-19 infection. This trial will compare these immunomodulatory
      agents to Standard of Care over a 14-day treatment period, with follow-up at 28 and 90 days.
      Patients will be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio across treatments.

      TACTIC-R will use a platform design with interim analysis to make efficient decisions about
      efficacy and futility (e.g. lack of efficacy and risk of harm) of the trial treatments. This
      enables the trial to stop recruiting to arms early where a clear efficacy decision can be
      made. It also allows for the addition of further arms.

      TACTIC-R will also iterate an algorithm for use of clinical and biochemical phenotyping to:

        1. Stratify patients to therapeutic arms according to probability of efficacy

        2. Identify early indicators of failure of therapeutic strategy.

      By collecting samples for genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and immunological
      phenotyping, parallel studies associated with TACTIC-R will investigate host susceptibility
      factors for development of severe COVID-19-related disease and predictive biomarkers of
      response to therapeutic strategy.
