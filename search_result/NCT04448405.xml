  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our society is going through an unprecedented situation: the COVID 19 Pandemic is forcing
      many populations, worldwide, into confinement for their own protection. The very
      characteristics of this confinement and of the disease (isolation, potential severity of the
      illness, being psychologically unprepared for such a circumstance) have a significant impact
      on one's psyche, like emotional disorders -anxiety/depression-, difficulties when returning
      to normal life, vicarious traumasâ€¦ Confinement is paradoxical in as although well-intended to
      protect the individual, it leads to the isolation of the individual. This paradox is
      destabilizing one's feelings, because when the investigators feel the need for protection and
      reassurance, the investigators are left alone and feel abandoned. The investigators therefore
      understand that this confinement framework is in essence a situation that might revive
      unresolved deprivation situations from the childhood. How to react in front of this upsurge
      in anxiety? Strategies used may include, among others, escape in the imaginary through
      numerical tools or others, and /or going to the actual characterized by deviant sexual
      behaviours. The investigators know in fact that certain moments, like anxiety, depression,
      boredom, psychological unrest are propicious for acting, for violent sexual offenders. The
      investigators therefore pay extra attention to our patients in such periods favoring these
      kinds of trouble.

      This study will enable us to understand if the confinement associated with COVID 19 has
      generated anxiety that lead sexual offenders or individuals with paraphilic disorders to
      engage into deviant fantasies or, potentially sexual activities.

      The questionnaire is handed only one time to each patient and the questions it contains are
      part of those commonly used.

      How do the investigators precisely operate: self questionnaire on paper, handed to each
      patient followed by the CRIAVS in the waiting room, and returned by the patient to the
      therapist, or the department, in a sealed envelope. Digital data collection thereafter.
