      The primary objective of this study is to screen and identify individuals with flu-like
      symptoms and follow-them up weekly. In the study, baseline data will be collected online and
      then weekly follow up will be done with the participants for 4 weeks via opted communication
      method. There will be no physical contact and we are also avoiding the use of papers so as to
      avoid possible transmission. Participation in this study will be entirely voluntary and the
      questionnaire will be accessible to the participants only when they mark &quot;Agree&quot; on the form.

      The data collection form is available in English and Hindi.
