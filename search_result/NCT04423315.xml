  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Covid-19 mainly affects the respiratory system. Multiple organ dysfunction and a particularly
      progressive respiratory insufficiency along with a widespread coagulopathy presumed to be due
      to infection-associated inflammation and the resulting cytokine storm, are strongly
      associated with high mortality rates. In this study, the association between thrombosis risk
      and clinical presentation of Covid-19 is investigated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The severe acute respiratory distress syndrome related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its
      clinical presentation as Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan,
      Hubei, China in December 2019. It has spread rapidly from its origin in Wuhan City to other
      countries of the world over the last several months.

      Although it mainly affects the respiratory system , multiple organ dysfunction and a
      particularly progressive respiratory insufficiency along with a widespread coagulopathy
      presumed to be due to infection-associated inflammation and the resulting cytokine storm, are
      strongly associated with high mortality rates. SARS-CoV-2 infection may also lead to
      thrombotic disease both in the venous and arterial circulation of patients apart from
      respiratory system due to excessive inflammation, thrombocyte activation, endothelial
      malfunction, and stasis.

      Investigators have reported that both CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores were related to
      mortality in individuals that had stable coronary angina, acute coronary syndrome, Takotsubo
      syndrome or sick sinus syndrome, apart from atrial fibrillation . In addition,
      thrombocyte/lymphocyte (PLT/LYM) and neutrophil/lymphocyte (NEU/LYM) ratios on admission were
      also related with thromboembolic complications in former studies which found them useful to
      predict prognosis of acute pulmonary embolism, as being one of the thromboembolic
      complications of Covid-19.

      Investigators suggest that the parameters mentioned above should also be studied in terms of
      thrombotic complications of Covid-19. Thus they aimed to find out potential associations
      between markers of prothrombotic or inflammatory conditions and some clinical features of
      Covid-19 pneumonia cases on admission and follow-up.
