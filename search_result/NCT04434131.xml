  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label pilot study designed to provide access to treatment with
      investigational convalescent plasma and assess the relationship between NAb titers in the
      investigational convalescent plasma compared to changes in NAb levels in the recipient in
      hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

    <textblock>
      Primary objectives are as follows:

        1. To provide access to treatment with investigational convalescent plasma to inpatients
           with documented COIVD-19 infection

        2. To measure NAb titers in an aliquot of the CP administered, to measure the volume of CP
           administered, and determine whether there is a correlation between the NAb dose (in NAb
           units/kg body weight, where a unit is the reciprocal of the endpoint NAb titer in the CP
           multiplied by the volume in ml) and change or lack of change when comparing
           pre-treatment and day one NAb titers.

      Secondary, exploratory objectives are as follows:

        1. To evaluate the safety of convalescent plasma (CP) administration in hospitalized
           COVID-19 patients

        2. To evaluate viral shedding of SARSCoV-2 in nasopharyngeal or nasal samples before and on
           days 3, 7, and 14 after CP transfusion

        3. To perform genomic analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 from patients before and after treatment
           with CP transfusion

        4. Determine cumulative incidence of disease severity (transfer to ICU, type of respiratory
           support, LOS, and mortality)

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must be 18 years of age or older.

          2. Hospitalized with COVID-19 respiratory symptoms and confirmation via COVID-19
             SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing. If COVID-19 test results are pending or done at enrolment,
             test results must be positive prior to administration of convalescent plasma.

          3. Patient (or legally authorized representative, LAR) is willing and able to provide
             written informed consent and comply with all protocol requirements.

          4. For patients unable to consent, consent by the legally authorized representative (LAR)
             may be obtained by phone.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female subjects with positive pregnancy test or breastfeeding.

          2. Receipt of pooled immunoglobulin in past 30 days.

          3. Contraindication to transfusion or history of prior severe allergic reactions to
             transfused blood products.

          4. On ECMO or in refractory shock at entry
