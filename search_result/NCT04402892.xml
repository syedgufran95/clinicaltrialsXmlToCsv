  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current pandemic caused by the newly identified coronavirus responsible for COVID-19 is a
      major threat to our populations and societies.

      Hypothesis/Objective The acquisition of protective immunity at the level of the individual,
      either through vaccination or natural resolution of the infection, progressively leads at the
      level of the population to the reduction of the fraction of the population that can be
      productively infected and transmit the virus, hence, leading to the diminution of the rate of
      transmission, a phenomenon called herd immunity. Herd immunity was proposed as a strategy to
      control the infection. However, it remains difficult to model group immunity given the
      limited knowledge of the interaction between the host immune system with the virus, whose
      capacity to evolve in face of a neutralizing response is also not known. It is therefore
      important to acquire a better knowledge of the immunological memory that ensures the
      resolution of COVID-19 after SARS-CoV2 infection.

      Method To study single-cell B and T memory cells specific for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 response
      and characterize somatic mutations of immunoglobulin genes and TCR, in hospitalized and
      symptomatic patients and in patients cured of SARS-CoV-2.

    <intervention_model_description>The recruitment of healed patients will be carried out via the Mondor and Bichat hospitals.
After information and obtaining consent at D0 :
the patients will be taken from the departments of the participating centres (35 ml of blood, 5 LITHIUM HEPARINATE tubes).
Inpatients will be drawn from the wards of the participating centres (35 ml of blood, 5 LITHIUM HEPARINATE tubes).
Inpatients will be drawn from the departments of the participating centres (35 ml of blood, 5 LITHIUM HEPARINATE tubes) at D21, then at D90 (3 months) for both groups of patients.
Patients in both groups will be collected from the departments of the participating centres (35 ml of blood, 5 LITHIUM HEPARINATE tubes) at 6 months.</intervention_model_description>
