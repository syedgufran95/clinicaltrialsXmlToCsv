  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The scientific community is in search for novel therapies that can help to face the ongoing
      epidemics of novel Coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) originated in China in December 2019. At present,
      there are no proven interventions to prevent progression of the disease. Some preliminary
      data on SARS pneumonia suggest that inhaled Nitric Oxide (NO) could have beneficial effects
      on SARS-CoV-2 due to the genomic similarities between this two coronaviruses. In this study
      we will test whether inhaled NO therapy prevents progression in patients with mild to
      moderate COVID-19 disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, no targeted therapeutic treatments for the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak have been
      identified. Antiviral combined with adjuvant therapies are currently under investigation. The
      clinical spectrum of the infection is wide, ranging from mild signs of upper respiratory
      tract infection to severe pneumonia and death.

      In the patients who progress, the time period from symptoms onset to development of dyspnea
      is reported to be between 5 to 10 days, and that one to severe respiratory distress syndrome
      from 10 to 14 days. Globally, 15 to 18% of patients deteriorates to the need of mechanical
      ventilation, despite the use of non-invasive ventilatory support in the earliest phases of
      the disease. Probability of progression to end stage disease is unpredictable, with the
      majority of these patients dying from multi-organ failure. Preventing progression in
      spontaneously breathing patients with mild to moderate disease would translate in improved
      morbidity and mortality and in a lower use of limited healthcare resources.

      In 2004, during the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak, a pilot study showed that low dose
      ( max 30 ppm) inhaled NO for 3 days was able to shorten the time of ventilatory support. At
      the same time, NO donor compound S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine increased survival rate in
      an in-vitro model of SARS-CoV infected epithelial cells.Based on the genetic similarities
      between the two viruses, similar effects of NO on SARS-CoV-2 can be hypothesized. While
      further in-vitro testing is recommended, we proposed a randomized clinical trial to test the
      effectiveness of inhaled NO in preventing the progression of SARS-CoV-2 related disease, when
      administered at an early stage.

    <description>The primary outcome will be the reduction in the incidence of patients requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation, as a marker of deterioration from a mild to a severe form of COVID-19. Patients with indication to intubation and mechanical ventilation but concomitant DNI (Do Not Intubate) or not intubated for any other reason external to the clinical judgment of the attending physician will be considered as meeting the criteria for the primary endpoint.</description>
