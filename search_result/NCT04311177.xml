    <measure>Hospital Admission</measure>
    <time_frame>15 days</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome reported as the number of participants per arm admitted to inpatient hospital care due to COVID-19-related disease within 15 days of randomization.
Currently, there is a pre-planned pooled analysis with a national trial network under development.</description>

    <measure>Change in PROMIS Dyspnea Functional Limitations</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Dyspnea (shortness of breath) item banks and pools assess self-reported Functional Limitations, Severity, Activity Motivation, Activity Requirements, Airborne Exposure, Assistant Devices Resources, Characteristics, Emotional Response, Task Avoidance and Time Extension as they related to dyspnea.
In the 33-item Functional Limitations bank, 33 daily activities are rated in terms of degree of difficulty while engaging in the activity over the past 7 days (0 = no difficulty, 1 = a little difficulty, 2 = some difficulty, 3 = much difficulty). Total scores range from 0 to 99, with higher scores reflecting greater functional limitations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in PROMIS Dyspnea Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Dyspnea (shortness of breath) item banks and pools assess self-reported Functional Limitations, Severity, Activity Motivation, Activity Requirements, Airborne Exposure, Assistant Devices Resources, Characteristics, Emotional Response, Task Avoidance and Time Extension as they related to dyspnea.
The 33-item Severity bank assesses the severity of difficulty breathing during various specific activities (the same 33 activities assessed in Dyspnea Functional Limitations). Each activity is rated in terms of degree of dyspnea (0 = no shortness of breath, 1 = mildly short of breath, 2 = moderately short of breath, 3 = severely short of breath) while engaging in the activity over the past 7 days. Total scores range from 0 to 99 with higher scores reflecting greater levels of dyspnea during daily activity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Daily Maximum Temperature</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will report their maximum daily oral temperature to the study team. Outcome is reported as the mean maximum daily body temperature (in degrees Celsius) over 10 days.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Emergency Department/Clinic Presentations</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Severity Rating Day 7</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome reported as the number of participants in each arm who fall into each of 7 categories. Lower scores indicate greater condition severity. The ordinal scale is an assessment of the clinical status at the first assessment of a given study day. The scale is as follows: 1) Death; 2) Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); 3) Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 4) Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 5) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen; 6) Not hospitalized, limitation on activities; 7) Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities.</description>
