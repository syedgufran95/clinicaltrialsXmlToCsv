  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different studies have demonstrated that the absence of companionship during labor and
      childbirth may be responsible for a negative birth experience, an increased risk of postnatal
      depression and/or post traumatic stress disorders. These situation may also have a negative
      impact on mother-child interaction, on marital and family relationship and on the rate of
      maternal suicide in postpartum. However, these previous results cannot be extrapolated in the
      current context where the absence of the companionship is imposed by the confinement
      framework. The objective of the CONFINE study is to assess, for the first time, the birth
      experience of women in the context of limited social support in the immediate post-partum
      period due to confinement, as well as the associated over-risk of mental disorders, compared
      to a post-partum without social restriction.

      The primary objective is to compare, in immediate post-partum, the maternal sense of control
      during childbirth between a group of women who gave birth during confinement (&quot;confinement&quot;
      group) versus a group of women who gave birth after confinement but in the context of
      epidemic (&quot;epidemic&quot; group) versus a group of control women (&quot;control&quot; group; excluding
      confinement and context of epidemic).

      The secondary objectives are:

        1. To compare, at two months post-partum, the maternal sense of control during childbirth
           between the three groups.

        2. To compare, at two months of post-partum, scoring of self-questionnaire Edinburg
           Postnatale Depression Scale (EPDS) for the post-natal depression between the three
           groups.

        3. To compare at two months of post-partum, scoring of self-questionnaire Impact of Event
           Scale - Revised (IES-R) for posttraumatic stress disorder, between the three groups.

        4. To compare, at two months of post-partum, the breastfeeding between the three groups.

        5. To compare, at two months of post-partum, the quality of life (SF-12) between the three
           groups.

        6. To compare the evolution of quality of life at two months of post-partum between the
           three groups.

        7. To compare the rate of post-natal depression between the three groups.
