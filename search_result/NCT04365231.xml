  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to date, and since December 31st 2019, 2 520 522 cases of COVID-19 including 176 786
      deaths, have been reported worldwide. Global efforts are made to save lives and decrease
      morbidity by evaluating therapeutic strategies. Pregnant women with COVID-19 are at high-risk
      of severe complications and mortality from COVID-19 infection, due to physiologic and immune
      changes occurring during pregnancy. These risks include development of maternal hypoxemic
      respiratory failure due to severe pneumonia, hospitalization in intensive care, death; but
      also, fetal morbidity-mortality with chronic and/or acute fetal distress, intrauterine growth
      retardation, intrauterine death and neonatal morbidity, mainly due to induced preterm birth
      and maternal-fetal transmission. Knowledge of these epidemiologic facts on SARS-Cov-2
      infection in pregnant women is currently limited to small case-series. No drug has
      demonstrated solid evidence in treating SARS-Cov-2 virus. Nevertheless, in vitro studies and
      tests in COVID-19 positive patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin merit
      further evaluation. Pregnant women are systematically excluded from drug trials, and
      treatment options for this high-risk population remain untested. The aim of our study is to
      screen pregnant women presenting minor symptoms, for COVID-19 and to evaluate efficacy of
      hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin treatment in preventing aggravation of symptoms with
      development of hypoxemic respiratory failure and complications of pregnancy.
