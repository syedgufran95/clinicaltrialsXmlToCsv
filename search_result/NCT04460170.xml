  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the SARS-CoV-2 infection is relatively new, the long term attributable burden related
      to COVID19 has not been investigated yet. To date, in patients with COVID-19 and their family
      members, there is little information on the functional status, cognitive ability, pattern of
      return to work, and health related quality of life after the ICU admission.

      This study aims to describe the psychological wellbeing, physical - and social functioning of
      COVID-19 ICU survivors and their family members up to 12 months following ICU discharge.

      Study design The COVID-19 Follow up Intensive Care Study (COFICS) is a single center,
      prospective cohort study performed at a University Medical Center in The Netherlands.

      Study population The study population consists of all admitted critically ill COVID-19
      patients with a &gt; 48 hours ICU admission at the ICU of a University Medical Center and a
      family member of the patient. Family members in this study can be partners, other family
      members, or friends who are identified by the patient as important.

      Sample size All consecutive patients admitted to the ICU of the University Hospital for
      respiratory distress due to COVID-19 between March 19th 2020 and September 30th 2020 will be
      enrolled. With consent of the patient, family member(s) of participating patients will be
      enrolled.
