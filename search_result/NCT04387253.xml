  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternal-fetal transmission in the second or third trimester of pregnancy of the SARS-COV-2
      virus could explain some late fetal losses.

      Finding a cause in the context of fetal loss is essential for parents and caregivers. It
      helps to understand the history of the disease, to address the possible risk of a recurrence
      and to plan for future pregnancies.

      If the maternal-fetal transmission of COVID 19 is confirmed and that it is responsible for
      obstetric complications, a preventive action could be proposed to the patients by the
      preconception vaccination.

      The investigators are seeking to clarify the frequency of this transmission is information
      awaited by caregivers, women, couples in particular when the latter are in distress from late
      fetal loss.
