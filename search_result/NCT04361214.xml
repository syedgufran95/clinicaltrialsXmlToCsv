  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the tolerability of high dose of leflunomide in patients with
      COVID-19 who are not yet hospitalized, but have risk factors for disease progression and
      complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single are and single-center tolerability study of high dose leflunomide therapy in
      outpatient adult participants with mild COVID-19. In vitro studies have shown antiviral
      effects of leflunomide against SARS CoV-2, but the clinical outcomes in the disease have been
      variable. Our hypothesis is that targeting high risk patients earlier in the disease course
      and with a higher dose regimen are both required to see improvement in disease outcome
      measures in COVID-19. This study aims to prove the tolerability of high dose leflunomide in
      this setting.

      Patients are selected based on identification of risk factors associated with more severe
      disease outcomes. Investigators will enroll twenty patients and perform a detailed
      Tele-helath interview to ensure they meet eligibility criteria and provide informed consent.
      100 mg leflunomide daily for three days followed by 30 mg day will be prescribed. The
      subjects will be required to monitor their temperatures twice daily and a daily telephone
      call with an investigatory will review symptoms of disease and potential side effects of the
      drug. Subjects can discontinue the drug after five days if they no longer have fever, or take
      the drug for up to ten days if required for fever resolution.
