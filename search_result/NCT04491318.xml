  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. The recurrence of hemarthrosis in patients with congenital coagulopathies favors
      the development of a progressive, degenerative and intra-articular lesion (hemophilic
      arthropathy) that mainly affects the knees, ankles and elbows. Pain is one of the main
      clinical manifestations of hemophilic arthropathy. As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic,
      the Government of Spain, among others, established a total confinement for two months, in
      order to avoid contagion of the population Objective. To assess the effect of COVID-19
      confinement on bleeding frequency, pain perception, and range of motion in patients with
      hemophilic arthropathy.

      Study design. Prospective observational study. Method. 27 patients with hemophilia A and B
      will be included in this study. Patients will be recruited from the Spanish Hemophilia
      Federation (Fishemo) specialized center for hemophilia patients. The dependent variables will
      be: the frequency of bleeding (through a self-report), the perception of pain (measured with
      the visual analog scale and a pressure algometer), the joint state (with the Hemophilia Joint
      Health Score), and the range of joint movement (measured with a goniometer). Two evaluations
      will be carried out: pre-treatment (carried out in the month of February, as a periodic
      evaluation) and post-treatment (at the end of the period of confinement in Spain).

      Expected results. The aim is to observe the sequelae caused by confinement and a sedentary
      lifestyle in patients with hemophilic arthropathy, through changes in joint status, pain and
      range of motion.

    <description>The frequency of joint bleeding was assessed using a self-assessment log provided to patients at the beginning of confinement electronically. This registry included a monthly calendar where the patients included the date, symptoms and location of the hemarthrosis.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline joint health after confinement period</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening visit, within the first seven days after confinement</time_frame>
    <description>Joint status was assessed with the Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS) version 2.1. This tool, specific for hemophilia patients, evaluates joint deterioration in the ankle, knee and elbow joints. This scale measures 8 items: swelling, duration of swelling, atrophy and muscle strength, crepitus, mobility and joint pain. The scoring range for this additive scale is 0-20 points at each joint.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline joint pain after confinement period</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening visit, within the first seven days after confinement</time_frame>
    <description>Joint pain perception was measured with the visual analog scale. This scale has shown moderate reliability. The scoring range is from 0 to 10 points (from no pain to maximum perceived pain).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline range of motion after confinement period</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening visit, within the first seven days after confinement</time_frame>
    <description>Range of motion was measured with a goniometer to assess flexion and extension of the elbow, knee, and ankle joints. This measuring instrument has shown good intra and inter-observer reliability in the joints evaluated. The measurement protocols described by Cleffken, Green and Gerhardt were used to measure mobility in the elbow, knee and ankle joints, respectively.</description>

    <description>The pressure algometer measures the pressure, bilaterally, at which the patient perceives pressure pain on the evaluation point, as the pressure increases at a speed of approximately 50kPa / s. The unit of measurement is in Newton / cm2. The perception of joint pain in the elbow was measured on the lateral epicondyle, in the knee at a distance of 3 cm from the midpoint of the internal edge of the patella, and in the ankle it was measured in the ventral region of the lateral malleolus.</description>
