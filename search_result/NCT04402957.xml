      To evaluate the proportion of subjects alive and free of respiratory failure (e.g. need for
      non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, high flow oxygen, or ECMO) and free of the
      need for continued renal replacement therapy (RRT) on Day 28. The need for continued RRT at
      Day 28 will be defined as either dialysis in the past 3 days (Day 26, 27, or 28) or an eGFR
      on Day 28 &lt;10 mL/min/1.73 m2.

      This is a global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof of concept
      study of LSALT peptide as prevention of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute
      kidney injury in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Following screening and after
      establishing baseline parameters such as lung and renal function, clinical chemistries,
      coagulation, hematology, and urinalysis, and satisfying all inclusion and exclusion criteria,
      patients will be randomized to one of two blinded treatment regimens:

        1. 100 mL of 5 mg IV LSALT peptide infusion over 2 hours daily

        2. 100 mL drug-free IV saline infusion over 2 hours daily.

      Thirty (30) patients will be randomized to active drug (LSALT peptide) and 30 patients will
      be randomized to matching placebo. Patients and, if necessary, the Legal Authorized
      Representative (LAR), the Investigational Staff, and the Sponsor and its representatives will
      not know the randomization schemata. The Pharmacist at the site will be unblinded and prepare
      drug/placebo for injection.

      The study will have staggered enrolment in that a cohort of 6 patients will be enrolled into
      the study during the first wave. Further cohorts of 6 patients will be enrolled only after
      the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB; refer to the DSMB Charter) has assessed the
      adequacy of treatment based upon clinical data of the patient, target drug concentrations,
      and data obtained from the AB001 PK study in healthy subjects to offer recommendations to the
      Sponsor. In the absence of adverse events or any safety issues during the course of study,
      the DSMB may recommend additional cohorts of 6 patients to be studied as planned in this
      protocol. At no time will patients be dosed for more than 14 days of therapy. The DSMB
      Charter will outline all processes for changes to the protocol and protocol design prior to
      the first patient being enrolled into study.

      Patients will be physically examined throughout the study period, including respiratory
      assessments. Vital signs, adverse events (AE), routine blood chemistries, coagulation,
      hematology, and urinalysis will be assessed throughout the study. LSALT peptide and
      metabolite concentrations and cytokine levels will be assessed daily at the mid-point (1
      hour) and immediately at the end of the 2-hour study drug infusion. An ECG will be recorded
      at Baseline prior to drug therapy, Day 3, and at EOS. A chest x-ray will be obtained at
      Baseline and Day 3 as well as at time of clinical improvement, EOT, and EOS. Questionnaires
      (APACHE II, Berlin Definition, SOFA, and modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale)
      will be assessed each morning and when indicated by the PI.

      Duration of therapy will be a maximum of 14 days. Patients will be maintained on the standard
      of care for the treatment of COVID-19 as defined by the institutional guidelines.
      Co-morbidities and concomitant medications will be reviewed daily and documented in the
      patient's eCRF. The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), a potential consequence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, will be assessed daily and prophylaxis will be included as standard of
      care for every patient. Please refer to antithrombotic therapy in patients with COVID-19
      (COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel, 12-May-2020).

    <description>LSALT, a peptide drug with the sequence NH3-LSALTPSPSWLKYKAL-COOH, binds to dipeptidase-1 (DPEP-1) but does not inhibit its biologic enzymatic activity, potentially minimizing off-target or other adverse effects. LSALT peptide inhibits leukocyte recruitment in multiple experimental disease models through the direct inhibition of leukocyte adhesion to DPEP-1 present in lungs, kidney, and liver. DPEP-1 represents a new molecular pathway for leukocyte adhesion discovered by Arch Biopartners scientists.</description>

             consent.

          2. Clinical and laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Patients must be positive for
             the SARS-CoV-2 by Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR

             Diagnostic Panel as well as two of the following three symptoms:

               -  Fever (oral temperature â‰¥ 100.4 Â°F [&gt; 38 Â°C]) with or without chills

               -  Dyspnea or difficulty breathing (â‰¤ 2 on mMRC dyspnea scale)

               -  Nonproductive cough

          3. Patients must present with moderate to severe illness as defined below:

               -  Moderate illness: Patients who have evidence of lower respiratory disease by
                  clinical assessment or imaging and an oxygen saturation (SpO2) &gt; 93% on room air
                  at sea level

               -  Severe illness: Patients who have a respiratory frequency &gt; 30 breaths per minute
                  (bpm), SpO2 â‰¤ 93% on room air at sea level, ratio of arterial partial pressure of
                  oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) &lt; 300, or lung infiltrates &gt;
                  50%.

          4. APACHE II score &lt; 20

          5. Use of hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir, or KaletraÂ®
             (lopinavir/-ritonavir) is allowed if not part of another investigational study.

          6. Sexually active women of child-bearing potential (WCBP) must be using a medically
             acceptable method of birth control throughout the study and for at least 1 day
             following the end of study, and have a negative urine pregnancy test at the Screening
             visit. A WCBP is defined as a female who is biologically capable of becoming pregnant.
             A medically acceptable method of birth control includes intrauterine devices in place
             for at least 3 months, surgical sterilization, or the implant. In patients who are not
             sexually active, abstinence is an acceptable form of birth control and urine will be
             tested per protocol. Women who are of nonchild-bearing potential, i.e.,
             post-menopause, must have this condition captured in their medical history. Pregnant
             women and nursing mothers are excluded from this study.

          7. Patient or LAR is available and willing to give written informed consent, after being
             properly informed of the nature and risks of the study and prior to engaging in any
             study-related procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known sensitivity, allergy, or previous exposure to LSALT peptide.

             to IL-6 inhibitors, TNF inhibitors, anti-IL-1 immunomodulators, and JAK inhibitors
             within five half-lives or 30 days (whichever is longer) prior to randomization and
             throughout the study period.

          4. Anticipated transfer to another hospital or medical center within 72 hours, which is
             not a study site.

          5. Known history of hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HepC), HIV, SARS, or MERS infection.

          6. Participation in another drug or device study at any time during this study, for
             example:

               -  Ulinastatin 200,000 IU or greater

               -  High dose intravenous Vitamin C

             study. Further, female patients who are nursing are excluded from study.

          8. Has any medical condition considered to be clinically significant and could
             potentially affect patient safety or study outcome, including but not limited to:

               -  Acute or chronic kidney disease (stage-4 or -5 renal impairment; eGFR&lt;30
                  mL/min/1.73 m2 or hemodialysis)

               -  End-stage malignancy undergoing treatment

               -  Immunocompromised patients or those with medical/surgical conditions (e.g., solid
                  organ transplantation) which require chronic immunosuppression

               -  Chronic hematologic disease which, in the opinion of the PI, prohibits the
                  patient from entering into study

               -  Acute liver injury with AST and/or ALT levels greater than 3x ULN

               -  History of coagulopathy within the last year as defined by abnormal ACT, aPTT,
