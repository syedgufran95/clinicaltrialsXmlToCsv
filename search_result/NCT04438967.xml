    <textblock>
      This is a nationwide research program to study the neurological effects of COVID-19. It is
      open to the public. Healthy individuals and individuals who are or have been infected with
      COVID-19 are encouraged to join the effort. The study can be done at home with internet
      access and an iPad. Participation take about one hour.

    <textblock>
      Neurological complications have been reported in patients with COVID-19. To better understand
      neurological complications, a group of research hospitals are collaborating to track
      neurological outcomes. We know that COVID-19 can invade our nervous system, but little is
      known about the range of effects that COVID-19 might have on the brain. This study aims to
      gain real-time information about the neurological health of the U.S. population to advance
      knowledge of COVID-19.

      At the conclusion of the study, you will receive non-medical information on your brain
      function as well as study findings and publications made possible by your participation. With
      your permission, Miro Health can also release the results of your assessment to your
      physician. In order for Miro Health to do this, you will be required to confirm your identity
      online, sign a HIPAA agreement to share the information with your physician, and to enter
      your physician's name, email, and contact information. Study duration will depend on the
      development of the COVID-19 pandemic.

      To participate, you must submit a valid email. No other personally identifiable information
      will be gathered at this time.

      To participate, you will:

      Answer online questions Answer a few questions about your health Download the Miro Health app
      from the iTunes store Open the app and complete Miro's interactive tasks (30 mins)

      Advisory: Should you feel that you have symptoms related to COVID-19, contact your healthcare
      provider or local community health office. Miro Health cannot provide healthcare assistance.

    <description>Each participant's Risk Score of mild cognitive impairment will be calculated using machine learning methods on a percent range of 0-100%. Miro Mobile Assessments will measure each individual's functional performance in neurocognitive, neurobehavioral, motor, and emotional domains. Miro Mobile is a clinically-validated iPad application in use by Johns Hopkins and other research centers. Miro Questionnaires will gather each individual's demographic data.

    <description>Miro Questionnaires will gather each individual's demographic and medical history data. Miro Mobile Assessments will measure each individual's CNS functional performance.
From this data, Miro will test the hypothesis that health indicators exist that can predict the likelihood of a COVID-19 infection leading to neurological impairment.
