  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The scientific community is in search for novel therapies that can help to face the ongoing
      epidemics of novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) originated in China in December 2019. At present,
      there are no proven interventions to prevent progression of the disease. Some preliminary
      data on SARS pneumonia suggest that inhaled Nitric Oxide (NO) could have beneficial effects
      on COVID-19 due to the genomic similarities between this two coronaviruses. In this study we
      will test whether inhaled NO therapy prevents progression in patients with mild to moderate
      COVID-19 disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, no targeted therapeutic treatments for the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak have been
      identified. Antiviral combined with adjuvant therapies are currently under investigation. The
      clinical spectrum of the infection is wide, ranging from mild signs of upper respiratory
      tract infection to severe pneumonia and death.

      In the patients who progress, the time period from symptoms onset to development of dyspnea
      is reported to be between 5 to 10 days, and that one to severe respiratory distress syndrome
      from 10 to 14 days. Globally, 15 to 18% of patients deteriorates to the need of mechanical
      ventilation, despite the use of non-invasive ventilatory support in the earliest phases of
      the disease. Probability of progress to end stage disease is unpredictable, with the majority
      of these patients dying from multi-organ failure. Preventing progression in spontaneously
      breathing patients with mild to moderate disease would translate in improved morbility and
      mortality and in a lower use of limited healthcare resources.

      In 2004, during the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak, a pilot study showed that low dose
      ( max 30 ppm) inhaled NO for 3 days was able to shorten the time of ventilatory support. At
      the same time, NO donor compound S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine increased survival rate in
      an in-vitro model of SARS-CoV infected eukaryotic cells.Based on the genetic similarities
      between the two viruses, similar effects of NO on COVID-19 can be hypothesized. While further
      in-vitro testing is recommended, we proposed a randomized clinical trial to test the
      effectiveness of inhaled NO in preventing the progression of COVID-19 related disease, when
      administered at an early stage.

Targeted concentration will have a tidal oscillation between 100 and 300 ppm, in order to maintain an average inhaled concentration from 140 to 180 ppm. The gas will be delivered through a CPAP circuit ensuring an end-expiratory pressure between 2 and 10 cmH2O or trough a non-rebreathing mask without positive end expiratory pressure, depending on the clinical needs of the patient.</description>
