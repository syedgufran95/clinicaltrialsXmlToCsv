  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purposes of this study is to determine the following in participants with mild
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19):

        -  Safety of a single dose of NT-I7

        -  The immunological effects of NT-I7 on peripheral lymphocyte counts in COVID-19 patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multisite, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating, phase 1
      trial of NT-I7 with standard of care (SOC) versus placebo with SOC to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of NT-I7 in adults with mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). After
      determination of eligibility and baseline assessment, a single dose of the study agent (NT-I7
      or placebo) will be administered after 1:1 randomization, along with SOC. Research blood
      collection will occur at baseline, days 3, 7, 14, 30, 60 and 90 days after administration.
      Primary and secondary evaluations will include assessment of adverse events (AEs), absolute
      lymphocyte count (ALC), and trajectory of other lymphocytes subsets: CD4, CD8, natural killer
      (NK), B, and mucosal-associated-invariant T (MAIT) cells. The final study visit will be at
      day 90 after the study agent administration. The investigators hypothesize that NT-I7 is safe
      for administration and preserves lymphocyte homeostasis in patients with mild COVID-19.
