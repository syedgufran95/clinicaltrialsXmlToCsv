  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory study to evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (400 mg BID on D1
      and 400 mg/day on D2 to D7) and azithromycin (500 mg/ 5 days) to treat mild ambulatory
      COVID-19 patients.

      This is an exploratory study to evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (400 mg BID on D1
      and 400 mg/day on D2 to D7) and azithromycin (500 mg/ 5 days) to treat mild ambulatory
      COVID-19 patients.

      We aim to demonstrate decrease in hospital related complications among ambulatory patients
      with mild COVID-19 by treating them with HCQ and AZT on top of standard care compared to
      patients who receive standard care only.

      Ambulatory patients on day 3 of symptoms and with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 will
      receive the treatment.

      Patients that do not fulfill the inclusion/exclusion criteria or that is not willing to
      participate in the study will be invited to consent the use of their data as part of a
      &quot;control&quot; group.
