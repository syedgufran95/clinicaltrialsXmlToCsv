  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present context, it seems necessary to try to describe as precisely as possible the
      physiological alterations due to COVID-19. From these observations, therapeutic proposals
      adapted to this new disease may then be developed, particularly in the symptomatic management
      of the critically ill patient. It therefore seems essential to rigorously study these
      modifications, as they have been studied in the past for ARDS.

      The aim of this non-interventional study is to describe precisely the respiratory and
      hemodynamic changes induced by COVID-19 in mechanically ventilated patients

      .

          -  requiring invasive ventilation,

          -  intubated for less than 72 hours with PaO2/FiO2 ratio &lt; 200 mmHg

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient mechanically ventilated for 72 hours or more

          -  Patient with documented respiratory co-infection

          -  Patient with a contraindication to pulmonary artery catheter insertion: High risk of
