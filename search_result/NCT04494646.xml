  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized Phase 2/3 trial will study
      the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of bardoxolone methyl in approximately 400-440
      patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19. The Phase 2 portion of the trial will include
      approximately 40 patients and is designed to provide an early interim analysis of safety. The
      Phase 3 portion of the trial will include approximately 360-400 additional patients, and is
      designed to determine whether bardoxolone methyl increases the probability of recovery at Day
      29 when compared with matching placebo. Patients will be randomized using permuted block
      randomization in a 1:1 fashion to either once-daily administration of bardoxolone methyl (20
      mg) or matching placebo and treatment will be administered for the duration of
      hospitalization (until recovery), with a maximum treatment duration of 29 days.

      This multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized Phase 2/3 trial will study
      the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of bardoxolone methyl in approximately 400-440
      patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19. Phase 2 has safety as the primary endpoint and
      approximately 40 patients will be enrolled. A pause in enrollment will occur until the DSMB
      performs an initial safety assessment of Phase 2. Phase 3 is designed to determine whether
      bardoxolone methyl increases the probability of recovery at Day 29 compared with matching
      placebo. In phase 3, approximately additional 360-400 patients will be enrolled. Patients
      will be randomized using permuted block randomization in a 1:1 fashion to either once-daily
      administration of bardoxolone methyl (20 mg) or matching placebo. Patients will be stratified
      by study center and invasive mechanical ventilation (i.e., mechanical ventilation with
      endotracheal intubation) use at baseline (yes or no). Enrollment of patients ≥70 years of age
      may be limited (e.g., comprise no more than 10% of all randomized patients), pending safety
      review by the DSMB and executive committee. Treatment will be administered for the duration
      of hospitalization (until recovery), with an expected duration of 10 days. For patients who
      are hospitalized for more than 10 days, treatment can be continued for a maximum treatment
      duration of 29 days. Dose de-escalation (down to 10 mg) is permitted during the study if
      indicated clinically, and subsequent dose re-escalation is also permitted.

      Patients in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 portions of the study will follow the same schedule of
      dosing and study assessments. Following randomization on Day 1, patients will be assessed
      while hospitalized on Days 3, 5, 8, 11, 15, 22, and 29. Assessments will include clinical
      status assessments, vital sign measurements, clinical chemistry collection, and adverse event
      collection. Patients that recover prior to Day 29 will complete an end-of-treatment visit.
      Patients will have an in-person follow-up on Day 29, regardless of treatment adherence and
      recovery status prior to Day 29, and a safety follow-up 60 days after randomization for
      clinical status assessments, vital sign measurements, clinical chemistry collection, and
      adverse event collection. Follow-up in-person visits are preferred but recognizing quarantine
      and other factors may limit the subject's ability to return to the site for the visit. In
      this case, the visit may be performed by phone. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring
      Board will advise the study leadership on safety aspects and overall progress of the study.

To maintain the blind, investigators will distribute blinded study drug treatment to patients as directed by the IWRS system.
