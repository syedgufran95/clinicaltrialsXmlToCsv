      through a survey.

    <textblock>
      The global spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) is affecting cancer patients and their
      treatments. Cancer patients are among those at high risk of developing serious illness from
      an infection because their immune systems are often weakened by cancer and its treatments.
      Due to the growing coronavirus outbreak, patients clinic visits are being cancelled and many
      are facing social isolation and strict restrictions on their daily lives. We want to evaluate
      the impact of the coronavirus on the patient's well-being and their cancer care by assessing
      the delays in their medical care and any other unmet needs. We have created a survey that is
      available online for any patient with cancer to fill out voluntarily regarding their
      experiences to date. The survey is available at:
      https://stanforduniversity.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_ctKS6ZSMYdEYoXX

        Individuals who are diagnosed with any cancer diagnosis . We plan to enroll as many
        patients as possible in the survey portion of the study - we have no limitation of the
        numbers and do not require a specific number to participate although we hope to achieve at
        least 50 participants who fill out the survey.

        Among survey participants, we plan to enroll 18-30 participants in semi-structured
        telephone interviews. These participants will be randomly selected among those who filled
        out the survey.

        The research procedures are as followed:

          1. Survey: An online survey link will include questions regarding the impact patients
             with cancer are experiencing during the coronavirus outbreak.

          2. Semi-structured Interviews (18-30 participants): For those participants who state that
             they would like to participate in an interview, a random sample will be contacted.
