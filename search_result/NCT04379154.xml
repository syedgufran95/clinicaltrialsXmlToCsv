  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in exhaled air is an innovative
      research area for respiratory diseases. This analysis can be done by the technique of
      electronic nose, simpler and faster, which provides an idea of the general profile of the
      VOCs without identifying them. The VOCs in exhaled air in patients hospitalized for COVID-19
      infection are analysed in this study, using electronic noses.
