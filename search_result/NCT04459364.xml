  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The virus infection Covid-19 fills our hospitals and intensive care departments in a very
      unique way and there is a lack of essential insight into the pathophysiology of the disease.
      As a result, very specific treatment options are missing. The US Medicines Agency (FDA) has
      in the last days given a general license for treatment with inhaled nitric oxide (iNO).
      Inhaled NO in Sweden (and Europe) is approved for the indication of pulmonary hypertension in
      adults.

      However, no one has yet described the occurrence of pulmonary hypertension, with or without
      right ventricular loading, in the Covid-19 patients who become so seriously ill that they
      need to be treated at an IVA ward. Knowledge of this is, of course, a prerequisite for
      determining the need for pulmonary artery catheterization (PA catheter, Swan-Ganz catheter)
      and also to better understand whether iNO treatment or other forms of lung selective
      vasodilation therapy may be of benefit to this patient group.

        This is a non-interventional retrospective study to be performed in an intensive care unit
        in Sweden. The study will include 80 Covid-19 patients who had been examined with
        echocardiography. Data will be collected through chart review.
