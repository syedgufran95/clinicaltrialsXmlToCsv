  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study (i) the host genome to identify susceptibility regions of infection,
      inflammation, and host defense, (ii) host response to Severe Acute Respiratory
      Syndrome-Corona-Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and (iii) viral sequence composition to
      define viral sequences which may be correlated with disease severity in addition to the
      metagenome of the throat swab will be analysed .

      This study aims to recruit adult persons with diagnostically confirmed Corona-Virus-
      Disease-19 (COVID-19) infection and with different disease manifestation who are included
      into diagnostic or therapeutic care at the University Hospital Tübingen (UKT).

      The COVID-19 Next-Generation-Sequencing (NGS) study aims to cover as many patients in Germany
      as possible. It is expected to include in Phase 1 (pilot study): 250 patients with different
      disease manifestation (extreme phenotypes) and individual risk factors by whole genome
      analysis Phase 2 (verification study): 1.000 clinically well-defined patients to ensure a
      broader range of overlapping phenotypes, to verify data from the pilot study.

      Phase 3 (confirmation study): &gt; 10.000 patients to increase the power (anticipated).

    <description>For 150 patients from the extreme phenotypes - complementary to Whole Genome Analysis of each patient also Whole Transcriptome will performed Analysis; DNA methylation analysis using EPIC arrays will be performed in the pilot study (phase 1). Identically, in phase 2 starting from month 4, will be generated WGS, Whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS), and methylation data of the 500 patients. Epigenetic changes are likely to occur upon Corona infection. Subsequently, genome and epigenome data with RNA expression pattern will be correlated.</description>

    <description>The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral composition is determined by Next Generation sequencing (different protocols for enrichment are available, and are currently being tested to successfully analyse the virus from different isolates). It is known that SARS-CoV-2 sequence is changing at least one position every second passing from person to person. Numerous variants have been described deriving from 3 different ancestral viruses (named A, B, and C) reflecting different distributions in East Asia, Europeans and Americans. At it is anticipated that other (super)infections may add to the severity of the infection and disease course, the entire metagenome of the throat is being sequenced and analyzed as well.</description>
