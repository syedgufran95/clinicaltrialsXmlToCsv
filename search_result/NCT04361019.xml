  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The period of confinement due to COVID-19 may lead to reduced physical activity levels with
      negative consequences for health and quality of life in the short and long term, in case the
      sedentary habits are maintained over time. It is therefore essential to know the physical
      activity and health habits of university students during the confinement, as it could help in
      the design of effective strategies for the post-confinement period, as well as for any
      similar future situations. The general objective of the study is to know how university
      students have adapted their physical activity and health habits to the situation of
      confinement generated by COVID-19, as well as to identify the determining factors and the
      possible consequences. It is expected that there will be modifications in the patterns of
      physical activity in this situation, which could vary based on sociodemographic and economic
      determinants, and could affect parameters of health and quality of life. A survey will be
      sent to all students by email through the corresponding vice-rectorates of the sixteen
      participating universities (https://covid19.ehu.es/). The survey will be completed &quot;online&quot;
      anonymously. Among those participants who wish to keep participating in the study, a
      follow-up will be carried out one month and one year after the end of the confinement period.
      In this case, those subjects must indicate their willingness to keep participating and
      provide a contact email. The follow-up period will allow to know how physical activity and
      health habits are modified in the long term.
