    <textblock>
      The objective of this compassionate use study is to provide access and evaluate the outcome
      of Remdesivir and COVID-19 convalescent plasma use in patients with COVID-19. This protocol
      provides a coordinated approach for distribution and guidance for safe and effective
      administration of Remdesivir and convalescent plasma with antibodies against SARS CoV-2 for
      treatment of patients with COVID-19 infection who are most likely to benefit from this
      investigational treatment and monitor them for the following specific objectives and
      outcomes:

      SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES

        1. Provide access to convalescent plasma for hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19
           infection (compassionate use, expanded access program)

        2. Monitor safety of the therapy with convalescent plasma containing antibodies against SAR
           CoV-2 and Remdesivir for hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 infection

        3. Evaluate outcomes in patients who received convalescent COVID-19 plasma therapy alone,
           Remdesivir alone, and both agents.

      Study Design: This study will be a prospective, observational clinical study with an
      intention-to-treat, cross-over design. Comparison groups will be patients who received
      convalescent plasma vs. those who received Remdesivir. In addition, cross-over to
      convalescent plasma arm will be allowed for patients who continued to get worse even after
      receiving Remdesivir for more than 48 hours.

      ENROLLMENT Patients will be recruited from all COVID-19 treating hospitals of Nepal which are
      participating in this clinical study. All hospitalized patients with moderate to severe
      COVID-19 infection will be screened for Remdesivir Treatment and those with severe to life
      threatening COVID-19 infection will be screened for Convalescent plasma therapy.

      Donors Convalescent plasma donors will be recruited from the record of the hospitals from
      where they were discharged. The COVID hospitals will be asked to collect names of recovered
      patients who have voluntarily shown interest to donate plasma. When possible donated plasma
      will be stored in respective hospitals or blood bank.
