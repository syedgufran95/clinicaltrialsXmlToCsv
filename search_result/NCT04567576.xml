  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We seek to study the behaviour of Coronavirus infection in patients with rheumatological
      and/or autoimmune comorbidities, understood as a particular pathophysiological universe with
      its own risks and eventual benefits, until now fully hypothetical to be confirmed by means of
      real and recent evidence. On March 12, 2020, an initiative called the Global Alliance for
      COVID-19 in Rheumatology (The COVID-19 Rheumatology Alliance) arises, as a rapid response of
      international coordination whose ultimate goal is to serve as help or guideline for all those
      doctors who seek be faced with receiving, evaluating, understanding and caring for a patient
      with rheumatological and / or autoimmune diseases in relation to the imminent risk of
      COVID-19.

      Within this context, this study seeks to use the information registered by the Fundación
      Santa Fe de Bogotá University Hospital as a participating centre. It is intended, under a
      prospective cohort methodology, to identify, analyze and compare predictive factors of the
      clinical course of COVID-19 in patients with baseline diagnoses of rheumatological or
      autoimmune diseases with the intention of establishing well-founded parameters that
      contribute to the improvement in terms of strategies of prevention, management and prognosis;
      benefiting both directly treating physicians and patients, as well as indirectly a health
      system that is predicted to be pushed to the limit as time passes.
