  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if the reduction in TMPRSS2 activity via direct inhibition with Camostat
      mesilate combined with standard of care (SOC) treatment will increase the proportion of
      patients alive and free from respiratory failure at Day 28 in SARS-CoV-2 as compared to SOC
      treatment with placebo.
