    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of baricitinib in combination with antiviral therapy
      for the treatment of patients with moderate or severe coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).
      Treatment with antiviral medications such as hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and/or
      remdesivir may act against infection caused by the virus responsible for COVID-19.
      Baricitinib may reduce lung inflammation. Giving baricitinib in combination with antiviral
      therapy may reduce the risk of the disease from getting worse and may help prevent the need
      for being placed on a ventilator should the disease worsen compared to antiviral therapy
      alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the efficacy of baricitinib combined with antiviral therapy in participants
      with COVID-19-related moderate and severe disease in terms of reduction of the proportion of
      participants requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or dying or requiring anti-IL6
      monoclonal antibodies compared to that seen with antiviral alone within 60 days.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the clinical findings in a cohort of symptomatic COVID-19-infected
      participants.

      II. To test whether cytokine signatures predict progression to invasive ventilatory support
      or death.

      III. To describe adverse events (AEs) associated with baricitinib when administered at 4mg in
      combination with antivirals.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe the decay in quantitative viral burden from saliva samples collected sequentially
      under treatment with baricitinib in combination with antivirals.

      II. To obtain preliminary data on efficacy and tolerability of baricitinib in combination
      with antivirals in participants with cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive baricitinib orally (PO) daily, and standard of care
      hydroxychloroquine PO three times daily (TID). Treatment continues for 14 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II: Patients receive placebo PO daily, and standard of care hydroxychloroquine PO TID.
      Treatment continues for 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed for 60 days after enrollment to treatment.

    <description>Descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, and ranges for continuous variables, as well as percentages and frequencies for categorical variables, will be provided to describe all the clinical findings in a cohort of symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-infected subjects. The collected data will also be graphically presented in boxplots, histograms, and scatter plots. Investigations for outliers and assumptions for statistical analysis, e.g., normality and homoscedasticity, will be made. Group comparisons will be made using either the parametric tests such as t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA), or the non-parametric statistical method such as Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variable and Chi-square test for categorical variables. Point estimates, along with the corresponding p-values and 95% confidence intervals will be reported.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome
             coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) in a respiratory tract sample OR positive anti-SARS CoV2 IgM
             antibody test that is approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or allowed under
             an emergency use authorization; either result obtained within 5 days prior to study
             entry

          -  Cough and/or pneumonia on chest imaging

          -  Moderate disease with risk factor(s): Peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) &gt;=
             92% on room air with one of the following risk factors for development of severe
             disease: age &gt;= 60 years, receiving medication for hypertension, diagnosed diabetes
             mellitus, known cardiac disease, chronic lung disease, obesity (body mass index [BMI]
             &gt;= 35 kg/m^2), active malignancy, immunosuppression (receiving biologics or
             glucocorticoids &gt;= 20 mg/d prednisone equivalent for &gt; 2 weeks)

          -  Severe disease: SpO2 =&lt; 92% on room air

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent. Adults
             not competent to consent will be enrolled with the use of an appropriate legally
             authorized representative (per California Code, Health and Safety Code - HSC)

               -  FDA regulations generally require that the informed consent of a participant be
                  documented by the use of a written consent form approved by the IRB and signed
                  and dated by the participant or the participant's legally authorized
                  representative at the time of consent (21 case form report [CFR] 50.27[a]). In
                  light of COVID-19 infection control measures, the following procedure would
                  satisfy documentation of this requirement if the participant signing the informed
                  consent is in COVID-19 isolation. If the technology is available, electronic
                  methods of obtaining informed consent will be taken. The electronic consent and
                  Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) forms will be
                  uploaded and available through REDCap

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for
             the duration of study participation, and for 7 days following completion of therapy.
             NOTE: Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in
             this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Women of
             child-bearing potential should use highly effective methods of birth control. These
             are those methods of contraception, alone or in combination, that result in a low
             failure rate (i.e, less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Mechanical ventilation, high-flow nasal oxygen, biphasic positive airway pressure
             (BiPAP)

          -  Venous thromboembolism within 12 weeks or previously diagnosed thrombophilic
             conditions or conditions that increase the risk of thrombosis. Individuals with &gt; 1
             episode of venous thromboembolism or pulmonary embolism in the past will also be
             excluded

          -  Prior receipt of other immunomodulatory drugs (e.g., any JAK inhibitors,
             immunomodulatory biologics, or other immunomodulatory investigational products) within

          -  Pregnancy and lactation

          -  Any serious acute infections or known active or latent tuberculosis

               -  All enrolled participants will be screened for latent tuberculosis infection by
                  testing QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus, but a documented negative test will not be
                  required prior to entry. If a participant is found to have positive QuantiFERON
                  that results after enrollment, baricitinib will be discontinued

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 5 x upper limit
