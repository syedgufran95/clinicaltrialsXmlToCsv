  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the SARS-CoV-2-CZ-Immunity study is to determine the time profile of the presence
      of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in blood plasma by quantification of antibodies or
      performing a rapid test in COVID-19 cured patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is caused by a new type of coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. It is a highly infectious
      disease, manifested mainly by fever, respiratory problems, muscle pain, and fatigue. However,
      despite the publication of hundreds of papers in the literature, fundamental information
      about the spread and course of the disease is still lacking in COVID-19. One of such key
      information is the time profile of the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 after the
      disease.

      The SARS-CoV-2-CZ-Immunity study is aiming at the determination of the time profile of the
      presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in blood plasma by quantification of antibodies or
      performing a rapid test in COVID-19 cured patients.
