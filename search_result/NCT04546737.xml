  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Viral pandemics, such as HIV and SARS-Cov-V1, have shown that they can lead to acute and / or
      delayed neurological complications. At the actual context of the pandemic Coronavirus disease
      2019 (COVID-19), neurological manifestations seem to be confirmed since in 85% of COVID-19
      patients, present neurological symptoms, including anosmia, ageusia, periorbital pain,
      dizziness, fatigue, even moderate headache, moderate memory and/or behavioral disorders.

      However, these neurological manifestations are not well studied and their radiological
      features are not well described. It is therefore important to assess these potential
      neurological complications in COVID-19 patients. To the investigator knowledge, there is no
      previous study in the literature describing spectral brain changes in COVID + patients. Thus,
      the goal of this work is to describe the radiological semiology using MRI and particularly
      Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic (MRS) biomarkers in the evaluation of acute and / or delayed
      brain damage in COVID + patients presenting a neurological manifestations that are initially
      related to the cranial nerves damage.

    <description>This is a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) technique which can detect the NMR signal allowing to measure under curves areas, amplitudes, ratios and concentrations of various metabolites contained in a biological tissue, in addition to water and lipids. This offers the possibility, in addition to the contribution of MRI imaging, to better characterize pathological processes (inflammatory, infectious, etc.) through spectral and metabolic changes that can be quantitatively evaluated. Spectroscopic measurements will be carried out with a mono-voxel spectroscopy using a PRESS [Point RESolved Spectroscopy] sequence with a short Echo Time (TE) of 35 ms, an intermediate TE of 144 ms and a long TE of 288 ms.</description>
