  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through history, there have been plenty of pandemics however; the social response to corona
      virus disease (COVID-19) is unparalleled. It is assessed that almost four billion individuals
      are living in social segregation during this mother of all pandemics.

      Initially described in China in December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by
      corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread all over the world and by 18th July 2020- there was an
      emergent figure of 13,824,739 confirmed cases and 591.666 losses reported to the WHO. To
      date, Egypt reported slightly over 82,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases with 3858 deaths. The new
      pandemic is injuring not only health organizations of several countries but also the
      financial prudence universal.

      Defining the clinical features and associated outcomes of patients diagnosed with coronavirus
      disease (COVID-19) is fundamental to improving our understanding and adequate management of
      this illness. Several articles have recently been published, describing the clinical features
      and outcomes of retrospective individuals with COVID-19
