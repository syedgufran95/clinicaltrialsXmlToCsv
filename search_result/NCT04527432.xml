  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic has had a huge impact on healthcare resources and staff
      in the UK. Understanding the key risk factors associated with infection amongst healthcare
      workers is essential for future pandemic response plans.

      Currently there are scarce data relating to the infection rates and associated factors
      amongst healthcare workers in the United Kingdom (UK). Studies of infection rates in
      healthcare workers have largely relied on the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase
      chain reaction (RT-PCR) test to date and it appears that Healthcare workers are twice as
      likely to succumb to Coronavirus infection, when compared to the general population and those
      from Black and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds appear to be particularly at risk.

      Currently there is no evidence that the presence of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2) antibodies provides seasonal or long term immunity to future
      infection.

      Therefore, this study aims to understand the current level of SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity
      and try to determine the likely risk to healthcare workers in the UK to COVID-19 infection.
      This study hopes to find out whether certain individual characteristics will have an impact
      on likelihood of infection susceptibility and antibody response and determine the impact of
      the presence of antibodies on the likelihood of future clinical infection over a 12 month
      period.

      The study involves an initial online survey and linkage to the recent antibody test, then a
      further online survey in 6 and 12 months' time. The data obtained will be linked to data that
      the Human Resources Department (HR) holds.

      Participants also have the option to partake in another antibody test at 6 and 12 months'
      time and linked to the data collected.

      Participants will have access to the study via the link given in an SMS (Short Message
      Service - text message) which will direct then to the first online survey.

      They will then be contacted again in 6 and 12 months' time to complete the online survey
      again.

      The survey answers will be linked to the results of the antibody tests by their mobile and
      Employment Number and also to data held about them by the HR Department.

      The survey will take approximately 15 minutes to complete and will include questions on the
      following: profession; work-line type; demographics and behavioural factors; ethnicity; and
      symptoms (if COVID 19 was manifested).

      Participants can also attend for another blood test (SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2) antibody test) to detect any presence of antibodies at 6 and 12
      months (optional) which will again be linked to the survey and HR data.
