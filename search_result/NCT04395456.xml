  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind phase 2 clinical
      study of the efficacy and safety of AMY-101, a potent C3 inhibitor, for the management of
      patients with ARDS caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      We will assess the efficacy and safety, as well as pharmacokinetics (PK), and
      pharmacodynamics (PD). The study will assess the impact of AMY-101 in patients with severe
      COVID19; specifically, it will assess the impact of AMY-101 1) on survival without ARDS and
      without oxygen requirement at day 21 and 2) on the clinical status of the patients at day 21.
