      This is a phase IIIa, prospective, open-label, randomized, parallel-group study designed to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral colchicine plus standard therapy versus standard
      therapy in the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in a population group with moderate
      COVID-19 compromise and requiring hospitalization.Aproximately 120 subjects meeting all
      inclusion and not inclusion criteria will be randomized to receive either Colchicine plus
      standard treatment or only standard treatment for 15 days

      Introduction: COVID-19 and mortality associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome
      (ARDS) pose a global public health problem. The increase in spread and associated mortality
      poses a scenario where cost-effective therapeutic options are urgently and effectively
      proposed to control and reduce the pandemic and even to reduce the number of deaths
      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral colchicine plus treatment standard
      versus standard treatment in the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, in a
      population group with moderate COVID-19 involvement and requiring hospitalization.
      Methodology: A prospective, open, randomized, parallel-group study, the sample size of 120
      subjects each arm of 60 subjects. Random assignment (1: 1) to either colchicine plus standard
      treatment or control arm (standard treatment) orally for 14 days. An initial dose of 1.5 mg
      orally on the first day, followed by 0.5 mg every 12 hours on days 2 to 7 and continuing with
      0.5 mg a day until completing 14 days ± 1. It will be followed on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and day
      28, evaluating physical examination, clinical situation, laboratories, and adverse events.
      The primary efficacy data correspond to the deterioration in the clinical status of the
      patients through the semiquantitative ordinal scale suggested by the WHO R&amp;D committee.
      Expected results: It is expected to find out how, through different pathways, colchicine
      could act in modulating or preventing the appearance of ARDS associated with COVID-19, its
      possible effects on viral replication and antigenic presentation.

Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and meeting all eligibility criteria will be randomized for treatment in a 1: 1 ratio through a central voice response system. Randomization will be balanced in each of the 2 strata: 1) hospitalized patients with clinical stage 4 (requirement of supplemental oxygen by nasal contact lenses or mask) of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, see ANNEX 2, who will receive in addition to the usual treatment for COVID-19 oral colchicine (exposed group); 2) hospitalized patients with clinical stage 4 of the WHO classification who will receive the usual treatment for COVID-19 (control group).</intervention_model_description>
