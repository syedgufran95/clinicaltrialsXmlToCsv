  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy of acupressure in promoting health and
      well-being among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The investigators
      hypothesize that providing participants with a remote and standardized self-acupressure
      training program will improve HRQOL and the perception of stress. In the event that the study
      demonstrates acupressure to be safe and effective for this indication, the training could be
      scaled up and deployed at low-cost nationally and internationally.
