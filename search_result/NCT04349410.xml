  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diagnostic determination of disease and treatment responses has been limited to qualitative
      imaging, measurement of serum markers of disease, and sampling of tissue. In each of these
      instances, there is a built in error either due to sensitivity and specificity issues,
      clinician interpretation of results, or acceptance of the use of an indirect marker (blood
      test) of what is happening elsewhere in the body - at the tissue level.

      The Fleming Method for Tissue and Vascular Differentiation and Metabolism (FMTVDM) using same
      state single or sequential quantification comparisons [1] provides the first and only
      patented test (#9566037) - along with the associated submitted patent applications ruled to
      be covered under #9566037 - that quantitatively measures changes in tissue resulting from
      inter alia a disease process. This includes inter alia coronary artery disease (CAD), cancer
      and infectious/inflammatory processes including CoVid-19 pneumonia (CVP) resulting from the
      metabolic and regional blood flow differences (RBFDs) caused by these diseases.

      The purpose of this paper is to make clinicians and researchers aware of this proposed method
      for investigating the prevalence and severity of CVP - in addition to providing rapid
      determination of treatment response in each patient, directing treatment decisions; thereby
      reducing the loss of time, money, resources and patient lives.

      FMTVDM - See Appendix A.

        1. Quantitatively calibrates the nuclear camera to guarantee that the measurements made by
           the camera are accurate, consistent and reproducible. This quantification is dependent
           upon the isotope being used, the camera and the timing sequence of image acquisition.
           Such calibration is NOT currently done and it is part of the patent. Studies have
           demonstrated that the lack of this quantitative calibration has resulted in up to 1/3 of
           the data being lost for SUV and qualitative interpretation; in addition to making
           quantification impossible.

        2. The patient presents in a fasting state - to eliminate digestive processes from
           interfering with blood flow distributions - and the differences in metabolic and
           regional blood flow differences (RBFDs) are enhanced with vasodilatory agents, shifting
           blood flow and isotope towards regions of greater blood flow and metabolism; enhancing
           isotope delivery, uptake and quantification.

        3. With a now quantitatively calibrated nuclear camera - in this instance a PLANAR camera -
           or SPECT/CT or PET/CT/MRI if specifically approved - to allow imaging to be done at
           patient's bedside reducing the use of hospital resources required for transport and
           decrease potential for patient complications resulting from a transport - image
           acquisition will occur for 10-minutes following peak enhancement effect of the
           vasodilatory agent and timed injection of the isotope based upon the enhancing agent.

           Regions-of-interest (ROIs) will drawn by the nuclear technologist - either at the
           bedside or in the nuclear laboratory - to provide FMTVDM measurements using software
           already present in the nuclear camera systems. Specific ROIs will be drawn of the right
           lung (total), left lung (total), mediastinum (thymus activity), and any specific areas
           where increased tracer uptake is noted.

        4. These FMTVDM measurements including MAXIMAL COUNTS +/- VARIANCE, provide the values of
           the most active pulmonary tissue resulting from the CoVid-19 infection and inflammatory
           response; just as it has previously been used for CAD and Cancer.

        5. From these FMTVDM measurements, the pulmonary tissue and the CoVid-19 infectious process
           results are placed on a Health-Spectrum showing where in the tissue transitioning
           process the patient is. The measurements also provide information about how rapidly the
           tissue is changing. FMTVDM provides the quantitative measurement of where the patient is
           at any point in time during their course of treatment and how they compare with other
           patients.

        6. Once the FMTVDM measurements have been obtained, treatment decisions can be made based
           upon serial changes in FMTVDM. Treatments outcomes are based upon FMTVDM measurements,
           including the maximum FMTVDM and the variance in those measurements. By comparing serial
           FMTVDM results, improvement or deterioration in the patient's health and the success or
           failure of the current treatment regimen is measured, providing patient-centered,
           patient-specific, patient-oriented and patient-directed decisions. Thus saving time,
           money, resources and lives - not to mention unnecessary side effects from treatment,
           which is not working.

    <intervention_model_description>Measurement of CoVid-19 pneumonia (CVP) and inflammation will be made using a patented method (FMTVDM #9566037 and adjunct USPTO submissions deemed covered by USPTO under the original patent #9566037).
Following FMTVDM measurements, patients will be randomized into one of eleven treatment arms - others may be added as information becomes available. Forty-eight to 72-hours later - providing adequate time for treatment effect - FMTVDM will be repeated.
Patients with improvement in FMTVDM will be maintained on their original treatment. FMTVDM measured treatment failure will result in a change to another arm of treatment. FMTVDM measurement showing no change will be treated by adding an additional treatment arm to patient care. Sequential FMTVDM studies will be carried out.
Simultaneous Immune and ventilatory RX. Ventilatory support per ARDS protocol. Applicable blood tests and PCR will be included.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>As FMTVDM is an absolute quantification method, which cannot be influenced by human error or bias, the final determinant of success or failure of treatment cannot be influenced. However, given the pandemic, medical, nursing, technologist and other healthcare providers will NOT be blinded to data. The availability of the data will allow real time assessment and decision making by the clinicians involved in the care of the patient.</masking_description>
