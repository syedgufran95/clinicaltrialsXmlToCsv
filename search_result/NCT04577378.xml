      Efficacy and safety of Drug combination therapy of Isotretinoin and some Anti fungal Drugs as
      A potential Aerosol therapy for COVID-19 : An innovative therapeutic approach

      The pandemic of COVID-19 which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-COV-2) has infected over 2,000,000 people causing over 150,000 deaths.It hasno
      currently approved treatments.. Airborne SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans initiate from the
      virus entering nasal and airway epithelial cells through binding to angiotensin-converting
      enzyme 2 (ACE2). TMPRSS2, a cellular protease that activates the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,
      colocalizes with ACE2 and can prime SARS-CoV-2 fusion directly at the plasma membrane. In the
      lungs, SARS-CoV-2 infects type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells, as well as alveolar
      macrophages that are among the first producers of pro-inflammatory cytokines. As key
      components of the immediate antiviral response, type I interferons (here after referred to as
      IFNs) are crucial for restricting viral replication and spread, through autocrine and
      paracrine type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) signalling. However, minimal amounts of IFNs have been
      detected in the peripheral blood or lungs of patients with severe COVID-19 In a mouse model
      of SARS-CoV infection, local IFN responses in the lungs were delayed relative to peak viral
      replication, which impeded virus clearance and was associated with the development of CRS .
      SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b is a potent interferon inhebitor and antagonist Here, we review the
      molecular mechanisms by which Retinoic acid (isotretinoin) and antifungal drugs can cooperate
      to induce interferon in covid-19 infected patients A study reported that 13 Cis retinoic acid
      induced significant upregulation of toll-like receptor 3 resulting in an immune response to
      dsRNA intermediate which can be partially generated during CoV-2 replication . TLR3
      sensitized by dsRNA and cascades of signaling pathways (Interferon-regulatory factor 1 (IRFs)
      and Nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) activation, respectively) are activated to produce type I
      interferons. The production of type I IFNs is important to enhance the release of antiviral
      proteins for the protection of uninfected cells. RA can be generated in multiple forms as
      all-trans, 9-cis,and 13-cis retinoic acid. A study reported that Retinoic acid induces
      directly the expression of two transcription factors, Stat1 and IRF-1 which play central
      roles in the IFN signal transduction. In addition, RA induces IFN-a synthesis, IFNs can serve
      as the first line of immune defense against viral infections. IFNs are very powerful
      cytokines, which play a key role in combatting pathogenic infections by controlling
      inflammation and immune response by directly inducing antipathogen molecular countermeasures.
      There are three classes of IFNs: type I, type II, and type III. Antifungal drug. Fluconazol
      or itraconazol can inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes, especially cype 26 which control retinoic
      acid concentration into human cells enhance both isotretinoin effect and Concentrations in
      Target Tissues This in turn lead to hyper interferon induction and synthesis in case of
      COVID-19. Also a study demonstrated that isotretinoin can be given as aerosolized via
      inhalation rout without any damage in lung cells. Repeated high doses of 13 cis retinoic by
      inhalation resulted in moderate loss of body weight, but microscopic investigation of ten
      tissues including lung and oesophagus did not detect any significant aerosol-induced damage
      therefore inhaled isotretinoin might provide sufficient drug to the target cells in lung for
      efficacy while avoiding systemic toxicity. In conclusion,isotretinoin therapy has furthermore
      a proven anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet and fibrinolytic activities which may protect
      patients infected with covid-19 from widespread blood clots. From this point, we suggest that
      isotretinoin will be the immunity passport&quot; in the context of COVID-19.

    <textblock>
      This is a small pilot study investigating whether there is any efficacy signal of combination
      therapy of Isotretinoin and some Anti fungal Drugs in COVID-19 treatment that warrants a
      larger Phase III trial, or any harm that suggests that such a trial should not be done. It is
      expected to produce statistically significant results in the major endpoints. The
      investigator will examine all of the biologic, physiological, and clinical data to determine
      whether a Phase III trial is warranted.

      Primary efficacy analysis will be carried only on patients receiving at least 4 doses of
      active combination drug. Safety analysis will be carried out on all patients receiving at
      least one dose of active drug.

      introduction

      In Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, cases of acute respiratory infection were reported in
      December 2019.1,2 The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), initially
      reported that the cause of this disease is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2), then it is founded to be a novel coronavirus.3Now, This disease, is designated
      by the WHO as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which rapidly spreads to other cities of
      China, and has become a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) following
      its global spread. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are fever, cough, muscle pain,
      fatigue, diarrhea and pneumonia, and can cause death in severe cases.4China has reported
      72436 cases of confirmed COVID-19 and 1868 fatalities through February 18, 2020.5 The innate
      immune system represents the first line of defense and initiates counteractive responses that
      protect the host from viral infection through evolutionarily conserved pattern recognition
      receptors (PRR) 6. PRRs include the membrane-bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytosolic
      sensors, such as retinoic acidinducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), which sense RNA
      viruses 6. RIG-I specifically detects the intracellular double-stranded viral RNA bearing 5'
      triphosphate and panhandle structures to activate antiviral signaling7,8. Once a host is
      invaded by a virus, PRRs transmit signals to the downstream kinases that activate
      transcription factors, including IFN regulatory factor-3 (IRF3), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB),
      and ATF-2/c-jun, with the help of different adaptor molecules (MAVS/IPS-1/VISA/Cardif for
      RIG-I, TRIF for TLR3, and MyD88 for TLR7/8/9) to activate IFN production9,10,11.Viruses have
      evolved elaborate mechanisms to evade or inactivate the innate immune signaling pathway for
      their replication 12. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious
      respiratory disease that appeared first in China in 2002 and has infected more than 8000
      people worldwide and killed about 800 of those infected. SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has a
      singlestranded, positive sense RNA genome of approximately 29.7 kb 13,14. Numerous studies
      have revealed that SARS-CoV develops an antagonistic mechanism to evade the antiviral
      activities of IFN 15 Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can lead to excessive production of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, but the production of type I interferons, which are key antiviral
      mediators, is reportedly blunted; Previous studies suggested that SARS-CoV papain-like
      protease (PLpro) inhibits activation of the IRF3 pathway, which would normally elicit a
      robust IFN response, but the mechanism(s) used by SARS PLpro to inhibit activation of the
      IRF3 pathway is not fully known.16 As key components of the immediate antiviral response,
      type I interferons are crucial for restricting viral replication and spread, through
      autocrine and paracrine type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) signalling. Type 1 interferons have a
      broad antiviral activity in vitro and are currently evaluated in a clinical trial to treat
      MERS-CoV However, minimal amounts of IFNs have been detected in the peripheral blood or lungs
      of patients with severe COVID-19 17,18 In a mouse model of SARS-CoV infection, local IFN
      responses in the lungs were delayed relative to peak viral replication, which impeded virus
      clearance and was associated with the development of CRS19 . SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b is a potent
      interferon inhebitor and antagonist 20 The dysregulated IFN responses are indicative of the
      effective immunomodulatory strategies used by betacoronaviruses. During the incubation phase,
      SARS-CoV-2 replicates stealthily in host cells without detectably triggering IFNs, leading to
      high viral loads1. Coronaviruses are known to induce the formation of membranous compartments
      dedicated to viral RNA synthesis and thereby conceal viral pathogen-associated molecular
      patterns (PAMPs; for example, viral RNAs) from detection by host pattern recognition
      receptors (PRRs), such as RIG-I and MDA5. Furthermore, several conserved betacoronavirus
      proteins, predominantly non-structural proteins (nsps), are known to exert direct
      IFN-antagonistic activities. Some modify specific features of the viral RNA (by catalysing
      guanosine-N7 and ribose-2'-O methylation) to avoid recognition by specific PRRs (for example,
      nsp14 and nsp16), while others, such as nsp3 and nsp1, inhibit the signal transduction
      mediated by PRRs and by IFNAR, respectively19

      --Impact of TLR3 on type I IFNs

      Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that initiate
      innate immune response to invading pathogens by sensing conserved molecular patterns for
      early immune recognition of a pathogens like viruses, bacteria, and fungi to initiate innate
      immune response to invading pathogens . In addition ,TLRs play an important role in tissues
      repair and tissues injury- induced inflammation. The emergence of highly pathogenic severe
      acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (MERSCoV) is a concern for global public health, as
      there is a lack of efficacious vaccine platforms and antiviral therapeutic strategies21. A
      study demonstrated that pre-stimulation of TLR3 polyinosini- polycytidylic acid (poly I:C)
      hindered MHV infection through induction of INF- β in macrophages 22 A study demonstrated
      that TLR3(-/-), TLR4(-/-), and TRAM(-/-) mice are more susceptible to SARS-CoV than wild-type
      mice but experience only transient weight loss with no mortality in response to infection. In
      contrast, mice deficient in the TLR3/TLR4 adaptor TRIF are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV
      infection, showing increased weight loss, mortality, reduced lung function, increased lung
      pathology, and higher viral titers In further research, Tsai .and Chen showed the high level
      of IFN-α/β produced from the TLR3-IRF3/IRF7 pathway and IFN-β is the reason for inhibiting
      DENV replication. In HUH-7 cells, huTLR3 can recognize DENV-1 and induce the expression of
      IFN-β, which can enhance the expression of huTLR3 on the contrary . TLR3 also induces type I
      IFN during WNV..21

      --Impact of isotretinoin 13 cis retinoic acid on TLR3 and TLR-2

      Many of the significantly up-regulated genes are known to be retinoid-responsive genes
      including: retinoic acid responder 1 [tazarotene induced gene 1 (TIG1)}, cellular retinol
      binding protein 1 and cellular retinoic acid binding protein 2. In addition, calcium-binding
      proteins (i.e. S100 proteins), serine proteases, serine protease inhibitors (serpins),
      lipocalin and solute carriers were significantly affected by 13-cis RA25 In addition, Gene
      expression analysis in SEB-1 sebocytes and HaCaT keratinocytes with 72 hour 13-cis RA
      treatment. Revealed that there were changes in several genes involved in apoptosis and innate
      immunity such as TNFα-induced protein 2, TRAIL, interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1),
      interferon-induced proteins, NFκB, the death receptor, Fas and TIG3 (a.k.a. retinoic acid
      inducible gene 1 (RIG1)). TIG3 encodes an RNA helicase and represents a key intracellular
      protein that like the TLR3, can recognize viral double stranded RNA (dsRNA). 26 isotretinoin
      can inhebit cytokine storm thorough inhebtion of TLR-2 astudy demonstrated that treatment of
      patients with isotretinoin significantly decreased monocyte TLR-2 expression and subsequent
      inflammatory cytokine response to P. acnes after 1 week of therapy. This effect was sustained
      6 months following cessation of therapy, indicating that TLR-2 modulation may be involved in
      the durable therapeutic response to isotretinoin.22 IN contrary, 13Cis retinoic Acid induced
      significant upregulation of toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) , mitochondrial antiviral-signaling
      protein (MAVS) and retinoid-induced gene I (RIG-I) and IFN regulatory factor 1 expression in
      a time-dependent. 23 this can resulted in an immune response to dsRNA intermediate which can
      be partially generated during CoV-2 replicationTLR3 sensitized by dsRNA and cascades of
      signaling pathways (IRFs and NFκB activation, respectively) are activated to produce type I
      IFNs. The production of type I IFNs is important to enhance the release of antiviral proteins
      for the protection of uninfected cells. Sometimes, accessory proteins of CoV can interfere
      with TLR3 signaling and bind the dsRNA of CoV during replication to prevent TLR3 activation
      and evade the immune response. Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) was identified as a
      critical factor in mediating TRAIL induction by retinoic acid in NB4 APL leukemia cells and
      SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells. Interestingly, 13-cis RA significantly up-regulates IRF1 gene
      expression (2.42 fold increase) in SEB-1 sebocytes 27

      Impact of antifungal drugs on inducing isotretinoin effect and concentration in targeted
      tissues

      Itraconazole and fluconazole are triazole azole ring antifungal drugs, which are multiringed
      synthetic compounds containing three nitrogen atoms On the other hand, azole antifungal drugs
      have been demonstrated to inhibit cytochrome P450 28Thecytochrome P450 family (CYP26) enzymes
      are responsible for RA clearance, and are potential drug targets to increase concentrations
      of retinoid into targeted cells31 CYP26 Inhibitors Increases Retinoid Signaling in Intimal
      Smooth Muscle Cells32 Itraconazole has less inhibitive properties than the imidazoles in rat
      liver microsomes 29. ICZ interferes with the ergosterol synthesis pathway of the host cell
      and inhibits cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly cyp 34 enzyme that metabolizes retinoic
      acid in human cells which increase retinoic acid concentration in to targeted mammalian
      cells40 leading to activation of TOLL-like receptors inducing its antiviral mechanism to
      induce type I IFN expression levels toward the induction of a preactivated state, thereby
      accelerating the virus-induced host cell response41 IFNs can serve as the first line of
      immune defense against viral infections.41 IFNs are very powerful cytokines, which play a key
      role in combatting pathogenic infections by controlling inflammation and immune response by
      directly inducing antipathogen molecular countermeasures.42There are three classes of IFNs:
      type I, type II, and type III.. Even though fluconazole has been shown to be a potent
      cytochrome P450 inhibitor 30 Here,we suggest that because antifungal drug. Fluconazol or
      itraconazol can inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes, especially cype 26 which control retinoic
      acid concentration into human cells antifungal can enhance both isotretinoin effect and
      Concentrations in Target Tissues This in turn lead to hyper interferon induction and
      synthesis in case of COVID-19 Astudy found that fluconazole has been shown to be a potent
      cytochrome P450 inhibitor32 Safety of Aerosolized Isotretinoin Isotretinoin (Accutane, Roche
      Laboratories Inc, Nutley, NJ) is an important drug, not only for the treatment of severe
      acne, but also for other diagnoses and in chemoprevention settings. Because the use of
      isotretinoin is increasing, it is important for physicians to be aware of the adverse events,
      toxicities, and management issues related to its use. The most important issue is that of
      congenital defects, which has resulted in new pregnancy prevention policies and programs
      implemented by the manufacturer. A relatively new concern is that of depression associated
      with isotretinoin use, also resulting in new policies placed by the manufacturer and the
      FDA., But here, in our review we highly recommend that any researcher who wants to apply
      isotritinoin clinically covid-19 his clinical study must be a small pilot study investigating
      whether there is any efficacy signal that warrants a larger Phase 2B trial, or any harm that
      suggests that such a trial should not be done. The investigator will examine all of the
      biologic, physiological, and clinical data to determine whether a Phase 2B trial is
      warranted. And he also must abide by these rules :Isotretinoin must be give in the form of
      aerosol thorough respiratory route in order for it to has an effect that is focused only on
      lung cells so as not to affect any other organs. Aerosol inhalation can deposit drug directly
      on the population of cells caught up in the early phase of cancer, potentially achieving much
      more efficiency compared with reliance on diffusion from the blood. Direct application of
      aerosolized retinoic acid to the lung epithelium may avoid much of the protein binding, and
      serious side effects on the other organs especially, congenital organs thus greatly
      increasing potency at the target site.35 Because a study on rabbits demonstrated that
      isotretinoin can be given in the form of aerosol without serious side effects . Repeated high
      doses of 13 cis retinoic by inhalation resulted in moderate loss of body weight, but
      microscopic investigation of ten tissues inhalation rout without any damage in lung including
      lung and oesophagus did not detect any significant aerosol-induced damage therefore inhaled
      isotretinoin might provide sufficient drug to the target cells in lung for efficacy while
      avoiding systemic toxicity © 2000 Cancer Research Campaign33 In 2006, a clinical trial
      conducted to assess the feasibility of retinoids for the treatment of emphysema, the FORTE
      study, was published (NCT00000621)33. In that study, 148 patients from five university
      hospitals were recruited and randomized to receive ATRA at either low dose (1 mg/kg/day for 4
      days/wk) or high dose (2 mg/kg/day for 4 days/wk), 13-cis retinoic acid (1 mg/kg/day, daily),
      or placebo for 6 months, followed by a 3-month crossover phase. Subsequently, they were
      observed for an additional 9 months before the final assessment. In the trial, retinoids(13
      cis retinoic acid ) were proven to be safe as the drug-related AEs were generally mild.37 In
      addition, aerosolized isotretinoin must be given with low dose in accordance to patient
      weight and also it must be given gradually concentration thorough a short period not
      exceeding 14 days from the date of giving the first dose In contrast to the long course of
      treatment, which is considered chronic treatment and Aerosolized 13 cis retinoic acid must be
      be given gradually in one daily dose increases from 0.2 mg/kg/day to 2 mg/kg/day as inhaled
      13 cis retinoic acid therapy for 14 days A study demonstrated that the application of
      aerosolized retinoic acid system led to a rise of Retinoic Acid levels in lung, but not liver
      or plasma. Cellular lung levels of retinol, retinyl palmitate, and retinyl stearate also
      appeared to be unaffected (245.6 ± 10.7, 47.4 ± 3.4, and 132.8 ± 7.7 ng•g-1 wet weight,
      respectively). And also demonstrated that the application of this aerosolized Retinoic Acid
      also induced a dose-dependent protein expression of the cellular retinol-binding protein 1
      (CRBP-1) in lung, without apparent harmful side effects.38 Although, more than one clinical
      study reported safety and non serious side effects of systemic isotretinon but we highly
      recommend that isotretinoin must be given in the form of aerosol with short period of
      tratment and with low gradual dose to target lung cells only for avoiding any potential side
      effects. A clinical study applied on 1166 patients thorough phase III trial (NCI #I91-0001)
      at a National Cancer Institute (NCI) demonstrated that after the median follow-up of 3.5
      years, there were no statistically significant differences between the placebo and
      isotretinoin arms with respect to the time to SPTs, recurrences, or mortality. In this study
      Patients were randomly assigned to receive a placebo or the retinoid isotretinoin (30 mg/day)
      for 3 years in a double-blind fashion. Patients were stratified at randomization by tumor
      stage, histology, and smoking status. The primary endpoint (time to SPT) and the secondary
      endpoints (times to recurrence and death) were analyzed by log-rank test and the Cox
      proportional hazards model. All statistical tests were two-sided.34 A study conducted on 720
      patients who had received one or more courses of oral isotretinoin treatment, and had a mean
      follow up period of 4.9 years (range 2/12 years). Most patients (442) had received a total
      cumulative dose of 120/200 mg/kg body weight. One hundred and sixty two patients received a
      cumulative dose of &lt;120 mg/kg body weight, and 116 received a cumulative dose &lt;200 mg/kg.
      Finally this study proved that oral isotretinoin in the treatment of acne is a safe drug,
      with no serious long term side effects.36

      Safety of Aerosolized fluconazole

      A study demonstrated that fluconazole can be given via route of inhalation. Respiratory
      fungal diseases therapy is still facing challenges as a result of increasing autoimmune
      disorders, cancers, and immunosuppressive medication usage. Fluconazole is a wide spectrum
      antifungal agent and is still used successfully in the treatment of opportunistic infections
      in combination with other antifungal agents. Since, the treatment of respiratory fungal
      diseases requires prolonged hospitalization; it may increase the chances of other
      opportunistic infections. Considering the reported drug resistance and adverse effects of
      systemic administration, it appears that localized pulmonary antifungal therapy may be a
      suitable alternative route. According to the reported suitable inhalation properties of spray
      dried powders; spray drying technique was used to prepare fluconazole powders.39
