  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to characterize the impact of inhaled remdesivir (RDV)
      on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load in participants
      with early stage coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

      This study will have multiple parts: Part A, Part B (optional), and Part C. Part B will be
      conducted if supported by evaluation in healthy volunteers in another Phase 1a Gilead study
      (GS-US-553-9018). Participants in Part C will be enrolled after review of preliminary safety
      and available efficacy data from Parts A and B through at least Day 7.

      GS-US-553-9018 is a Phase 1a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, single- and
      multiple-dose study in healthy volunteers to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of remdesivir administered by inhalation.
