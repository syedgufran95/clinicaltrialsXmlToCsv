    <textblock>
      This is a double-blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trial to determine if pre-exposure
      prophylaxis (PrEP) with 400mg hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), taken orally once daily, for health
      care workers in the hospital reduces symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 disease during the
      pandemic. 374 health care workers will be randomized at a 1:1 allocation between the
      intervention and placebo arms and followed for 90 days. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19
      infection in the intervention group will be compared to the cumulative incidence of COVID-19
      in the placebo group with relative (risk ratio and 95% CI) and absolute measures (risk
      difference and 95% CI).

      This is a double-blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trial to determine if pre-exposure
      prophylaxis (PrEP) with 400mg hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), taken orally once daily, for health
      care workers in the hospital reduces symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 disease during the
      pandemic.

      Secondary outcomes include 1) Adverse events; 2) Duration of symptomatic COVID-19 disease; 3)
      Days hospitalized attributed to COVID-19; 4) Respiratory failure attributable to COVID-19
      disease requiring i) non-invasive ventilation or ii) intubation/mechanical ventilation; 5)
      Mortality attributed to COVID-19 disease, and; 6) Number of days unable to work attributed to
      COVID-19. Laboratory markers within participants with confirmed COVID-19 will also be
      explored.

      A total of 374 HCW will be randomized using a fixed 1:1 allocation ratio with randomization
      in permuted block of varying sizes from four to eight will be used to ensure equal allocation
      to each group. The study population will be health care workers at the New York Presbyterian
      Hospital - Cornell Campus and they will participate in the study for 90 days.

      To determine if the intervention has been successful, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19
      infection in the intervention group will be compared to the cumulative incidence of COVID-19
      in the placebo group with relative (risk ratio and 95% CI) and absolute measures (risk
      difference and 95% CI). Investigators will also calculate adjusted risk ratios and risk
      differences including job class as a covariate and any other baseline clinical and
      demographic characteristics that are not balanced between the treatment and placebo arms
      using a log-binomial regression model.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Health care worker (HCW) at the hospital who work on a &quot;full time&quot; basis during the
             study period. For the purposes of the study, &quot;health care workers&quot; are physicians,
             nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, respiratory therapists, X-ray
             technicians, social workers and support staff (including but not limited to
             house-keeping, and porters).

          2. Age â‰¥18 years.

          3. Ability to communicate with study staff in English

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known hypersensitivity/allergy to hydroxychloroquine or to 4-aminoquinoline compounds.

          2. Current use of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of a medical condition.

          3. Known prolonged QT syndrome, or concomitant medications which simultaneously may
             prolong the QTC that cannot be temporarily suspended/replaced. These are including but
             not limited to Class IA, IC and III antiarrhythmics; certain antidepressants,
             antipsychotics, and anti-infectives; domperidone; 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)3 receptor
             antagonists; kinase inhibitors; histone deacetylase inhibitors beta-2 adrenoceptor
             agonists.

          4. Known pre-existing retinopathy of the eye.

          5. Disclosure of self-administered use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine currently
             under investigation &lt;4 weeks prior to study. This window is intended to account for
             the drug half-life of HCQ (21 days).

          6. Baseline symptom of COVID-19 disease at enrollment and baseline viral detection
             specimen positive for SARS-COV-2. All participants with COVID-19 symptoms at
             enrollment will be directed to have confirmatory testing (within the department or
             occupational health as per the site guidelines). Participants who are negative for
             SARS-COV-2 will be redirected to enrollment procedures, those testing positive will be
             excluded.
