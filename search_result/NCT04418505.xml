  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to obtain data on the efficacy of the Vielight RX Plus in
      decreasing time to recovery of symptoms in subjects with COVID-19. The study will be
      conducted among COVID-19 positive subjects at home in self-isolation via electronic data
      collection (EDC). There will be no physical contact between the subjects and the Qualified
      Investigator (QI) or other study staff. This study aims to demonstrate that the Vielight RX
      Plus is a useful adjunct to standard of care (SOC). We hypothesize that the Vielight RX Plus
      will accelerate recovery and reduce viral infection severity.

      This study is conducted entirely online. At no point will study staff be in direct contact
      with participants. The study will be managed by an independent clinical research organization
      (CRO), supporting a Qualified Investigator (QI). Vielight Inc will supply the RX Plus devices
      free of charge and will sponsor the study.

      Potential participants will be prompted to complete an online screening form if they are
      interested in participating. During the screening, the potential participant will be asked to
      upload a copy of their positive COVID-19 infection confirmation report and a valid ID. If the
      potential subject qualifies for the study, by statisfying all inclusion and exclusion
      criteria, the potential participant will then be prompted to complete an electronic informed
      consent form (ICF) via the electronic data collection (EDC) platform and will be enrolled
      into the study.

      This is a 30-day, prospective, randomized study, with no blinding. 280 participants will be
      randomized into two groups: Group 1: Standard of Care; Group 2: Standard of Care + Vielight
      RX Plus treatment. In Group 2, the Vielight RX Plus will be administered for 20 minutes twice
      a day, separated by at least 6 hours for the first 5 days. For the subsequent 25 days,
      treatment will be once per day. The Vielight RX Plus will be positioned over the upper most
      part of the breastbone to stimulate the thymus gland and within one nostril.

      During each of the 30-days, participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire to assess
      respiratory symptom severity, and log a daily dairy as well as oxygen saturation level (using
      a portable oximeter).

      The primary measure is time to overall recovery in days.
