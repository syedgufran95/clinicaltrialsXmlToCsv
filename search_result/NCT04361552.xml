  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase III trial compares the effect of adding tocilizumab to standard of care versus
      standard of care alone in treating cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in patients with
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. CRS is a potentially serious disorder caused by the release of an
      excessive amount of substance that is made by cells of the immune system (cytokines) as a
      response to viral infection. Tocilizumab is used to decrease the body's immune response.
      Adding tocilizumab to standard of care may work better in treating CRS in patients with
      SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to standard of care alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To decrease the length of invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) and rate of 30-day
      mortality from CRS due to SARS-CoV-2.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To decrease the rates of intensive care unit (ICU) transfer. II. To decrease the rate of
      invasive mechanical ventilation (MV). III. To decrease the length of ICU stay. IV. To
      decrease the rate of tracheostomy. V. Safety and efficacy of tociluzumab. VI. Biomarker
      assessment for response.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive tocilizumab intravenously (IV) every 12 hours for up to 3 doses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive standard
      of care.

      ARM II: Patients receive standard of care.
