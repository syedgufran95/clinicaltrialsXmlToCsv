  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic in March 2020. Early research
      in China suggests that children are no more susceptible to COVID-19 infection than adults and
      that children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with milder symptoms. However,
      the impact of COVID-19 among Canadian children remains unclear. The prevalence of COVID-19 in
      children in Canada is currently unknown and no published research exists regarding the risk
      factors of COVID-19 in children or its potential long-term health effects on physical health
      or development. Using TARGet Kids!, Canada's largest children's cohort study with over 11,000
      children involved, the researchers will conduct a longitudinal observational study aimed to
      evaluate the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in children and parents; differences among
      infected and uninfected children in terms of age, sex, and income; risk factors of COVID-19;
      and longer term health effects of COVID-19 among children. Given the rapid spread of COVID-19
      and the unknown health effects of the virus in children, research must be conducted to
      determine the extent of infections of COVID-19 in children, disease severity, risk factors
      for infection, and how the virus affects children as they become older.

    <textblock>
      The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic in March 2020. Early research
      from China has suggested that children may experience less severe clinical symptoms than
      adults, and infected children with minimal or no symptoms may be an underrecognized source of
      community disease transmission. COVID-19 infections in children were occurring very early in
      the epidemic but the impact of COVID-19 infection among children remains unclear. The number
      of COVID-19 infections in children and parents in Canada is unknown and studies have not
      evaluated the symptom severity of COVID-19 in children and parents, risk factors for
      infection and severe disease, and whether current preventive efforts are effective. Using
      TARGet Kids!, Canada's largest children's cohort study, the researchers will conduct an
      observational study to evaluate key epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 among parents
      and children, as well as to determine the spectrum of disease severity, risk factors for
      COVID-19 infection and severe disease, effectiveness of social isolation recommendations,
      risk to family members with a COVID-19 infected family member, and potential new strategies
      to prevent COVID-19 infection and minimize disease severity. Parents of 1082 existing TARGet
      Kids! participants will be asked to provide a nasal swab from themselves and their child
      weekly during the pandemic in addition to a respiratory tract symptom checklist. Preventive
      efforts (e.g. social distancing), parent-reported illness, laboratory-confirmed infections
      and healthcare encounters (e.g. emergency department visits, hospitalizations and ICU care)
      will be measured. Children will subsequently be followed through the TARGet Kids! cohort
      study over the next 6 months and long term, with interim analyses at 3 months. By
      understanding every stage of COVID-19 infection from prevention to transmission in the
      community and home, to outpatient and hospital care utilization, the researchers will rapidly
      develop new interventions to prevent COVID-19 transmission and minimize disease severity
      among children and their families.
