    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled phase Ib/IIb clinical
      trial of the Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the
      vaccine in healthy people aged ⩾60 Years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/IIb trial is designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of different
      doses of the Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine based upon the randomized, double-blind and
      placebo-controlled principle. A total of 471 subjects aged ⩾60 years will be enrolled in the
      study, of which 96 and 375 will be enrolled for phase Ib and phase Ⅱb,respectively. The
      enrolled subjects in phase Ib receive two doses of low-, medium-, or high-dose of
      experimental vaccines or placebo at an interval of 28 days, while the enrolled subjects in
      Phase Ⅱb receive two doses of medium, high-dose experimental vaccines or placebo at an
      interval of 28 days.
