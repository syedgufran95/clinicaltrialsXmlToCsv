  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of clinical features suggest the possibility of dysautonomia in patients infected
      with SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2).

      At the same time, there is now strong experimental evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can cross the
      blood-brain barrier, probably via the olfactory nerves, and reach the brain stem, which is
      located in close proximity.

      Damage to the brainstem nuclei could explain the suspected dysautonomic episodes, but also
      the severity of respiratory distress in infected patients, and the difficulty of ventilatory
      withdrawal encountered in resuscitation, potentially through damage to the ventilation
      control and regulation centers located in the brainstem.

      The objective of this study is to record the long term variability in heart rate, reflecting
      autonomic balance, of patients screened positive for SARS-CoV-2 throughout their stay in
      conventional care units at the Saint-Etienne University Hospital, in order to see whether
      there is an autonomic imbalance at screening, whether the worsening of the autonomic
      imbalance precedes the worsening of the clinical condition, and how quickly the expected
      correction of the autonomic imbalance follows or precedes that of the disease.
