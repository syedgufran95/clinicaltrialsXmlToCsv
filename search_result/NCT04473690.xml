    <textblock>
      This is an First In Human (FIH), observer-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel
      group study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of KBP-COVID-19 vaccine in healthy
      CoV-2seronegative adult subjects in 2 age groups, Part A (18-49 years) and Part B (50-70
      years).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be screened up to 14 days (Day -14 to Day -1) before randomization.

      Approximately 90 eligible healthy seronegative adults ages 18-49 years (inclusive) will be
      enrolled for Part A and 90 eligible healthy seronegative adults ages 50-70 years will be
      enrolled for Part B.

      Sentinel dosing (three subjects in each group) will be utilized in this FIH study. Sentinel
      cohorts will be used for the following groups:

      Part A (18-49 years) low dose Part B (50-70 years) low dose Part A (18-49 years) high dose
      Part B (50-70 years) high dose

      The iSRC will review the safety data for the sentinel subjects through Day 8 prior to
      enrollment of the remaining cohort subjects.

      When all subjects in Part A (18-49 years) low dose have received the first vaccination and
      have all safety data through Day 8, the iSRC will convene and review the safety data to
      ensure that there are no safety concerns and that none of the Study Halting Rules have been
      met before recommending that the study enroll Part A high dose. The same strategy will be
      used for Part B (50-70 years) when going from low to high dose.

      When 50 percent of the subjects for Part A in each dose cohort have been enrolled and have
      data available through Day 29, the iSRC will convene and review all the data through Day 29
      and any available data through Day 43 to ensure that there are no safety concerns and that
      none of the Study Halting Rules have been met before recommending that the study enroll the
      Part B (50-70 years) corresponding dose in parallel.

      Overall, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive study vaccine or placebo by
      IM injection on Days 1 and 22.

      All study visits will be conducted at the clinical sites on an outpatient basis. Subjects
      will participate in the study for approximately 1 year from the first dose.

             [m])2.

          5. Must be in general good health before study participation with no clinically relevant
             abnormalities that could interfere with study assessments.

          6. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and men whose sexual partners are WOCBP must
             be able and willing to use at least 1 highly effective method of contraception (ie,

             oral [in combination with male condoms with spermicide], transdermal, implant, or

             vasectomized partner [6 months minimum], clinically sterile partner; or abstinence)
             during the study. A female subject is considered to be a WOCBP after menarche and
             until she is in a postmenopausal state for 12 consecutive months (without an
             alternative medical cause) or otherwise permanently sterile. Note: Subjects not of
             childbearing potential are not required to use any other forms of contraception during
             the study. Non-childbearing potential is defined as subject confirmed:

               -  Surgical sterilization (eg, bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy,
                  bilateral occlusion by cautery [Essure System is not acceptable], hysterectomy,
                  or tubal ligation).

               -  Postmenopausal (defined as permanent cessation of menstruation for at least 12
                  consecutive months prior to screening) with FSH ≥ 30 mIU/mL at screening.

          7. WOCBP must have a negative urine pregnancy test before each vaccination.

          8. Must be able to attend all visits, including unscheduled visits if respiratory
             symptoms develop during the study, for the duration of the study and comply with all
             study procedures, including daily completion of the Diary Card for 7 days after each
             injection.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of an acute or chronic medical condition including dementia that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, would render vaccination unsafe or would interfere with
             the evaluation of responses. Chronic condition that are NOT included on the CDC's list
             of subjects at higher risk for severe illness from SARS-CoV-2 are acceptable if the
             condition has been stable for the 3 months prior to vaccine administration (Day 1),
             with no medication changes, and no hospitalization in the past 6 months).
