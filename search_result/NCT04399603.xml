  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the United Kingdom, there are currently 138,000 confirmed patients with coronavirus,
      causing 18,738 deaths. Whilst the disease may be mild in the majority of patients, a
      significant proportion of patients require intensive care therapy and a ventilator due to
      lung injury. In addition to lung injury/failure (acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)),
      around 50% of patients admitted to intensive care develop acute kidney injury (AKI)
      (requiring advanced support via haemofiltration) and multi-organ failure.

      It is unclear why patients suffering from COVID-19 develop such severe lung injury (requiring
      life support or ventilation) or indeed why patients develop other organ dysfunction such as
      kidney injury. The investigators hypothesis that this may due to an over-reaction of the
      immune system particularly in the lungs. This then results in the release of various
      mediators and biological messengers which can be pushed into the blood bloodstream
      (exacerbated by positive pressure generated by the ventilator). These mediators then travel,
      via the blood, to other organs such as the kidney where they cause inflammation and injury of
      cells, resulting in organ failure.

      At the Imperial College London (specifically at the Hammersmith Hospital campus) the
      investigators are in the unique position to investigate the pathophysiology of multi-organ
      failure as we are a referral centre for patients with COVID-19 who have developed renal and
      multi-organ failure (the hospital has accepted a number of these patients from various
      hospitals across the region). The Division of Anaesthetics, Pain Medicine and Intensive Care
      at Imperial College London, headed by Professor Masao Takata, has an international
      reputation, investigating the mechanisms of organ injury and failure (particularly lung
      injury) in critical care patients (non-viral causes). The investigators would like to apply
      well-established methods to try and further the scientific community's knowledge of this
      severe and deadly viral condition. The investigators hope that this would lead to the
      development of medication that would treat this deadly virus.
