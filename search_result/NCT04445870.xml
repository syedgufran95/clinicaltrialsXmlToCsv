      In december 2019, SARS-CoV2 and its clinical manifestations, COVID-19, appeared in China and
      caused a pandemic. It led decision makers to prioritize emergency and intensive care
      dedicated to infection management. Other conditions, such as cancer screening, diagnosis, and
      treatment, may have been delayed during the containment period. Consequences of this
      &quot;distraction effect&quot; are being.

      Quantitative monthly data were analyzed from January 1, 2019 to May 31, 2020 in two French
      tertiary care center (University Hospital and Godinot Cancer Institute in Reims) and in a
      third center in the French epicenter (Colmar hospital). Oncologic activity indicators were
      extracted using oncologic electronic file, International Statistical Classification of
      Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) and nation-wide procedure codes
      (CCAM). The monthly number of different steps of oncology care pathway (screening, diagnosis
      and treatment) were collected: faecal immunochemical testing (FIT), mammography,
      histopathological and biomolecular/genetics analysis, nuclear medicine imaging, oncogeriatric
      evaluations, multidisciplinary tumor board meetings and files reviewed by meeting including
      first presentations, given personalized care program, medical announcement and reformulation
      nursing consultations, inserted central venous catheters, chemotherapy prepared and
      administered in chemotherapy day care, carcinologic surgeries and radiotherapy courses.
