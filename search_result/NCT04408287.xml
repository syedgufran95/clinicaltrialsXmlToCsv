  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the current COVID-19 pandemic many spinal cord injury (SCI) rehabilitation services
      are limited to emergency management, leaving those living in the community without access to
      services. Unfortunately, this can lead to negative effects including increase in emotional
      distress, feelings of isolation, and decreased activity engagement. Due to their limited
      mobility and greater likelihood of respiratory illness it is imperative to provide
      alternative forms of activity engagement to reduce their risk for secondary complications.
      Physical activity has been demonstrate to have numerous benefits for individuals with SCI
      ranging from enhanced health through prevention of secondary complications to improved
      subjective well-being. The current study proposes to provide an online physical activity
      program through web-based videoconferencing to person with SCI to improve overall wellbeing
      and activity engagement. The program will consist of six weeks of twice-weekly, 45-minute
      sessions in which an experienced fitness instructor (i.e., wheelchair aerobics) with lived
      experience and a Kinesiology graduate student will lead online sessions. The sessions will be
      comprised of a 10-minute warm-up phase, a 25-minute aerobic phase and a 10-minute cool-down
      phase that will incorporate upper-extremity flexibility exercises and guided meditation. In
      all cases, remote (i.e., in-home) participant monitoring of physiological signals will be
      conducted by the instructor to ensure safety of participants. Once the program has been
      completed, participants will be asked to complete self-report questionnaires related to
      acceptability, feasibility, and limited effectiveness. Participants will also be asked to
      complete a brief semi-structured interview examining barriers and facilitators of the
      program. Participant feedback from the interviews will be used to further develop of the
      program to meet the needs of the population and develop sustainable approaches for access to
      care in the community setting through collaborations with community partners (SCI Ontario,
      National SCI Alliance, Ontario Neurotrauma Foundation). Ultimately, the proposed project aims
      to improve overall wellbeing and access to health care service for those with SCI during the
      COVID-19 quarantine.

    <intervention_model_description>The proposed study will deliver an online physical activity program to persons with SCI across Ontario through the WebEx platform at Parkwood Institute. Participants will be recruited from across Ontario through SCI rehabilitation centers and established service providers. Strategic advertising through community partners such as Spinal Cord Injury Ontario, Canadian SCI Alliance and Ontario Neurotrauma Foundation will also be conducted. Study participants will include those with a spinal cord injury that have completed rehabilitation and are living in the community. Participants must have some upper limb function permitting arm movement against gravity. All participants must have physician clearance to participate in the study.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The program will be delivered twice-weekly through 45-minute sessions over 6 weeks. An experienced fitness instructor with lived experience and a graduate student from the Department of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, will lead a class of 4-6 participants. The sessions will be comprised of a 10-minute warm-up phase, a 25-minute aerobic phase and a 10-minute cool-down phase that will incorporate upper-extremity flexibility exercises and mindfulness meditation. Over the duration the instructor will be sensitive to varying levels of function and fitness and will structure the classes to enable a slow progression of intensity. Individual semi-structured interviews will be completed over the WebEx platform to garner feedback and improve study programming for future implementation of a health care service at Parkwood Institute Outpatient Clinic.</description>
