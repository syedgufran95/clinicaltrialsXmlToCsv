  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, in France, in the context of the SARS Cov2 pandemic,both the number of affected
      subjects and the number of severe forms requiring hospital care are increasing.

      Several nosocomial transmission clusters have already been identified in hospitals (both
      pediatric and adult) but there is still limited data on the nosocomial spread of SARS-Cov2.

      This nosocomial transmission affects both patients and caregivers. It is important to
      understand the spread of the virus within the hospital. This will help to optimize procedures
      to prevent transmission to caregivers and hospitalizedpatients not infected with SARS Cov2,
      and more generally this will contribute to control the spread of SARS Cov2 in the community

      It is an observational study without any risk. Every participating service will be
      investigated for 2 consecutive days .

        -  At each staff rotation, an individualsensorwill be provided toall thestaff(caregivers,
           administrative, students etc…) to be worn duringtheirworking hours. Also a sensor will
           be placed at each patient's bedside.

        -  In addition, epidemiological data relating to socio-demographic characteristics,
           profession, protective measures will be collectedfrom hospitalstaff. Also, some data
           from the 'entrepot des données de santé&quot; regarding individual carepathways in the
           hospitalwill be extracted.

        -  A map of the unit, specifying the location of each patient will be made.

        Working caregivers and hospitalized patients in care services dedicated or not to SARS Cov2
        (including resuscitation services) in both adult and pediatric hospitals. Investigator will
        be interested in both adult and child services because the latter present a
        pauci-symptomatic form so the dynamics of transmission can be different.
