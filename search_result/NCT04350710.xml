  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this observationnal study is to describe respiratory mechanics and lung
      recruitement in patients with SARS-CoV-2 Associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome who
      underwent invasive ventilation on endotracheal tube, admitted to the medical ICU of Angers
      university hospital . Statics measurements of respiratory system compliance were performed at
      2 differents levels of PEEP (15 cmH2O and 5 cmH2O). The recruited volume is computed as the
      difference between the volume expired from PEEP 15 to 5 cmH2O and the volume predicted by
      compliance at PEEP 5 cmH2O . The recruitment-to-Inflation (R/I) ratio (i.e. the ratio between
      the recruited lung compliance and CRS at PEEP 5 cmH2O) is used to assess lung recruitability.
      A R/I ratio value higher than or equal to 0.5 was used to define highly recruiter patients.

      The investigators perform an observational prospective study in patients admitted to medical
      ICU in Angers University hospital with a confirmed COVID 19 pneumonia and who require
      invasive ventilation on endotracheal tube. Participants receive initially deep sedation and
      neuromuscular blockers for 24 hours and are ventilated in volume-controlled mode with a tidal
      volume of 6 mL/kg of predicted body weight, a constant inspiratory flow of 60 L/minute and a
      respiratory rate adjusted to maintain pH above 7.35 when possible. A PEEP decremental trial
      from 15 to 5 cmH2O was performed (15 minutes by step).

      Esophageal pressure monitoring and electrical impedance tomography (EIT) are collected if
      available. Arterial blood gases and respiratory mechanics are measured at the end of each
      step.

      The recruitment-to-Inflation (R/I) ratio (i.e. the ratio between the recruited lung
      compliance and CRS at PEEP 5 cmH2O) is used to assess lung recruitability. A R/I ratio value
      higher than or equal to 0.5 is used to define highly recruiter patients.

      By the end of the recording time, a low-flow (5 L/min) inflation from PEEP 5 cmH2O (tidal
      volume = 6ml/kg PBW) is then performed after a prolonged expiration to identify a potential
      airway closure and the corresponding airway opening pressure (AOP).

      Investigators perform these measurements at day 1, day 5 and day 10 from ICU admission if
      participants still require controlled ventilation.

      The investigators also collect clinical data about each participant (past medical history,
      ICU discharge, hospital discharge, date of death, ventilator acquired pneumonia,
      thromboembolic event, use of NO, use of ECMO or renal replacement therapy).
