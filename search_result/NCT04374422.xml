      World Health Organization declared new SARS-CoV-2 infection a pandemic, and many states
      enacted strict, rules such as border closures, transportation restrictions and
      quarantine.Many studies in the literature have described the relationship between mass
      disasters and female sexual behavior, but none have investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2
      pandemic on women's sexual attitude. The aim of this study is therefore to evaluate the
      effect of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on female sexual behavior.

      Coronaviruses are a group of RNA viruses that affect mainly the respiratory system and cause
      the common cold, fever, and coughs in mammals and birds. However, in some cases,
      coronaviruses are associated with more serious and lethal conditions, such as pneumonia,
      bronchitis, and severe acute respiratory syndrome. A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
      originating from Wuhan, China led to a global health crisis. At the time of writing,
      SARS-CoV-2 infected more than two million, resulting in almost 180.000 deaths. World Health
      Organization declared new SARS-CoV-2 infection a pandemic, and many states enacted strict,
      rules such as border closures, transportation restrictions, and quarantine.

      The term 'sexual behavior' encompasses a large spectrum of actions in which humans present
      their sexuality. Previous reports have analyzed the effect of mass disasters on female sexual
      behavior.

        From February 2018 to September 2019. For each participant, detailed medical history was
        obtained, including age, body mass index (BMI), education and income level, presence of
        comorbidities and the number of previous deliveries. Other details noted were menstrual
        status of patients, frequency of sexual intercourse and desire for fertility. All patients
        were asked to fill out the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) form. Patients' data were
        recorded in the electronic data system, prospectively.

        To identify the effect of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on female sexual behavior, the investigators
        conducted an observational study to compare the frequency of sexual intercourse, desire for
        fertility, FSFI score, contraception type and presence of vaginal infection between
        pandemic era (March 11th and April 12th 2020) and 6-12 months prior to the pandemic.
