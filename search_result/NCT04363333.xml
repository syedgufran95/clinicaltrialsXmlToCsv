  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Covid-19 infection is an on-going pandemic with worse diagnosis in adults with comorbid
      conditions such as hypertension and cardiopulmonary diseases. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
      is common in those comorbidities and may contribute to worse prognosis for the Covid-19
      cases.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' primary aim is to address the association between the high probability of
      having OSA and Covid-19 outcomes within 28 days of the hospitalization.

      Secondary outcomes will be conducting a polysomnography in cases with high probability of
      having OSA compared to those with low probability, approx. 4 months after the Covid-19
      diagnosis, and re-evaluate the association of the verified OSA diagnosis and severity with
      the outcomes in the first 4 weeks as well as with the outcomes after 4 months.
