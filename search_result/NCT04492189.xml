  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since March 17, 2020, the French government has implemented national containment measures due
      to the COVID-19 epidemic. Quarantine is an unpleasant experience : Separation from relatives,
      loss of liberty, concern about the infectious status, boredom, can negatively affect mental
      health, with the emergence of anxiety and depressive symptoms.

      In addition, confinement can disrupt usual physical activity, a major destabilization
      criterion for patients suffering from eating disorders (ED). Finally, conditions of
      confinement can harm social support, yet identified as a protective and resilience factor in
      stress contexts. Thus, the current context of confinement and social distances could be
      source of an increase in eating behavior disorders symptoms in people suffering from ED.

      Investigators will recruit 40 patients with eating disorders. All patients were initially
      assessed in the daily hospital of the Endocrinology, Diabetes, Nutrition Department
      (Montpellier University Hospital) from January to march 2020.

      All participants will performed a phone interview to assess eating disorder symptoms,
      caracteristicus of containment, 1 month after the beginning of the containment, and 1 month
      after the end of the containment.
