  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major disruption to healthcare systems with significant
      socioeconomic impacts. Currently, there are no licensed preventions available against
      COVID-19 and accelerated vaccine development is urgently needed. A safe and effective vaccine
      for COVID 19 prevention would have significant global public health impact.
