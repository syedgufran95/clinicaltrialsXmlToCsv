  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In COVID-19 deep airway and alveolar destruction occurred due to inflammatory reaction
      resulting into severe pneumonia. In COVID-19, lung injury is not only due to viral damage to
      tissue, but it is also due to immune response that leads to activation of inflammatory cells
      and release of cytokines. In COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS is produced
      due to mucinous or cellular fibromyxoid exudates, desquamation of pneumocytes and alveolar
      damage and hyaline membrane development and within 5-7 days disease become more aggressive
      due to pneumonia and respiratory failure. It is important to start the prompt and strengthen
      treatment for suppression of inflammatory response and cytokine storm. Methylprednisolone are
      the traditional immunosuppressive drugs. They are important and effective to delay the
      pneumonia progression and treating the ARDS.

      Corticosteroids are broadly used as treatment for ARDS and there was an evidence for its
      efficacy for treating SARS and decreasing mortality of SARS in the past. However for COVID-19
      corticosteroids efficacy and safety usage is still under clinical trials

      All new decision and new interventions that are made for decreasing dependency of ventilator
      in patients and decreasing patients mortality would have played a great role on global public
      health. The aim of the study is to address the efficacy of methlyprednisolone for the
      treatment of COVID-19 patients and its clinical outcome at a tertriary care hospital.
