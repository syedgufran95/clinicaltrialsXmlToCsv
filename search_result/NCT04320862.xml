  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) represents an unprecedented challenge to the operations and
      population health management efforts of health care systems around the world. The &quot;Pandemic
      Research Network (PRN): Duke Community Health Watch&quot; study leverages technology, clinical
      research, epidemiology, telemedicine, and population health management capabilities to
      understand how to safely COVID-19. The target population is individuals in the Duke Health
      region as well as individuals beyond the Duke Health region who have flu-like symptoms, a
      viral test order for COVID-19, confirmed COVID-19, or concern for exposure to COVID-19. A
      subgroup of particular interest within the target population is health care workers (HCW) and
      families of HCW. Community members will enroll in the study electronically and for 28 days
      will be reminded via email or SMS to submit signs and symptoms related to COVID-19.
      Participants who report symptoms will be provided information about COVID-19 testing (if
      needed) and established mechanisms to seek care within Duke Health. Instructions for
      telemedicine and in-person visits, which is available publicly at
      https://www.dukehealth.org/covid-19-update, will be presented to participants. Participants
      who are unable to report symptoms independently may be contacted via telephone by Population
      Health Management Office (PHMO) or Clinical Events Classification (CEC) team members. Data
      collected through the &quot;Pandemic Response Network (PRN): Duke Community Health Watch&quot; study
      will be used for three objectives.

        -  First, to characterize the epidemiological features of COVID-19. Specifically, we will
           have a high-risk subgroup of HCW and families of HCW that we enroll.

        -  Second, to develop models that predict deterioration and the need for inpatient care,
           intensive care, and mechanical ventilation.

        -  Third, to develop forecast models to estimate the volume of inpatient and outpatient
           resources needed to manage a COVID-19 population.

      The primary risk to study participants is loss of protected health information. To address
      this concern, all data will be stored in Duke's REDCap instance and the Duke Protected
      Analytics Compute Environment (PACE).
