      The aim of this investigation is to conduct an implementation research to facilitate and
      evaluate the implementation of VCT((Videoconsult through telemedicine) among HIV
      HCP(healthcare providers) and PLWH(people living with HIV)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Through prospective observational methodology the investigators are planning to evaluate
      VCT(Videoconsult through telemedicine) implementation. Both quantitative and qualitative
      analysis (mixed methods) will take part in the assessment. Quantitative data will be useful
      to obtain objective data in terms of proportion of subjects using the intervention, adoption
      by health care workers and measuring effectiveness. Additionally, qualitative methods will
      help to understand the outcomes focusing on the barriers and facilitators from both the HCW
      and patients, and their feedback on continuous implementation.

      Hence, perceptions of a vast group of patients and HCW will take a critical point in the
      qualitative analysis. Finally, by evidencing effectiveness, the investigators will be able to
      generalize and maintain this intervention as a good clinical practice. Due to the scope of
      the outcomes, the investigators will use RE-AIM framework.
