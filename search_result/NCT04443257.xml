    <textblock>
      Currently, the sequelae and short-term medical and psychological impact of the sars-cov-2
      infection (&quot;CoVID-19&quot;) remain poorly described. The clinical and functional sequelae that may
      persist after acute sars-cov-2 (&quot;CoVID-19&quot;) infection are essential to explore, in order to
      ensure the best possible follow-up of patients after discharge from hospital.

      Since sars-cov-2 (&quot;CoVID-19&quot;) is a newly defined infection, its sequelae and short-term
      medical and psychological impact remain poorly described.The clinical and functional sequelae
      that may persist after acute sars-cov-2 (&quot;CoVID-19&quot;) infection are essential to explore, in
      order to ensure the best possible follow-up of patients after discharge from hospital.

      Indeed, some patients may develop chronic respiratory failure, pulmonary fibrosis, or other
      comorbidities including cardiovascular or metabolic diseases. The psychological impact is
      also essential to assess. The sequelae and comorbidities of patients could also vary
      depending on the severity of the initial acute involvement.

      Investigators propose to explore the sequelae of patients who have been hospitalized for
      acute sars-cov-2 infection, between 3 to 6 months after discharge from hospital, by
      characterizing the incidence of chronic respiratory failure and fibrosis, as well as of
      various comorbidities such as cardiovascular, metabolic, and psychological diseases.
