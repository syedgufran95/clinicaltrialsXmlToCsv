    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a type of respiratory failure characterized by
      the rapid onset of widespread inflammation in the lungs. ARDS is thought to be the main cause
      of respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. Research is still ongoing to further elucidate
      the different ARDS subtypes that may exist in COVID-19. It is crucial to find new targets for
      treatment and support of COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure.

      The investigators hypothesize that inhaled prostacyclins (Iloprost in this study) may improve
      inflammation and oxygenation in suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients with respiratory
      failure.

      Research participants: Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients presenting to the emergency
      department (ED) of intensive care units (ICU) with Hypoxemic respiratory failure.

      Intervention: Inhaled Iloprost (Tradename Ventavis by Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc.)
      three times daily for 5 days Methods: patients will be screened in ED and ICU for inclusion
      and exclusion criteria and then consent will be obtained. The intervention will be started
      within 48 hours of presentation. Baseline parameters on oxygenation, inflammatory markers,
      hemodynamics will be obtained and followed serially over the period of the intervention.
      Additional data about time to intubation, time on mechanical ventilation, lung mechanics, and
      need for prone positioning will also be collected.

      Data will be analyzed for percentage improvement in oxygenation (Oxygen saturation and
      PaO2/FiO2 ratio), trends of inflammatory markers, and hemodynamic stability while Iloprost is
      administered.

      Based on previous studies of Iloprost on ARDS patients, the investigators anticipate an
      improvement in oxygenation and inflammatory parameters and possible prevention of intubation
      with shorter mechanical ventilation times. Iloprost showed a safe profile with stable
      hemodynamics during administration.
