  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus has already infected 4,673,809 people and killed 312,646 people worldwide, and no
      specific treatment or a vaccine against it has yet proven to be effective. Ozone therapy has
      become o promising tool for both prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infection by various
      possible mechanisms. The oxidative stress created by ozone in the body to stimulate the
      peripheral phagocytic cells, activate the antioxidant system, and restore the immune system
      is thought to be effective for the prevention of COVID-19 infection.

      In recent years, ozone therapy has become a popular alternative method for chronic pain
      management of various diseases such as fibromyalgia, knee osteoarthritis, and rheumatic
      diseases. As a result of this, there were many individuals who had received ozone therapy
      before the outbreak of COVID-19. This study aimed to investigate the preventive effect of
      ozone therapy against COVID-19 infection in these individuals.

      The inclusion criteria were determined to be completed at least ten sessions of ozone therapy
      applied by the method of major autohemotherapy in the last six months from the time the first
      COVID-19 case of Turkey reported (Mar 11, 2020). Individuals who received ozone therapy
      locally or fewer than ten sessions, who did not want to participate were excluded.

      The major autohemotherapy procedure to all the participants was applied as follows: 100mL of
      blood was drawn by a vacuum from the antecubital vein into a sterile glass bottle in which 12
      mL of 3.13% sodium citrate solution as an anticoagulant (MediPac®, Germany). A corresponding
      volume (100mL) of gas with an ozone concentration of 10-20 µg/mL was immediately added and
      continuously mixed by a gentle rotating movement to avoid foaming to the blood in the bottle.
      Ozone was produced by a Blue-S medical ozone generator (Turkozone®, Turkey). Reinfusion was
      accomplished in about 15-20 minutes, and the whole procedure was carried out in approximately
      30 minutes and was repeated two or three times a week.
