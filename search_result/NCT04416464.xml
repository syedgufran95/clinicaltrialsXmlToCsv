  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients suffering from pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, after admission to the
      Intensive Care Unit (ICU), are susceptible to development of various functional sequelae,
      increased risk of chronic diseases, increased mortality rates and existence of relevant
      impacts on their quality of life in the months and years that follow the ICU admission. The
      present study aims to assess the determinants of health-related quality of life and
      patient-centered long-term outcomes among patients recovered from SARS-COV-2 pneumonia, after
      discharge from the ICU, its determinants and predictors, in Portugal. It is a multicenter
      prospective cohort study of adult patients admitted at the ICU due to proven or suspected
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, included 90 days after discharge from the ICU. The primary outcome is
      one-year health-related quality of life assessed by the EQ-5D-3L. The secondary outcomes are
      all-cause mortality, rehospitalizations, return to work or study, the degree of dependence
      and functional capacity, symptoms of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress, level of
      physical activity and cognitive, renal and respiratory functions after ICU discharge.
      Investigators will collect data by means of structured telephone interviews, at a 12 months
      follow up period.
