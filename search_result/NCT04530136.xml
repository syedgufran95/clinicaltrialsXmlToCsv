  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate if adding rhC1-INH to standard of care (SOC)
      in patients admitted for stage II COVID-19 infection may reduce the risk of disease
      progression, i.e. ALI requiring mechanical ventilation, or increase the chance of a faster
      clinical improvement compared to SOC alone.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients fulfilling all eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio in an
      open-label controlled design to treatment with rhC1-INH in addition to SOC or SOC only
      starting on day 0. The first rhC1-INH treatment will be administered on the same day and
      continued for a total of 4 days.
