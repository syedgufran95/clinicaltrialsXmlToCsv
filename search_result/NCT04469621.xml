        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Participant must be ≥18 years and ≤80 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing
             the informed consent.

          -  Hospitalized (or documentation of a plan to admit to the hospital if the participant
             is in an emergency department) with evidence of COVID-19 lung disease diagnosed by
             chest radiograph, chest computed tomography or chest auscultation (rales, crackles)
             and with severe disease defined as follows: The participant requires supplemental
             oxygen administered by nasal cannula, simple face mask, or other similar oxygen
             delivery device (ie, increase in oxygen requirement following SARS-CoV-2 infection).

          -  SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR, or other commercial or public health assay
             in any specimen, within 3 weeks prior to randomization, and no alternative explanation
             for current clinical condition.

          -  At time of randomization, have demonstrated laboratory signs consistent with systemic
             inflammation.

          -  Male and/or female participants, including women of childbearing potential (WOCBP).

          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, unlikely to survive after 48 hours, or unlikely to
             remain at the investigational site beyond 48 hours

          -  Participants requiring use of invasive or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation
             at randomization.

          -  Presence of significant liver enzyme abnormalities, thrombocytopenia or anemia at
             screening.

          -  Any prior or concurrent use or plans to receive during the study period of
             immunomodulatory therapies (other than interventional drug) at screening.

          -  Use of chronic systemic corticosteroids for a non-COVID-19-related condition in a dose
             higher than prednisone 10 mg or equivalent per day at screening.

          -  Exclusion criteria related to tuberculosis (TB) and non-tuberculous mycobacterial
             (NTM) infections.

          -  Participants with suspected or known active systemic bacterial or fungal infections
             within 4 weeks of screening.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women.

          -  In the opinion of the study investigator, might confound the results of the study or
             pose an undue risk to the safety of the participant.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
