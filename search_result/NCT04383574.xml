      This study is a randomized, double-blinded, single-center, placebo-controlled phase 1&amp;2
      clinical trial in adults aged≥60 years. The experimental vaccine and placebo were both
      manufactured by Sinovac Research &amp; Development Co., Ltd. A total of 422 subjects will be
      enrolled, with 72 at phase 1, and 350 at phase 2. Subjects will be assigned to receive two
      doses of different dosage of experimental vaccine or placebo on the schedule of day 0,28.
