  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers are doing this study to find out whether the study drug hydroxychloroquine
      can prevent infection with the COVID-19 virus, compared with placebo, in people who are
      receiving radiation therapy for their cancer. The placebo used in this study is a tablet that
      looks the same as the study drug and is taken in the same way, but it does not contain any
      active ingredients.
