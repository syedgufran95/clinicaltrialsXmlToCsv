  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      COVID-19 is a worldwide pandemic and currently there is no effective therapy or vaccine.
      SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the COVID-19 respiratory infection, appears to be very
      contagious however all the modes of transmission are unclear. Transmission may occur in up to
      25 percent of cases when there are no symptoms (asymptomatic). Before there are any symptoms,
      droplet spray during speaking may increase transmission from person to person; most of the
      spray is saliva. Researchers at the NIH would like to test saliva for the virus before
      symptoms are reported. Additionally, they would like to examine the importance of using masks
      to prevent transmission. They hope to better understand how COVID-19 is spread among people
      and how it can be prevented.

      Objectives:

      To determine if the SARS-CoV-2 virus is present in saliva in asymptomatic individuals who are
      COVID-19 positive.

      To determine if using masks can prevent transmission.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older without symptoms of COVID-19 who have been in close contact (e.g.
      live in the same house) with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 or NIH workers who
      have tested positive for COVID-19 and have mild or no symptoms. Retested individuals may be
      enrolled to understand how the disease has progressed and resolved.

      Design and Procedures:

      For screening, interested participants will contact a study team member. The interested
      participant will be asked to provide documentation of COVID-19 positive status, their
      symptoms, or their contact to a COVID-19 positive person.

      Participants will have weekly telephone calls to discuss their symptoms and 2-5 drive-up
      visits to the NIH within 28 days.

      At the drive-up facility, participants will participate in a speaking exercise with and
      without wearing a mask. The droplets they produce while they speak will be collected.
      Participants will spit into a cup and have saliva collected from different areas of the
      mouth. They should not eat 90 minutes before this but drinking water or juice is acceptable.
      They may have their tongue painted with a sour liquid to increase their saliva. Participants
      will have a swab rubbed inside their nose. For those who are close contacts and need a
      COVID-19 test, they will have a swab inserted through the nose to rub the back of their
      throat.

      Participants will complete questionnaires about their symptoms electronically at home.

      Subjects may be asked to return to the NIH more frequently by the study team based on testing
      results.

      If at any time the participants start to have moderate or severe respiratory symptoms, their
      participation will end and they should seek care with their local provider....

    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is a worldwide pandemic without an effective therapy. A series of reports have
      implicated that asymptomatic transmission occurs in at least 25% SARS-CoV-2 cases. We
      hypothesize that droplet emission from oral fluids generated during speaking could be an
      important and actionable factor driving asymptomatic transmission. We aim to collect oral and
      nasal secretions to test for viral load and viral infectivity in 1) asymptomatic high-risk
      subjects with unknown SARS-CoV-2 status, but with a history of close personal contact with a
      SARSCoV- 2 positive person and 2) asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic subjects who are
      SARS-CoV-2 positive. COVID-19 positive individuals re-testing as negative can be enrolled to
      complete the electronic questionnaire(s) assessment and allow for evaluation of history of
      symptoms.
