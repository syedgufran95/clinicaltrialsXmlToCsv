  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a sub-study to treat participants that were not eligible in the main
      study (HUM00152509/NCT03874793) to receive MBCT or MRT in hard hit COVID-19 areas with trauma
      history and current COVID-related distress.

      The purpose of this treatment-only sub-study is to see how eligible participants with life
      history of any trauma and are currently experiencing elevated COVID-related stress are
      affected by two different PTSD therapies involving Mind-Body practices; Mindfulness based
      Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and Muscle Relaxation Therapy.

      The targeted individuals will reside in areas (Washtenaw, Wayne, and Oakland counties in
      Michigan, etc.) that have been affected by COVID-19. Participants will have assessments
      before and after 8 weeks of therapy (remote MBCT or MRT).

    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-adult short form level 2) Anxiety survey</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This Anxiety-Adult measure 7-item PROMIS Anxiety Short Form assesses the pure domain of anxiety in individuals age 18 and older. The participants will select how often they have been bothered by symptoms during the past 7 days from 1=never to 5=always (the higher the score the more anxiety).</description>

    <measure>Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ-16) Worry survey</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PSWQ is a well-validated self-administered, 16-item, Likert-type scale designed to measure worry. Possible range of scores is 16-80 with the algorithm of Total scores: 16-34 Low Worry, 35-59 Moderate, and 60-80 High Worry.</description>

    <measure>PROMIS (adult short form) Emotional Depression survey</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is an 8 question survey where participants will select answers of 1= Never to 5= always. The higher the score the greater severity of depression.</description>

    <measure>Working Alliance Inventory- short revised (WAI-SR)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 12-item measure that assesses therapy clients' perception of working alliance with their therapists, developed by Adam Horvath with 3 factors of shared goals, tasks, and personal bond / regard. The participants select from Seldom= 1, Sometimes=2, Fairly often =3, Very often = 4, and Always = 5. The higher the score the higher working alliance.</description>

    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-adult short form level 2) Anxiety survey group differences (MBCT and PMR)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This Anxiety-Adult measure 7-item PROMIS Anxiety Short Form assesses the pure domain of anxiety in individuals age 18 and older. The participants will select how often they have been bothered by symptoms during the past 7 days from 1=never to 5=always (the higher the score the more anxiety). This will look at the group differences between MBCT and PMR.</description>

    <description>There will be 8 sessions and these will be approximately 2 hours long. Over the 8-weeks participants will learn several mindfulness meditation techniques. Each session will involve group discussion and feedback. Participants will be asked to practice these techniques at home, and keep a log of mood, and stress ratings.
Audio files with exercises will be given to participants so that they can practice at home between sessions.</description>

    <description>Each MR session is approximately 2 hours. Over the 8-weeks you will learn how to relax your body using a step-by-step process in which you alternate between squeezing and relaxing your muscles. You will learn about your body's natural response to stress and how to use muscle relaxation during your everyday life. Each session will also involve group discussion and feedback. You will be asked to practice these techniques at home, and keep a log of your mood, and stress ratings. You will receive audio files with exercises so you can practice at home between sessions.</description>
