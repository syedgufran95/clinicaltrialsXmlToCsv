  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 22% of the global population is at an increased risk of a severe form of
      COVID-19, while one in four coronavirus patients admitted to intensive care unit will develop
      a pulmonary embolism. A major public health question remains to be investigated: why COVID-19
      is mild for some, critically severe for others and why only a percentage of COVID-19 patients
      develop thrombosis, despite the disease's proven hypercoagulable state? Patients' intrinsic
      characteristics might be responsible for the deep variety of disease forms.

      Our study aims to assess the validity of the hypothesis according to which underlining
      genetic variations might be responsible for different degrees of severity and thrombotic
      events risks in the novel coronavirus disease.

      Moreover, we suspect that prothrombotic genotypes occuring in the genes that encode
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE-DEL/INS) and angiotensinogen (AGT M235T) are involved in
      the unpredictable evolution of COVID-19, both in terms of severity and thrombotic events, due
      to the strong interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
      (RAAS). Therefore, we also aim to assess the validity of the theory according to which there
      is a pre-existing atypical modulation of RAAS in COVID-19 patients that develop severe forms
      and/or thrombosis.

      Our hypothesis is based on various observations. Firstly, there is a substantial similarity
      with a reasonably related condition such as sepsis, for which there is a validated theory
      stating that thrombophilic mutations affect patients' clinical response. Secondly, racial and
      ethnic genetic differences are responsible for significant dissimilar thrombotic risks among
      various nations. Thirdly, an increase in stroke incidence has been reported in young patients
      with COVID-19, without essential thrombosis risk factors, favoring the idea that a genetic
      predisposition could contribute to increase the thrombotic and thromboembolic risk. Fourthly,
      the plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 4G/5G inherited mutation was found to be
      responsible for a thrombotic state causing post-SARS osteonecrosis.

      The study's protocol will cover the following steps:

      • Collected data from COVID-19 patients at admission will include:

        -  Descriptive general demographic data

        -  Previous pathologies and thrombosis risk factors

        -  Routine biological data (the blood routinely collected will also be used for SARS-Cov-2
           specific RT-PCR exam)

      Complete thrombophilic profile testing by multiplex PCR and reverse hybridization of DNA to
      assess the presence of prothrombotic genotypes:

        -  Factor V Leiden

        -  Factor V 4070 A G (Hr2)

        -  Factor II G20210A

        -  Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T

        -  MTHFR A1298C

        -  Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) 844ins68

        -  PAI-1 4G/5G

        -  Glycoprotein IIIa T1565C (HPA-1a/b)

        -  ACE-DEL/INS

        -  Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)

        -  AGT M235T

        -  Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (ATR-1) A1166C

        -  Fibrinogen - 455 G A

        -  Factor XIII Val34Leu SpO2, respiratory rate, PaO2/FiO2 RAAS components

             -  Imagistic procedures (chest X-ray or CT)

                  -  All patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test will be included

                  -  Patients will be divided into three groups depending on disease severity and
                     the presence of thrombotic state:

             -  1st group includes COVID-19 patients with proved

        -  venous thrombosis (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or venous thrombosis
           occurring in more atypical places such as in the veins of the brain, liver, kidney,
           mesenteric vein and the veins of the arms)

        -  or arterial thrombosis (heart attacks, strokes)

             -  2nd group encompasses asymptomatic patients and those with mild or moderate
                disease, according to current guidelines, without thrombosis: no symptoms or
                evidence of lower respiratory disease by clinical assessment or imaging and a SpO2
                ≥ 94%

             -  3rd group includes severe disease, according to current guidelines, without
                thrombosis: respiratory frequency &gt; 30 breaths per minute, SpO2 &lt; 94%, PaO2/FiO2 &lt;
                300 mmHg, or lung infiltrates &gt;50%

                  -  Statistical methods will be employed to check for significant differences
                     between prothrombotic mutations frequency and RAAS components levels for the
                     three groups
