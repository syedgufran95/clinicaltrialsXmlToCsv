    <textblock>
      During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Egyptian government issued movement restrictions and placed
      areas into quarantine to reduce the spread of the disease. In addition, individuals were
      encouraged to adopt personal protective measures, such as social isolation , increasing
      personal hygiene and wearing protective face masks. Information regarding the COVID 19 virus
      and protective measures is found on social media and ministry of health website and a number
      of the Egyptian population are keeping track of them .Public Awareness play a major rule in
      reducing the spread of COVID 19 so in this study a survey is done to measure the awareness of
      the Egyptian population toward COVID 19 , their knowledge and attitude and their adherence to
      preventive measures.It also measures the change of their behavior during the beginning of the
      outbreak and after a few months of the outbreak in Egypt.
