  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019 a new kind of virus was identified in China as the responsible of severe
      acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and interstitial pneumonia. Severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) quickly spread around the world and in February 2020
      became a pandemia in Europe.

      No pharmacological treatment is actually licensed for the SARS-CoV2 infection and at the
      current state of art there is a lack of data about the clinical management of the coronavirus
      2019 disease (COVID-19).

      The aim of this observational study is to collect the data and the outcomes of COVID-19
      patients admitted in the H. Sacco Respiratory Unit treated according to the Standard
      Operating Procedures and the Good Clinical Practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All consecutive adult COVID-19 patients admitted to our Respiratory Unit will be enrolled.
      All demographic, anthropometric, laboratory, radiological, clinical and microbiological data
      will be collected and analyzed according to the primary and secondary outcomes (see the
      dedicated section).

      During the hospitalization, patients will be treated according to the standard operating
      procedure of our Respiratory Unit, such as arterial gas analysis, Rx, pharmacological
      treatment, ventilation. This study is purely observational and no randomization will be
      performed.

      After discharge, patients a 7 days, 30 days and 6 months follow up will be assessed.
