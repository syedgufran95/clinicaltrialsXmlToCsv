  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at the end of 2019 has seen numerous
      patients experiencing severe acute lung injury (ALI), which developed into severe respiratory
      distress syndrome (ARDS). The mortality was as high as 20% -40%. Due to the lack of effective
      antiviral treatments, supporting treatment is the predominant therapy for COVID-19 pneumonia.
      Its cure is essentially dependent on the patient's immunity. While the immune system
      eliminates the virus, numerous inflammatory cytokines are produced and a cytokine storm
      occurs in severe cases.

      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) play an important role in injury repair and immune regulation,
      showing advantageous prospects in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. MSCs prevent cytokine
      storms by retarding the TNF-α pathway, alleviate sepsis by modulating macrophages,
      neutrophils, NK cells, DC cells, T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes. After infused, MSCs
      aggregate in the lungs, improve the lung microenvironment, protect alveolar epithelia, and
      improve pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In vitro, Mesenchymal stem cells were revealed to inhibit the secretion of inflammatory
      cytokines by spleen lymphocytes and up-regulate regulatory T cells, thereby inhibiting the
      secretion of interferon-γ(IFN-γ) induced by lymphocytes and Tumor Necrosis Factor(TNF)
      induced by macrophage.

      Animal models and preclinical studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were
      implanted into inflammatory lung tissues after infusion, which significantly improved the
      clinical manifestations and histopathological lesions caused by acute lung injury.
      Mesenchymal stem cells inhibited the effects of interleukin-1 (IL-1) through regulatory T
      cells (CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 + Treg cells) and by antagonizing the expression interleukin-1
      receptor (IL1-RA). Mesenchymal stem cells significantly down-regulated pro-inflammatory
      factors by inhibiting the expression of IL-1, TNF and IFN-γ in lung tissue, and up-regulated
      anti-inflammatory factor by enhancing the expression of IL -10 and regulatory T cells,
      respectively, thereby dampening the inflammatory response.
