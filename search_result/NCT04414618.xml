  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opaganib, a sphingosine kinase-2 (SphK2) inhibitor, has been broadly tested in Phase I/II
      studies. Extensive nonclinical data indicates both anti-viral and anti-inflammatory activity
      via selective SphK2 inhibition which may prove beneficial for treating COVID-19 infection and
      resulting pneumonia. This proof of concept study will take place in the US and will enroll
      about 40 hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection who have developed pneumonia
      and require supplemental oxygen. Half of the patients, i.e. 20 patients, will receive
      opaganib in addition to standard of care for 14 days. The other 20 will receive matching
      placebo (capsules that do not contain the medication) in addition to standard of care. Study
      drug will be administered every day for 14 days, twice each day, unless the patient has been
      discharged from the hospital without requiring supplemental oxygen, in which case study drug
      will only be administered for 10 days. All participants will be followed up for 4 weeks after
      their last dose of study drug.
