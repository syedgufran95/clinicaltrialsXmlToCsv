  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background The immediate psychological impact of COVID-19 is already emerging. The
      investigators are interested in the benefits of a self-management booklet focused on the
      current circumstances in response to the COVID-19 pandemic on people's physical and mental
      wellbeing.

      Who can participate? The investigators are looking for participants aged 18 and over who live
      in the UK and can read and write in English, without any current serious mental health
      problems (e.g. bipolar disorder, PTSD, active thoughts of self-harm, or severe
      anxiety/depression), and who feel that their physical and/or mental wellbeing have been
      affected since the COVID-19 pandemic.

      What does the study involve? Eligible participants will complete questionnaires at baseline
      following which they will be randomly allocated to either receive the self-management booklet
      right away (via email) or after 4 months (waiting-list, in the meantime participants will be
      provided a link to educational materials). Participants will not be able to choose whether
      they will receive the self-management booklet right away or be in the waiting-list as a
      computer system (Qualtrics randomiser) will allocate them to one of the two groups at random.
      Participants in both conditions will be asked to complete online questionnaires at multiple
      time points, 2-months and 4-months after allocation. Participants in the waiting-list
      condition will also be asked to complete the same set of questionnaires at 6- and 8-months
      after allocation to assess how beneficial they found the self-management booklet.

      Participants will also be invited to take part in an audio-recorded interview after T2 to
      tell us more about how they found the self-management booklet or the educational materials.
      The investigators will select 30 participants (15 from each condition) for the interview out
      of those who opt-in to capture a wide range of experiences and backgrounds.

      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? Risks to participants are small.
      Participants may find reflecting on the impact of COVID-19 on their lives distressing.
      However, these effects are anticipated to be short lived, as participants will learn
      psychological techniques during the intervention that can help them manage better in the
      current circumstances and improve their wellbeing.

      Where is the study run from? The lead site is King's College London. The study is run online
      via Qualtrics.

      When is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for? May 2020 to May 2021

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the UK, over 4 in 5 Britons are worried about the effect COVID-19 is having on their life,
      with over half reporting that their wellbeing has been affected. Providing support for
      individuals to build optimal structures to maintain their physical and mental wellbeing is
      key to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic on day-to-day life and in the longer term.
      The investigators would like to conduct a randomised-controlled trial to test the efficacy of
      a theory-based self-management booklet to improve physical and mental wellbeing versus
      education alone. The trial will include a nested qualitative study to explore in a subgroup
      of participants their experiences of the self-management booklet or education alone. The
      primary objective is to examine the efficacy of the self-management booklet at improving
      wellbeing as compared to the waiting-list control arm 2-months post-randomisation. The
      investigators also want to explore the treatment effects of the self-management booklet on
      secondary outcomes (health status, day-to-day activities, resilience, intolerance of
      uncertainty, loneliness, social support, sleep quality, napping, sedentary behaviour,
      physical activity, and COVID-19-related behaviours, symptom complaints). Tertiary objectives
      include exploring changes in self-reported primary and secondary outcomes over time in a
      non-randomised analysis combining data from both arms and qualitatively exploring
      participants' perceptions of the acceptability and usefulness of the self-management booklet.
      These objectives will be addressed by a two-armed parallel randomised controlled trial (RCT)
      with a nested qualitative study. The study will be conducted through Qualitrics (including
      recruitment, randomisation, and data collection). Participants in both arms will be
      followed-up at 2 and 4 months post-randomisation. Additionally, participants in the control
      arm will receive the self-management booklet after the 4-months follow-up assessment and will
      be followed-up at 6 and 8 months post-randomisation.

    <description>The purpose of this booklet is to support adjustment to the current circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic and facilitate the development and maintenance of healthy behaviours at home. The booklet covers a range of topics, including understanding bodily sensations and symptoms of COVID-19, managing the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, physical activity, sedentary behaviour, sleep, social support and isolation, nutrition and alcohol consumption, sex and intimate relationships, and coping with children at home. The booklet will provide structured guidance on the various topics through the use of effective behaviour change techniques, in particular self-monitoring, goal setting, and problem solving and signposting to additional helpful resources, such as drinking or nutrition tracking apps.</description>
