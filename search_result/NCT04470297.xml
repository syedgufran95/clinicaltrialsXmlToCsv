      COVID-19 is impacting on health systems in Brazil and worldwide. Reducing the risk of
      clinical deterioration and prolonged disease duration in hospitalized patients with COVID-19
      may alleviate the burden caused by the pandemic. Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) has
      demonstrated antiapoptotic, antioxidative, and anti-inflammatory roles and has been suggested
      as a potential protector against organ injuries and even mediate lower mortality rates after
      polymicrobial sepsis in animal models. Melatonin agonists may modulate protective effects
      against acute lung injury and play a clinical role in individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
      The investigators proposed a clinical trial testing the effects of ramelteon 8mg in
      hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

    <textblock>
      The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) pandemic, also denominated
      Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), is currently challenging health systems in Brazil and
      worldwide. The mortality rate of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Brazil seems to be close to
      twice that of countries like Germany and Canada. (1-3) The resulted viral interstitial
      pneumonia can lead to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure, overcrowded intensive care units
      (ICUs), shortages of equipment and personnel, and increased mortality. (4-6)

      Some reasons for higher mortality risk in Brazil can be related to an increased propensity of
      clinical worsening in hospitalized patients. Consequently, reducing the risk of clinical
      deterioration and prolonged disease duration in hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate
      COVID-19 has become a priority to reduce the burden of such pandemic and the admission to
      ICUs. However, to our knowledge, few and complex specific interventions have been tested
      targeting outcomes related to a reduction of the immediate risk of severe disease and
      prolonged hospitalization in inpatients with mild-to-moderate clinical signs and symptoms.

      Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a hormone synthesized mainly by the pineal gland
      and also by other nonendocrine organs, including the immune system. Among its multiple
      properties, melatonin has demonstrated antiapoptotic, antioxidative, and anti-inflammatory
      roles exerted via both receptor-dependent and receptor-independent signalling cascades. (7,8)
      It has been suggested that melatonin receptors activation protects against organ injuries.
      (9-10). Additionally, melatonin receptors can mediate lower mortality rates after
      polymicrobial sepsis in animal models. (11)

      Melatonin potentially modulates immune response by enhancing the secretion of
      anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL-10, which is involved in the Th2-like immune
      response. (12) IL-10 has effects on a myriad of cell types and, in lung cells under damaging
      circumstances, its production turns undermined. (13) Recent findings indicated that melatonin
      receptors are modulators of protective effects against acute lung injury induced by the
      ventilator in rats through the up-regulation of IL-10 production. (14) This evidence upsurged
      testing the effects of ramelteon, a potent and highly selective agonist of high-affinity
      melatonin receptors 1 (MT1) and MT2, which further displays antioxidative and
      anti-inflammatory properties. (15-17) Melatonin agonism may play a clinical role in
      individuals with acute lung injuries, including those induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, which
      has not yet been investigated. The investigators designed a clinical trial testing standard
      care versus ramelteon 8mg under diverse clinical and laboratory outcomes related to the
      COVID-19 in hospitalized patients with this condition.
