      Purpose of the study:

      Study of the effectiveness and safety of the drug Mefloquine, tablets 250 mg, produced by
      FSUE &quot;SPC&quot; farmzaschita &quot; FMBA of Russia (Russia), in comparison with the drug
      Hydroxychloroquine, tablets 200 mg, for the treatment of patients with coronavirus infection,
      in the &quot;off-label&quot; mode, to make a decision on the possibility of expanding the indications
      for use.

      Study aims:

        1. To study the efficacy of the drug Mefloquine, tablet 250 mg, for the treatment of
           patients with coronavirus infection (light and medium-heavy form), the appointment in
           the &quot;off-label&quot; in comparison with the drug Hydroxychloroquine tablets 200 mg, when
           administered in the mode &quot;off label&quot;.

        2. To study the effectiveness of the drug Mefloquine, tablet 250 mg, when administered in
           the mode &quot;off label&quot;, in comparison with the drug Hydroxychloroquine tablets 200 mg,
           when administered in the mode &quot;off label&quot; when applied to a schema for the treatment of
           patients with severe coronavirus infection.

        3. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of Mefloquine, 250 mg tablets, and
           Hydroxychloroquine, 200 mg tablets, for the treatment of patients with coronavirus
           infection (mild and moderate-severe forms).

        4. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of Mefloquine, 250 mg tablets, and
           Hydroxychloroquine, 200 mg tablets, for the treatment of patients with coronavirus
           infection (severe forms), when used as part of a regimen for the treatment of patients
           with severe coronavirus infection.

      Study design:

      An open, randomized, multicenter comparative study of the efficacy and safety of Mefloquine
      and Hydroxychloroquine in &quot;off-label&quot; mode for the treatment of patients with COVID-19
      coronavirus infection
