  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus named as
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) was reported in Wuhan city,
      China, and spread exponentially throughout China and other countries in the following weeks.

      It is recommended that elective endoscopies should be deferred during the COVID-19 outbreak
      for the potential transmission between patients and medical staff in the statements of Asian
      Pacific Society for Digestive Endoscopy (APSDE-COVID statements). Therefore, exploring an
      alternative for patients with the requirements of endoscopy during the outbreak is of great
      importance.

      Herein,the investigators developed an novel non-contact magnetically-controlled capsule
      endoscopy (Nc-MCE) system (Figure 1) adds a remote control workstation and a audio-visual
      exchange system to the original well-established MCE system.

      This study was a open-label, prospective, randomized controlled study approved by the
      institutional review board of Shanghai Changhai Hospital. It was designed to evaluate the
      diagnostic utility, safety, feasibility and patients acceptability of Nc-MCE in patients with
      an indication of endoscopy, and comparing it with the result of MCE.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The nc-MCE system added a remote control workstation and an audio-visual exchange system to
      the original well-establish MCE system.Conventional protective measures could be adopted to
      endoscopist. Although the endoscopist and the patient are in different rooms, the endoscopist
      was able to see the patient and communicate with him or her through the audio-visual exchange
      system all the time. In order to simplify the examination procedure, the data recorder was
      putted on the examination bed. The patient lay down after swallowing the capsule under the
      remote guidance of the endoscopist.And the endoscopist of MCE and nc-MCE was the same one
      with experience of more than 1000 cases of MCCG operation.

      The investigators recruited 40 patients who have related symptom and healthy people mainly
      from outpatient clinic or hospital health examination center. After fully understanding the
      procedure of nc-MCE, patients with informed consent were randomly divided into MCE group and
      nc-MCE group(1:1) by using a stratified block randomization(block size four).

      The basic characteristics of the enrolled patients were prospectively collected. The primary
      endpoint was the maneuverability score evaluated by endoscopist. And the investigators choose
      the gastric examination time,the comfort and acceptability of patients, diagnostic yield and
      completeness of gastric examination as the secondary endpoint. The safety endpoint of nc-MCE
      was evaluated by the occurrence of adverse events.

    <description>After an overnight fasting and drinking 1000 mL water and simethicone for gastric dilatation and preparation, the study subject positions himself (herself) on the examination bed in Room A, while the operating doctor sits in Room B at the remote control workstation instructing her to swallow the capsule via the audio-visual exchange system. After the capsule entering the stomach, the doctor manipulated the two joysticks on the remote control workstation, mobilizing the robotic magnetic arm, and simultaneously driving the precise movement and rotation of the capsule to perform the gastric examination. In order to simplify the examination procedure, the data recorder was put on the examination bed. The patient lay down after swallowing the capsule under the remote guidance of the endoscopist.</description>

    <description>After an overnight fasting and drinking 1000 mL water and simethicone for gastric dilatation and preparation, the subjects put on the data recorder with the help of an endoscopist. Then, the endoscopist activated the capsule with the capsule locator. The patient was instructed to assume the supine or left lateral decubitus position and to swallow the capsule with a small amount of water to effectively observe the esophagus and dentate line. Then, under the guidance of the endoscopist face to face, the subject turned over on the bed to complete the examination.</description>
