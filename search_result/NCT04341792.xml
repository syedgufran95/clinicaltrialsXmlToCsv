  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no predictive tool for patients admitted to the emergency department with a
      suspicion of Covid-19 that will worsen secondarily and require a heavy lifting.

      In a context of saturation of the healthcare system by the pandemic at Covid-19,it is
      essential to identify specific, accessible prognostic markers via minimally invasive sampling
      with low risk of infection for personnel caregiver, for optimal allocation of resuscitation
      resources.

      This study proposes to evaluate the biological markers of routine care known to be associated
      with resuscitation admission in relation to hospitalization on conventional service for the
      prediction of worsening of patients admitted to the emergencies for Covid-19.
