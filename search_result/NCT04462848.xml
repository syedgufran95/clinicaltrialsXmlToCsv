  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will provide access to investigational anti-SARS-CoV-2 human convalescent plasma
      for pediatric patients with underlying medical conditions (cardiovascular disease, lung
      disease, immunosuppression) who are either infected with SARS-CoV-2 or who have had a
      high-risk exposure. Study participants will be transfused once with compatible convalescent
      plasma obtained from an individual who has recovered from documented infection with
      SARS-CoV-2. Safety information and pharmacokinetic data will be collected.

    <description>A Grade 3 adverse event is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in which symptoms are severe and cause inability to perform usual social and functional activities with medical intervention or therapy indicated.
A Grade 4 adverse event is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in which potentially life-threatening symptoms cause inability to perform basic self-care functions with medical intervention or therapy indicated to prevent permanent impairment, persistent disability, or death.</description>

    <measure>Cumulative incidence of serious adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>up to Day 28 post-administration of study plasma</time_frame>
    <description>A serious adverse event is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence that:
results in death,
is life-threatening,
requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,
results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or
is an important medical event that may or may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 1 month and &lt; 18 years at the time of consent.

          -  Determined to be at high-risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 disease based on the American
             Academy of Pediatrics definition of immunocompromised children and reported high-risk
             pediatric subpopulations. These include the following groups: immunocompromised,
             hemodynamically significant cardiac disease (e.g. congenital heart disease), lung
             disease with chronic respiratory failure, infant, i.e. child ≤1 year old.

          -  Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection OR high-risk exposure as defined:

               -  Confirmed infection: Child who tested positive for COVID-19 and is no more than
                  96 hours after onset of symptoms (and within 120 hours at the time of receipt of
                  study plasma).

               -  High-risk exposure: Susceptible child who was not previously infected or
                  otherwise immune to SARS-CoV-2 and exposed within 96 hours prior to enrollment
                  (and within 120 hours at the time of receipt of study plasma). Both criteria
                  below should be met:

                    1. A household member or daycare center (same room) exposure to a person with
                       confirmed SARS-CoV-2 OR with clinically compatible disease in areas with
                       widespread ongoing transmission

                    2. Negative for SARS-CoV-2 (nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab)

          -  For females of reproductive potential (defined as having experienced menarche), not
             pregnant based on testing performed at screening.

          -  Parent or legal guardian able and willing to provide signed parent permission.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of severe reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis) to transfusion of blood products.
             Individuals with minor reactions such as fever, itching, chills, etc. that resolve
             spontaneously or respond to pre-medications, and that do not represent more
             significant allergic reactions, will not be excluded.

          -  For females, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant/breastfeed during the study
             period.

          -  Participant is unlikely to adhere to the study procedures, keep appointments, or is
             planning to relocate outside the greater Los Angeles area during the study.

          -  Any condition that would, in the opinion of the principal investigator, place the
             participant at an unacceptable risk of injury or render the participant unable to meet
             the requirements of the protocol.
