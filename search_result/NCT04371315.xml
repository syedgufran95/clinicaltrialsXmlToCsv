  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient are being asked to provide respiratory and blood samples for a clinical research
      study because the patients have a virus called the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, that
      causes the disease known as Covid-19.

      Investigators do not know a lot about this virus, including all the ways it travels from
      person to person. Investigators also do not know if a person will get sick or not from the
      virus after being in close contact with someone who has the virus. Because of this,
      investigators are performing research on the virus found in respiratory secretions to get
      more information on how investigators can best detect and treat this new virus in the future.

      Primary Objective

        -  To determine the clinical characteristics and outcomes of Covid-19 in children.

        -  To characterize the clinical risk factors of Covid-19 in children..

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To characterize the immunological risk factors and serologic response to SARS-CoV-2
           infection in children.- To evaluate the duration of viral shedding in children.

        -  To evaluate the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding in children. Exploratory Objective

      Nasal swabs will be collected from positive patient participants on Day 0. Timing of
      follow-up swabs will be guided by standard of care procedures.

      Whole blood will be collected at Days 0. Follow-up blood sampling will be guided by standard
      of care procedures. Samples will be stored at -80oC.

      Nasal swabs and whole blood will only be obtained at the same time standard of care
      procedures are performed. If a patient is not getting a blood draw, no sample will be
      collected.
