  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By using recent data on hospital attendance and COVID-19 laboratory tests, available within
      two NHS trusts in Nottingham and Cardiff will enable the calculation of the risk of
      developing COVID-19 infection after attending an outpatient hospital appointment. This will
      assist in the restart planning when resuming face to face outpatient clinics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since March 2020, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has caused considerable
      disruption to the provision of routine healthcare in the UK. A key priority for healthcare
      providers when gaining control of COVID-19, is to restart the provision of urgent non-COVID
      care. There are several barriers including a reluctance for people to attend hospital
      appointments for fears of contracting COVID-19.

      The investigators will calculate the incidence of infection in approximately 18,000 patients
      at Notingham and 16,000 patients at Cardiff and calculate the risk of infection within 28
      days of attending outpatients appointments. Controls will use data on patients who attended
      the hospitals in 2019.

      The study team will utilize the data held in the electronic systems of NUH and University
      Hospital of Wales to perform a cohort and cross-sectional study. The cohort study will
      comprise both an exposed cohort and unexposed cohort.

      The exposed cohort will comprise patients who attended outpatient appointments during
      (between 1/1/2020 and 30/6/2020) and whether they subsequently developed a positive or
      negative PCR test for Sars-CoV2 result within 28-days of their attendance. The unexposed
      cohort will work as a control group, comprising individuals who attended outpatient
      appointments during the equivalent period in 2019.

      The team will also determine whether Covid-19 has influenced the rate of patients not
      attending or cancelling scheduled appointments throughout the pandemic comparing the 2020 and
      2019 data.

      Using data on patients' age, gender and nature of the appointment will enable the results to
      be recorded accordingly.

      All of this data will be retrospective, so will not require any additional data collection,
      nor will it interfere with routine clinical care. Pseudo-anonymised data will be transferred
      from University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff to Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) Trust
      via a password-protected, encrypted spreadsheet, with original patient identifiers removed,
      and a unique code assigned, that only the researcher in Cardiff can use to trace back to the
      individual, this is so all the analysis can be performed at NUH by a Nottingham based
      statistician.

      The study team consisting of clinicians, data analysts, epidemiologist and clinical
      researchers will analyse this information to quantify the risk of infection which will help
      inform the recovery plans and service provision during the restart of urgent and routine
      non-COVID care.

        All individuals attending outpatient clinics will be included for analysis, this is
        anticipated this to be in excess of 18,000 patients at NUH and around 16,000 patients at
        Cardiff. To ensure a substantive number of patients are included for analysis and
        comparison across the UK, 2 large hospitals (Nottingham University Hospitals and Cardiff
        University Hospitals) will be participating in this study.
