  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hydroxychloroquine, a derivative of chloroquine (an antimalarial drug) with a weak
      immunosuppressive effect, is prescribed by some teams alone or in combination with
      azithromycin. No randomized controlled trials have demonstrated its efficacy, particularly in
      primary care in the early stages of the disease. However, currently available data suggest
      better efficacy if treatment is given early in the disease, before symptoms worsen. To date,
      the majority of COVID-19 patients treated in outpatient care, particularly in general
      practice, represent the majority of COVID-19 patients.

      It is essential to evaluate, in primary care, the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine
      combined with azithromycin in Covid-19 patients in order to be able to implement this
      therapeutic strategy as soon as the first symptoms appear. We realize a randomized,
      controlled, open superiority trial, in 2 parallel groups (ratio 1:1).The main objective is to
      assess the efficacy of Hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin in COVID-19 patients in
      primary care, in add-on to standard of care, on unfavorable outcome defined by the onset of
      at least one of the following between D0 and D14: hospitalization, death or percutaneous O²
      saturation ≤ 92% in ambient air.

      Randomized, controlled, open superiority trial, in 2 parallel groups (ratio 1:1).

      Eligible consecutive patient will be offered to take part in the trial during a visit to
      thier GP for COVID symptoms. After verification of eligibility criteria and written informed
      consent, a nasopharyngeal swab, an ECG and a blood sampled (kalaemia, magnesemia and
      calcemia) will be performed.

      Patient with SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive result and still fulfilling eligibility criteria will be
      randomized on day2 (D2) through a web-based allocation system, following a computer generated
      allocation list, stratified on center and existence of any comorbidity, to experimental or
      control group. Patients without confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection on PCR will not continue
      the trial. Both groups patients will have a paper-based diary to record their daily symptoms
      and drug intake. A clinical follow-up will be done by the GP at D5, D8, D14 and D28.The main
      analysis population will be in intention to treat. An intermediate efficacy analysis is
      planned when 50% of patients have reached D14.

      Two hundred consecutive patients (from pre-identified centers) will be included in an
      ancillary virological study to assess evolution of viral load at D8 and D14. For these
      patients all nasopharyngeal swab will be sent to a centralised lab at Pitié-Salpêtrière
      Hospital.
