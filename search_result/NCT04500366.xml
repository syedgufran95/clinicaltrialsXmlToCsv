  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is keeping people apart, which can take a
      toll on physical and mental health. Many healthcare professionals are concerned vulnerable
      seniors may become deconditioned, which substantially increases risk of health complications
      and need for hospitalization. To address the immediate impact of COVID-19 policies (i.e.,
      physical distancing, reduced access to care), the GERAS Frailty Rehabilitation model will be
      adapted to be delivered remotely in the homes of vulnerable seniors. The investigators' aim
      is to understand how to best build resilience among vulnerable seniors in the community
      through at-home rehabilitation services (socialization, exercise, nutrition, and medication
      support).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During this unprecedented time of COVID-19, many healthcare professionals are concerned that
      vulnerable seniors who are housebound and isolated will become deconditioned resulting in
      functional losses in mental status, continence and ability to complete activities of daily
      living. Total inactivity in seniors can result in a 10-20% decrease in muscle strength per
      week (1 -3% per day). Loss of muscle strength may quickly convert a vulnerable older adult
      who was ambulatory into a bedridden state. This will affect the health of seniors and
      increase demand on healthcare systems. An innovative model to deliver frailty rehabilitation
      services remotely is urgently needed to: 1) increase access to specialized services 2)
      provide added supports for seniors discharged from the hospital who are in need of
      rehabilitation and 3) build resilience in seniors to prevent re-hospitalization or
      institutionalization. Therefore, to address the immediate impact of COVID-19 policies (i.e.,
      physical distancing and reduced access to care), the GERAS Frailty Rehabilitation model will
      be adapted to be delivered remotely in the homes of vulnerable seniors. This
      proof-of-concept, randomized control trial aims to understand how to best build resilience
      among vulnerable seniors through at-home rehabilitation services using socialization,
      exercise, nutrition, and medication support.

      The short-term immediate goals for this RCT are to help vulnerable seniors who are isolated
      because of physical distancing measures to build strength and resilience throughout the
      COVID-19 pandemic. The major deliverables are 1) the adaptation of an in-person program to
      virtual delivery 2) the piloting of a care pathway with inter-disciplinary professionals that
      can be expanded to reach a larger number of individuals.

      The long-term goal of the study is the seamless implementation of a new model for multimodal
      Frailty Rehabilitation that closes the care gap in rehabilitation for frail seniors in the
      immediate and foreseeable future.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomized into two arms (35/arm based on sample size calculation) for 12-weeks of socialization only or multi-modal frailty rehabilitation. The socialization only arm will receive 1x/week phone calls from medical student volunteers via the McMaster Student-Senior Isolation Prevention Partnership (SSIPP). Multi-modal frailty rehabilitation will involve virtual care including 1x/week socialization (SSIPP), 2x/week exercise (small group physiotherapy live-streamed sessions), nutrition (virtual dietician consult), and medication support (virtual pharmacist consult) all via a videoconferencing service.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Participants will receive twice-weekly (one hour per class) virtual exercise via small-group physiotherapy sessions for a total of 12 weeks. All exercise sessions will occur virtually via a videoconferencing system. The classes will focus on functional movements specifically designed for seniors with frailty and mobility challenges, and will include modifications for gait aids such as canes or walkers. Class sizes will be small to allow for tailoring of exercises based on challenging, safe, progressive, evidence-based exercises. In accordance with recent guidelines to achieve 3 hours/week for fall prevention practice in older adults, participants will also be provided with tailored supplemental home exercises developed by the study physiotherapist to gain an additional 1 hour of physical activity.</description>

    <description>Nutrition Consult: Participants will be scheduled for a one-on-one virtual nutrition consult with the study dietitian. During the consultation, the dietitian will assess the nutritional status of the participant and will provide them with counselling and coaching to improve their nutrition.
Protein Supplementation: As piloted in our Fit Joints Study, the protein supplement (each serving) contains 350 kcal, 20-gram protein, 1.5 g β-Hydroxy β-Methylbutyrate (HMB), and participants are advised to take this with a meal or within 3 hours of exercise on activity days.</description>
