      Background The significant risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to healthcare staff mandated
      changes to Basic and Advanced Life Support (BLS and ALS) guidelines. As advised by the
      European Resuscitation Council (ERC), healthcare staff should put on airborne-precaution
      personal protective equipment (PPE) before starting chest compressions and/or airway
      interventions, as a minimum an FFP3 mask (FFP2 or N95 if FFP3 not available), eye and face
      protection and long-sleeved gown. However, wearing FFP3 masks has been shown to highly impair
      cardiopulmonary exercise capacity and the effect of wearing PPE on the quality of
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation is not known. The aim of this project is therefore to to
      investigate whether wearing PPE has an effect on the quality of chest compressions.

      Methods The study forsees a simulated CPR scenario on manikins. Study participants are lay
      rescuers and members of the rescue organization Croce Bianca. Each participant will perform 5
      sequences consisting of 2 min of chest compressions altered by 2 min of no chest compressions
      (break), as recommended by the current ERC guidelines. The participants will perform the
      described CPR sequence two times in a cross-over design with randomized order, once while
      wearing PPE and once without wearing PPE. Between the two CPR sequences (i.e. with and
      without PPE) a break of 60 min for recovery will be given. During both CPR sequences, the
      quality of chest compressions will be measured.
