  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Brazilian version of the Clinical Characterization Protocol for Serious Emerging
      Infections (ISARIC/WHO ). This is a standardized protocol for the rapid, coordinated clinical
      investigation of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Patients with acute illness suspected to be
      caused by emerging will be enrolled. This protocol has been designed to enable data to be
      prospectively collected.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted at multiple sites (to be determined by the spread of disease and
      availability of resources). It is appreciated that settings will vary in terms of clinical
      infrastructure, resources and capacity. This study will enrol eligible patients (adults) with
      confirmed or suspected infection with a pathogen relevant to the study objectives.
      Recruitment of patients with Day 1 (enrolment) data and biological samples is the priority.

      Observational analyses will be stratified according to available data. Outcome data for
      primary and secondary objectives will be derived from data from routine clinical and
      laboratory assessments performed as part of standard inpatient medical management at the
      treating site, documented using proportionate case report forms (CRF; either paper or
      web-based electronic 'eCRF'). Clinical and laboratory data will be collected throughout the
      acute illness period according to local resources. Priority at all times will be given to the
      collection of clinical information. Research data will be integrated as much as possible with
      information available from hospital and regulatory files.
