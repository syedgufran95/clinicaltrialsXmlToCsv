      &quot;This is a prospective, single-center specimen collection study. Subjects 18 years of age or
      older who do not have symptoms of COVID-19 will be enrolled. Two nasal swab samples and one
      saliva sample will be collected from each subject. The saliva sample will be tested with the
      COVIDSeq Test and one nasal swab will be tested with an EUA approved COVID test. The other
      nasal swab sample will be stored and a subset (approximately 250 specimens) will be tested
      with the COVIDSeq Test. Results of all testing will be provided to the sponsor for
      statistical analysis.

      Results from the comparator EUA test will be provided to the collection site investigator or
      designated collection site study staff. No medical treatment, guidance on treatment
      decisions, nor medical care will be provided. &quot;
