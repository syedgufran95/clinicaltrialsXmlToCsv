  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has a high burden of morbidity and mortality due
      to development of the so-called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The
      renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) plays an important role in the development of ARDS.

      ACE2 is one of the enzymes involved in the RAS cascade. Virus spike protein binds to ACE2 to
      form a complex suitable for cellular internalization. The downregulation of ACE2 results in
      the excessive accumulation of angiotensin II, and it has been demonstrated that the
      stimulation of the angiotensin II type 1a receptor (AT1R) increases pulmonary vascular
      permeability, explaining the increased lung pathology when activity of ACE2 is decreased.
      Currently available AT1R blockers (ARBs) such as valsartan, have the potential to block this
      pathological process mediated by angiotensin II. There are presently two complementary
      mechanisms suggested: 1) ARBs block the excessive angiotensin-mediated AT1R activation, and
      2) they upregulate ACE2, which reduces angiotensin II concentrations and increases the
      production of the protective vasodilator angiotensin 1-7. In light of the above, ARBs may
      prevent the development of ARDS and avert morbidity (admission to intensive care unit (ICU)
      and mechanical ventilation) and mortality.

      Objective: To investigate the effect of the ARB valsartan in comparison to placebo on the
      occurrence of one of the following items, within 14 days of randomization:1) ICU admission;
      2) Mechanical ventilation; 3) Death.

      Study design: A double-blind, placebo-controlled 1:1 randomized clinical trial Study
      population: Adult hospitalized SARS-CoV-2-infected patients (n=651). Intervention: The
      active-treatment arm will receive valsartan in a dosage titrated to blood pressure up to a
      maximum of 160mg b.i.d. and the placebo arm will receive a matching placebo also titrated to
      blood pressure. Treatment duration will be 14 days or up to hospital discharge &lt; 14 days or
      occurrence of the primary endpoint if &lt; 14 days.

      Main study endpoint: The primary study endpoint is the occurrence within 14 days of
      randomization of either: 1) ICU admission; 2) Mechanical ventilation; 3) Death.
