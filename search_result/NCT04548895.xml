  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Solving the problem of detecting asymptomatic carriers who can transmit infection is key to
      protecting vulnerable residents of nursing homes and assisted living facilities, to
      protecting frontline workers who care for them, and to facilitating return to work (including
      return of nurses and medical assistants).

      The wearable biometric technology, if widely disseminated among vulnerable populations and
      the community-at-large, will help avoid the ravages of seasonal flu and other contagious
      illnesses, and the society will be better prepared for future waves of COVID-19 or other
      pandemics. Even if a vaccine is developed, due to immune senescence and immunocompromise,
      elderly people and those with chronic medical conditions may not be well protected by it.
      Continuous biomonitoring provides another layer of protection for them.

      1. Building the algorithm for early, pre-symptomatic DETECTION OF RESPIRATORY VIRAL
           INFECTION and for predicting eventual DETERIORATION.

        2. Create an APP that AUTOMATES these algorithms and clearly REPORTS ACTIONABLE RESULTS to
           users, i.e., to medical professionals and citizens-at-large in near-real time. If
           alerted to a possible - and likely still asymptomatic - COVID-19 infection, they can
           self-isolate or be quarantined, get confirmatory COVID-19 testing done promptly, limit
           transmission to others, and stay safe knowing that if they are likely to deteriorate,
           the algorithm will alert the participants and their caregivers to the need to obtain
           medical attention promptly.

    <description>The intervention will take place in nursing homes, assisted living facilities and long-term care facilities (LTCF) in the United States (henceforth collectively referred to as &quot;LTCF&quot;).
Staff who work in the participating LTCF ≥ 20 hours/week and who have direct contact with the residents are also eligible to participate and to employ the biometric monitoring equipment in their private residences.</description>

    <description>Emfit devices will be installed once after enrollment under each participant's mattress and left to record automatically without further intervention. The participants will wear their Biostrap wristbands consistently, ideally 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for 2 months.
A virus panel will be upon enrollment (baseline) and then every two weeks (± 3 days, or on the closest convenient sampling day if the LTCF is testing all residents on the same day) for a maximum of 5 times during the two-month period. Using polymerase chain reaction or next generation sequencing, the virus panel will detect COVID-19 and 12 other common respiratory viruses that may cause similar symptoms and similar biometric signatures. These include influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1 through 4, respiratory syncytial virus, non-COVID coronavirus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus and metapneumovirus.</description>
