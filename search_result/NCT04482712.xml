  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assesses the clinical effectiveness of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
      inhibition with rapamycin in minimizing or decreasing the severity of acute lung injury/acute
      respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) in participants infected with mild to moderate
      COVID-19 virus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial in which
      each participant, after admission to hospital with a diagnosis of mild to moderate COVID-19
      infection, will be administered either a dose of rapamycin or the placebo daily. Each subject
      will receive the assigned treatment until hospital discharge or death. Evaluations will be
      performed at the beginning of the clinical trial and then daily up to 4 weeks.
