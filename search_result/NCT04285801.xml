  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 2019 novel-coronavirus (2019-nCov) is the cause of a cluster of unexplained pneumonia
      that started in Hubei province in China 1. It has manifest into a global health crisis with
      escalating confirmed cases and spread across 15 countries. Whilst it is currently an epidemic
      in China, The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Level risk assessment is set at high 2.

      Sequencing showed that 2019-nCov is similar to bat severe acute syndrome (SARS)-related
      coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats 3. This is compatible with the initial
      epidemiological link with a local wet market which sells bats. Furthermore, data sharing and
      sequencing data has facilitated development of accurate diagnostic tests.

      In contrast, our current understanding of the epidemiological and clinical features of
      2019-nCov is limited. In a case series of 41 hospitalized patients with confirmed infection,
      at least 30% of these patients required critical care admission. These patients developed
      severe respiratory failure and 10% required mechanical ventilation and 5% needed
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. More worryingly 2019-nCov infection was
      associated with 15% mortality. Although these figures are likely overestimates due to
      unreported mild cases, there is currently no effective treatment. The optimal supportive care
      for patients with severe 2019-nCov infection is a research priority.

      The spread of the 2019-nCov epidemic to Hong Kong has started. Patients have been admitted to
      the Intensive Care Unit for multiorgan dysfunction. Currently there are no published data
      focused specifically on critically ill patients with nCov infection. The purpose of this case
      series is to describe the characteristics, organ dysfunction and support and 2 week outcomes
      of critically ill patients with nCov infection.
