      Primary Objective:

      To assess the effect of hydroxychloroquine versus placebo on nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral
      load in outpatient adults with COVID-19

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the effect of hydroxychloroquine versus placebo on clinical signs and symptoms
           and progression of disease in outpatient adults with COVID-19

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of hydroxychloroquine in outpatient adults with
           COVID-19

      The duration of the study per participant will be around 18 days (1 or 2 days of screening
