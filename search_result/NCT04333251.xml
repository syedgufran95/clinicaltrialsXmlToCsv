  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently there are no proven treatment option for COVID-19. Human convalescent plasma is an
      option for COVID-19 treatment and could be available from people who have recovered and can
      donate plasma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Experience from prior outbreaks with other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-1 shows that
      convalescent plasma contains neutralizing antibodies to the relevant virus. In the case of
      SARS-CoV-2, the anticipated mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy would
      mediate protection is viral neutralization. The only antibody type that is currently
      available for immediate use is that found in human convalescent plasma. As more individuals
      contract COVID-19 and recover, the number of potential donors will continue to increase. The
      investigators seek to treat participants who are sick enough to warrant hospitalization prior
      to the onset of overwhelming disease.
