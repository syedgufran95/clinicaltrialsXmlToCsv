  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in our country, individuals over 65 are prohibited from leaving
      their homes by T.C. The Ministry of Internal Affairs on March 21, 2020. While social
      isolation provides protection from COVID-19, it also brings some side effects that pose
      health risks. Studies investigating the relationship between social isolation and health
      behavior report that individuals with smaller social networks report less healthy diets,
      excessive alcohol consumption, and less physical activity. The effects of social isolation
      are related to physical inactivity, smoking.

      Physical activity is any body movement produced by the contraction of skeletal muscles that
      increases energy consumption. 150 minutes of moderate PA, 75 minutes of severe PA per week,
      or combined moderate and severe intensity PA plus twice a week strength training is
      recommended for elderly. The prevalence of physical inactivity increases significantly with
      increasing age. At the global level, approximately 45% of people over the age of 60 do not
      meet the recommended level of PA. The decrease in physical performance is associated with the
      risk of falling, sarcopenia, fragility, decreased quality of life, emotionalization,
      comorbidity, early death, and increased health care costs.

      The purpose of this study; to evaluate the physical activity level, functional capacity and
      quality of life of individuals over the age of 65 who socially isolated due to the
      precautions COVID-19 pandemic, and to investigate the effectiveness of video based home
      exercise program.

    <textblock>
      94 volunteers over 65 years old who are at home during the social isolation process due to
      the coronavirus outbreak will be included in the study. Participants will be divided into 2
      groups of 47 people. 47 volunteers over 65 years old who are at home during the social
      isolation process due to the coronavirus outbreak will be included in home exercise group. A
      video exercise protocol was created and each exercise session was planned as daily 30 minutes
      for 6 weeks. Individuals will ask to do their exercises. It was planned to start the protocol
      with warm-up exercises and finish with cooling exercises. The exercise protocol was
      additionally determined as a combination of aerobic, balance and strengthening exercises. The
      exercise program consists of 3 levels and individuals will be provided to start at a level
      appropriate to their level of physical activity. The control group will be asked to remain
      isolated as they are and the exercise program will not be implemented.

      Evaluation methods will be applied before starting the exercise program and at the end of 6
      weeks.

    <measure>Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly will use to assess the physical activity level of elderly individuals, the factors affecting the activity level, the relationship between physical activity and health profile. The minimum and maximum score that can be obtained from the scale is 0 and 400.The higher score indicates better level of physical activity.</description>

    <measure>Nottingham Health Profile</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Nottingham Health Profile will use to assess the quality of life related to health. It is a general quality of life questionnaire that assesses the level of individuals' health problems and how they affect their daily life activities. It have six subtitles, scored between 0-100. The high total score indicates that the health condition is bad.</description>

    <measure>Short Physical Performance Battery</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Short Physical Performance Battery will use to assess physical performance. This test consists of 3 objective tests that evaluate lower body function; 4 meters walking, getting up from the chair and standing balance test. 5-step (0-4) summary score is assigned for each test; higher scores show better physical performance.</description>

    <measure>Beck anxiety inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Beck anxiety inventory will use to assess anxiety level. The survey includes substances that determine anxious temperament, autonomic hyperactivity and motor tension, some cognitions. The patient is asked to evaluate the symptoms within the 'last week including today'. Each symptom is evaluated as none, mild, moderate, and severe. The total score ranges from 0-63.</description>
