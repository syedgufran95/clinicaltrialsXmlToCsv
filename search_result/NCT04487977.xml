      The objectives of this study are to analyze the best device for intubation in patients
      infected by SARS-CoV2 virus during COVID-19 pandemics and to review the optimal methods for
      airway management in such patients for elective surgery and in the Critical Care environment.
      Also, the safest methods for airway management in thoracic surgery will be analyzed.

      This study has a descriptive design with no hypothesis contrast, and it will explore the
      current picture in airway management in Spain. It is a multicentric international study, for
      all the centers where intubations of tracheostomies have been performed in patients diagnosed
      with SARS-CoV2 with positive PCR, either in the Critical Care setting or the operating room.

      A survey will be distributed among professionals who have been involved in airway management
      in COVID-19 patients in the following specialties: Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine,
      Emergency Medicine, Prehospital Medicine, Cardiology and Pulmonology.

      The study started on april 2020 after receiving approval from the Ethics Committee (General
      University Hospital of Valencia) COVID-19 infection causes respiratory failure needing
      ventilatory support, which required endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy. This situation
      poses a significant risk of transmission due to its usual urgent nature, and it often happens
      in the context of respiratory claudication. For this reason, studying the safest and useful
      methods for airway management in this kind of patients, using data based on the clinical
      experience, may be of great interest in the future.

      Statistical analysis will be performed using Statistical Software R, . Technical
      characteristics will be described using frequencies and percentages for categorical
      variables, and means and standard deviations or medians and interquartile ranges for
      continuous variables, depending on normality tests. Base characteristics, center and years of
      experience will be compared.

      A sample size calculation is not necessary, since it is an explorative and voluntary study,
      trying to establish which are the regular routines in airway management in COVID-19 patients
      in Spain and Latin America.

      1. Justification There are no studies about safety and effectiveness of different airway
           management procedures in COVID-19 patients in Spain or Latin America.

           Due to the emergent nature of this disease, there are very few solid and universal
           publications about safety or validated protocols in SARS-CoV-2 disease airway
           management.

           In the last months, and following the clinical experience coming from China and Italy,
           we have been able to see how SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused severe morbidity or death in
           thousands of patients. In this line, and considering the high transmission rate of this
           disease, we observe how professionals from these countries have performed airway
           management to provide proper ventilation and oxygenation, in either potentially
           critically ill patients or in a surgical context. Their experience has allowed other
           countries to develop specific protocols, and to quickly adapt them to the updates that
           keep happening daily.

           For this reason, we want to explore the Spanish and Latin American experience in airway
           management. It is important to draw conclusions not only from the preparations and
           technical approaches, but also the information stemming from the context in which the
           procedure is performed, the stress derived from the risk of transmission and the
           personal protective equipment, as well as the particular difficulties they add to the
           technique.

        2. Hypothesis: Since it is a descriptive study, there is no formal hypothesis in this work.

           Objectives

        3. Objectives:

           3.1. Main objective: To analyze the preferred device for intubation in patients infected
           by SARS-CoV2 virus during COVID-19 pandemics using a survey addressed to health care
           professionals experienced in assistance to COVID-19 patients. The preferred device will
           be rated using an ordinal scoring scale and it will be presented as the device with the
           highest score.

           3.2. Secondary objectives: To assess the preferred methods for airway management in
           COVID-19 patients in a Critical Care setting or undergoing urgent or elective surgery.

        4. Design: Descriptive design with no hypothesis contrast, exploring the current panorama
           in airway management in Spain and Latin America.

        5. Ambit: Multicenter and international for Spain and Latin America, for all the health
           care centers where intubations or tracheostomies have been performed in COVID-19
           patients with a positive PCR, either in the Critical Care setting or in the operating
           room.

        6. Study population: The study population will consist of all the health care professionals
           who have been or are currently involved in airway management in COVID-19 positive
           patients, from the following medical specialties: Anesthesiology and Critical Care
           Medicine, Emergency Medicine, Pre-Hospital Medicine, Cardiology, Pulmonology.

           the Internet, created with Microsoft Forms ®. Microsoft Forms ® is a digital platform
           with a free access plan which allows quick and development of digital surveys with no
           need for programming. It also includes a set of tools to distribute and gather the
           results from the questionnaires. The survey is accessed from a link sent via e-mail or
           other digital distribution methods to the potential participants.

        9. Interventions and procedures: There is no need for interventions on patients or their
           clinical records. A single intervention will take place on the participants in the

           variables.

       10. Sample size calculation: There is no need for sample size calculation, since the study
           is explorative and voluntary, trying to assess clinical routines in airway management.

       11. Statistical plan: Statistical analysis will be performed using Statistical Software R, .
           Technical characteristics will be described using frequencies and percentages for
           categorical variables, and means and standard deviations or medians and interquartile
           ranges for continuous variables, depending on normality tests. Base characteristics,
           center and years of experience will be compared. Proper figures will be presented to
           represent the results about which are the most used techniques and devices, as well as
           the most important features of every procedure.

       12. Ethical considerations:

      12.1. General considerations: The study is to be conducted according to this protocol,
      Helsinki Ethical Principles Declaration and currently existing directives.

      12.2. Informed consent: An informed consent form is not necessary, since the survey will be
      completed by professionals who provided care to the patients in a retrospective manner, with
      no diagnostic or therapeutic interventions. Besides, since it is a retrospective study with
      anonymous data, there is no possibility to ask for an informed consent to the patients. For
      these reasons, an exemption for informed consent was requested and accepted by the Ethics
      Committee.

      12.3. Data protection: Data from the participants will be managed according to existing
      spanish and european laws (Spanish Law 3/2018 on Personal Data Protection and Digital Rights
      Warranty, and EU Regulation UE 2016/679). Gathered data for the study will be identified with
      a code, and the information will not include identificatory details of the participants, thus
      not being able to reveal their identities. Names of patients will not be collected or
      presented in any publication or communication of the study results.
