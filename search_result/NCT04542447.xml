  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A two arm open label multi-centered randomized interventional trial is proposed to assess
      aspects of safety and efficacy of Nuvastatic™ (Serial No: C5OSEW5050ESA) . Two parallel
      groups of (1:1) ratio comparing Nuvastatic™ versus standard care will be conducted on
      patients on oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 94% or less while they are breathing ambient air or a
      ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2)
      (PaO2:FiO2) at or below 300 mg Hg.

      Primary Outcome Measures: time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from
      randomization to an improvement of two points (from the status at randomization) on a
      seven-category ordinal scale or live discharge from the hospital, whichever comes first.

      Secondary Outcome Measures: Clinical status as assessed with the seven-category ordinal scale
      on days 7 and 14, mortality at day 28.

        1. The duration of mechanical ventilation.

        2. The duration of hospitalization in survivors.

        3. The time (in days) from treatment initiation to death.

        4. Virologic measures included the proportions with viral RNA detection over time and viral
           RNA titer area under-curve (auc) measurements.

      This study will propose Nuvastiatic™ as a new lead therapeutic agent for SARS-CoV-2, and new
      insights for currently ongoing clinical trials to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections. Nuvastatic™
      could be used as potential anti-coronavirus therapy that acts on the human immune system or
      human cells as an immune modulator, and the other on coronavirus itself as an antiviral
      agent. In terms of the human immune system, the innate immune system response plays an
      important role in controlling the replication and infection of coronavirus, and interferon
      gamma, interleukins, Th cells, granulocyte macrophage are expected to enhance the immune
      response.
