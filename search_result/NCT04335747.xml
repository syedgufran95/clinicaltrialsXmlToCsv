      The trial is a prospective, observational study aiming to identify risk factors for serious
      COVID-19 infection by evaluating clinical measures and biomarkers of inflammation in patients
      with inflammatory rheumatic disease hospitalized with COVID-19 compared with control groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pandemic caused by the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-19, has severely affected health care
      systems around the world. In Denmark, more than 85,000 patients have a diagnosis of
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus
      erythematosus (SLE), or giant cell arthritis, and many are treated with immunosuppressive
      therapy including biologics.

      At present it is unclear whether the best course of action during a viral pandemic is to
      pause treatment with biologics, change to drugs with a different mode of action or continue
      treatment as usual.

      Many patients with RA and SLE receive hydroxychloroquine (HCL) treatment for their rheumatic
      disease, but HCL has also been suggested as a potential treatment for COVID-19 infection.

      This trial aim to identify risk factors for serious COVID-19 infection by evaluating clinical
      measures and biomarkers of inflammation, including IL6 and IL10 in patients with inflammatory
      rheumatic disease hospitalized with COVID-19 compared with measures in control groups.
