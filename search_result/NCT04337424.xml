  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 is a highly contagious infectious disease. Symptoms of
      the disease are non-specific (fever, cough, dyspnea and fatigue), common with many seasonal
      viruses, which complicates the diagnosis. For mild forms, which represent the vast majority
      of cases, hospitalization is not necessary and treatment is symptomatic. However in more
      severe cases, hospitalization is required and sometimes even admission to an intensive care
      unit.

      Several diagnostic tests are already available, but they require, in all cases, the
      intervention of qualified health personnel to carry out the sample, which includes a risk of
      contagion and an expensive and time-consuming laboratory analysis and reagents. These tests
      are therefore not very suitable for massive screenings.

      We want to evaluate the performance of a detection test performed on a salivary sample in the
      diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. This test will be non-invasive, performed without any analytical
      device and will restore its qualitative result &quot;infected versus non-infected&quot; in less than 1
      hour (30min objective).

      Study taking place at the Montpellier University Hospital, comparing a salivary sample group
      tested positive (patients) for SARS-COV2 with a salavary sample tested negative for SARS-COV2
      (healthcare workers supposed to be negative)
