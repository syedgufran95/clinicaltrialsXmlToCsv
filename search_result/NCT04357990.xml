  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Viruxal Oral and Nasal Spray is a Class I CE marked medical device manufactured by Kerecis hf
      (the &quot;Device&quot;). A double blind clinical trial will be conducted to evaluate the Device
      against placebo in COVID-19 positive, symptomatic patients in Iceland. Immediate access to
      COVID-19 patients is available through a well-organized COVID-19 outpatient follow-up clinic.
      Up to 128 patients with mild to moderate symptoms of COVID-19 will be recruited (so called
      &quot;higher end of the low risk group&quot;). These patients will be positive for COVID-19, be
      symptomatic with upper respiratory symptoms, but without involvement of the entire
      respiratory system. The patients will be randomized to receive treatment with the Study
      Device or to receive placebo. 64 patients will be randomized into the Study Device group and
      64 patients into the Control group. Patients will administer Study Device or Control for 14
      days and will have their symptoms recorded until no further symptoms are reported, up to a
      maximum of 28 days follow-up.
