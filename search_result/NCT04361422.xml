      Abstract:

      The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-COV-2 has infected over 2,000,000 people causing over
      150,000 deaths. A key host cellular protein required for the virus entry is
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) whose expression has been demonstrated in many tissues
      including alveolar epithelial type II cells in lungs, oral mucosa and intestine, heart,
      kidney, endothelium and skin. ACE2-expressing cells can act as home cells and are prone to
      SARS-CoV-2 infection as ACE2 receptor facilitates cellular viral entry and replication. (1)
      Fang et al. has suggested that patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus may be at
      higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as these patients are often treated with ACE inhibitors
      (ACEIs) or angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs), which have been previously
      suggested to increase ACE2 expression. (2) In another study by Sinha et al who analyzed a
      publicly available Connectivity Map (CMAP) dataset of pre/post transcriptomic profiles for
      drug treatment in cell lines for over 20,000 small molecules, isotretinoin was the strongest
      down-regulator of ACE 2 receptors. On the other hand, they found 6 drugs in CMAP that are
      currently being investigated in clinical trials for treating COVID-19 (chloroquine,
      thalidomide, methylprednisolone, losartan, lopinavir and ritonavir, from clinicaltrials.gov),
      none of which was found to significantly alter ACE2 expression (P&gt;0.1) (3) Moreover, Wu et
      al, demonstrated that isotretinoin is a Potential papain like protease (PLpro) inhibitors
      which is a protein encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes and considered one of the proteins that should
      be targeted in COVID-19 treatment by performing target-based virtual ligand screening. (4) In
      addition, isotretinoin was reported to increase CD4 counts and markedly decrease viremia in
      HIV positive patients suffering from acne vulgaris. (5) Currently, a study is running to
      evaluate the effect of isotretinoin on immune activation among HIV-1 infected subjects with
      incomplete CD4+ T cell recovery. (6) From this point, we can suggest that patient taking
      isotretinoin therapy may be immune against SARS-COV-2 and it can also have a therapeutic
      effect by prevention of further progression of the virus. Several potential mechanisms of
      action of Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 have been postulated and they are
      actually used in treatment regimens for COVID-19.(7) It was reported that chloroquine
      increase the blood level of isotretinoin, so lower doses is required when combined. We assume
      to test the efficacy of isotretinoin in treatment of COVID-19 versus combined therapy with
      the standard treatment of COVID-19.

      The study is a randomized interventional comparative Phase III trial. The duration of the
      trial for each subject is expected to be 3 months. The duration for each individual subject
      includes one-month study treatment and 3 months follow-up time. Recruitment of subjects will
      start in April 2020.

      150 adult male and female patients with positive COVID-19 diagnosis and fulfilling the below
      outlined inclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study. Trial population will consist of
      both genders.

      Name of tested drug: Isotretinoin. All consenting adult patients having confirmed COVID-19
      will be recruited and randomly and blindly allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to the following arms:

      Group (1): 50 patients will receive isotretinoin 0.5 mg/kg/day for one month or until viral
      clearance.

      Group (2): 50 patients will receive standard therapy for COVID-19 (Paracetamol 500 mg /6h,
      Hydroxychloroquine 500 mg/ 12h, Oseltamivir 150 mg /12 h for 5 days, Azithromycin 1 gm first
      day then 500 mg/day for 1st line or Clarithromycin 500 mg/12 h for 7-14 days, Ascorbic acid
      500 mg/12 h and Cyanocobalamin IV once daily plus Lopinavir 400mg/Ritonavir 100 mg caps 2
      capsules twice daily in severe cases).

      Group (3): 50 patients will receive standard therapy for COVID-19 + isotretinoin 0.25
      mg/kg/day for one month or until viral clearance.

      Inclusion Criteria:

        -  Clinical and laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19.

        -  Age range 18-40

      Exclusion Criteria:

      • Have the following conditions:

        1. Hypercholesterolemia

        2. Hypertriglyceridemia

        3. Liver disease

        4. Renal disease

        5. Sjögren syndrome

        6. Pregnancy

        7. Lactation

        8. Depressive disorder

        9. Contraindications for hormonal contraception or intrauterine device.
