  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this research is to determine whether Valproate alone, and in
      combination with Quetiapine, lowers confusion and agitation in persons with severe Corona
      Virus Disease (COVID)19 pneumonia during weaning from the breathing machine (ventilator).
      Though Valproate and Quetiapine are often given to persons with severe confusion with
      agitation, the purpose of this small research study is specifically for: a) persons infected
      with COVID 2019 on a ventilator whose agitation is not responding to the usual medications
      (like dexmedetomidine), and b) to reduce the time persons are treated with dexmedetomidine,
      which requires continuous close monitoring in an ICU.

      This is a pilot feasibility study involving a randomized, single-blind, controlled comparison
      scheme examining the efficacy and safety of standard of care (n=10) combined with valproate
      alone, and in combination with quetiapine (N=10) , in order to reduce the magnitude of
      agitation associated with COVID 19 delirium as assessed by the RASS scale when weaning from a
      ventilator, and reduce need for dexmedetomidine as assessed by number of doses of
      dexmedetomidine administered.
