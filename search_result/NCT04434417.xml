  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In COVID-19 pandemic, it is of critical importance to identify a rapid and simple diagnostic
      method to be used in clinical settings to timely inform and refine strategies that can
      prevent, control, and stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test
      Cassette (Whole Blood/Serum/Plasma) is a qualitative, membrane-based immunoassay for the
      detection of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in
      whole blood, serum or plasma specimen. Clinical specimens from patients who were suspected of
      being infected with 2019-nCoV will be used to evaluate the performance of the assay.

      In COVID-19 pandemic, it is of critical importance to identify a rapid and simple diagnostic
      method to be used in clinical settings to timely inform and refine strategies that can
      prevent, control, and stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test
      Cassette (Whole Blood/Serum/Plasma) is a qualitative, membrane-based immunoassay for the
      detection of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to SARS-CoV-2in
      whole blood, serum or plasma specimen. This test consists of two components, an IgG component
      and an IgM component. In the IgG component, anti-human IgG is coated in IgG test line region.
      During testing, the specimen reacts with 2019-nCoV antigen-coated particles in the test
      cassette. The mixture then migrates upward on the membrane chromatographically by capillary
      action and reacts with the anti-human IgG in IgG test line region, if the specimen contains
      IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The study aims to validate in a real life study a self
      diagnostic assay for SARS-CoV-2 with the advantages of high speed, simple operation and low
      cost, and overcomes the shortcomings of the existing molecular detection methods. Clinical
      specimens from patients who were suspected of being infected with 2019-nCoV will be used to
      evaluate the performance of the assay. In parallel, we will also use molecular assays for the
      detection of the presence of the viral RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs since Polymerase Chain
      Reaction is currently the gold standard.

        Study population includes:

          -  Patients or health professionals already tested positive for the viral RNA from
             nasopharyngeal swabs by RT-PCR

          -  Patients or health professional who are suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 in
             the hospital

          -  Patients who are considered at high risk for infection and eligible for active therapy

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Suspected cases who meet the following 2 criteria at the same time:

               1. Epidemiological history: There was a history of contact with confirmed cases
                  before the onset of illness; or subjects with at least one symptom in the last
                  week before accrual in the trial. Subjects who have been in contact with people
                  positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the previous 14 days.

               2. Clinical manifestations are defined as :

             Fever &gt;37.5°; dry cough, muscle pain and/or fatigue, anosmia, subjects with
             respiratory distress (Respiratory Rate &gt;25/min or O2 Saturation &lt;92%) or imaging
             characteristics of pneumonia; or the total number of white blood cells is normal or
             decreased with the lymphocyte count decreased in the early stage of onset or there is
             an abnormal C-Reactive protein. Other symptoms that clinical investigator will relate
             to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subject or cancer patients who have been quarantined for
             suspect symptoms and have access to hospital to continue therapy or to receive major

             meeting the criteria for suspected cases, sputum, throat swabs, lower respiratory
             tract secretions, and other specimens are tested by realtime RT-PCR for positive
             nucleic acid detection of new coronavirus; or viral gene sequencing is highly
             homologous with known new coronaviruses. Patients positive are serially tested with
             SARS-CoV-2 lgM / IgG Rapid Test to evaluate the immune response in IgG negative
             patients and the reliability of the test in those patients who develop clinical signs
             of SARS-CoV-2 during the trial.
