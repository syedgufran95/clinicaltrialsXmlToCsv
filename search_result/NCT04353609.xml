  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since December 2019, an international outbreak of respiratory illnesses caused by SARS-CoV-2
      called covid-19 has become a global challenge. In France, while the first cases were reported
      in January, more than 20 000 cases were confirmed at end of March. Early estimations from
      epidemiological data seem to show that 18-20% of patients with confirmed covid-19 are
      admitted in an intensive care unit (ICU). Patients with chronic inflammatory rheumatism,
      auto-immune or auto-inflammatory rare and non-rare diseases are susceptible to severe
      covid-19 (i.e ICU) due to the specific therapeutic management of their illness
      (corticosteroid, immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory drugs,..). No data are available for
      this particular population in France.

      This retrospective multicentre observational study aims to evaluate the frequency of severe
      forms of covid-19 and risk factors associated with specific outcomes in covid-19 in patients
      with chronic inflammatory rheumatism, auto-immune or auto-inflammatory rare and non-rare
      diseases.
