  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pragmatic, randomized, open-label, incomplete factorial with nested randomization
      clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of two potential treatments for
      hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants who are hospitalized
      and have a positive nucleic acid amplification test for SARS-CoV-2 will undergo an initial
      randomization in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following regimens:

      Arm 1: Standard of care alone

      Arm 2: Standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine

      Participants who meet eligibility criteria to receive azithromycin will undergo a second
      randomization in a 1:1 ratio to receive additional concurrent therapy. This will effectively
      result in four treatment groups:

        1. Standard of care alone

        2. Standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine

        3. Standard of care plus azithromycin

        4. Standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin
