  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current pilot study will explore the optimal cost-effective treatment configuration for
      online group-based weight control by focusing on two aspects of our existing treatment
      program which have significant associated cost and determine which contribute meaningfully to
      weight loss outcomes. Specifically, we will explore whether adding synchronous group social
      support (weekly group video chat sessions facilitated by a trained weight loss counselor) to
      on demand (asynchronous) social support provided through the program discussion board
      significantly increases weight losses achieved. We will also examine whether detailed
      feedback on dietary and physical activity self-monitoring records from a counselor enhances
      weight loss outcomes in comparison with basic feedback. Finally, we will examine the cost
      efficiency of the treatment constellations. Further, this pilot study will also explore the
      feasibility of recruiting participants nationally (rather than just locally) and the capture
      of data electronically (including body weight measurements) without any in-person contact.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will receive the same online group-based weight loss program, a lifestyle
      intervention which we have demonstrated to be effective in the past. The 16-session,
      goal-driven behavioral weight control program offers weekly interactive modules that provide
      evidence-based health education on caloric balance and physical activity increases, with a
      goal of fostering changes in diet and exercise habits and producing weight losses of 5-10%.
      The intervention is based on social cognitive theory and uses a self-regulation approach to
      learning new lifestyle habits that can produce and maintain weight loss. Participants in all
      study arms will be provided with the same calorie and physical activity goals, and all
      participants will be asked to self-monitor their dietary intake and physical activity daily
      using an app on their smart phone. They will also be asked to weigh themselves daily,
      consistent with research indicating that daily weighing is associated with greater weight
      loss and participants will be provided with a Bluetooth-enabled &quot;smart scale&quot; that will
      communicate weight to the password-protected study website (visible to only the participant
      and study staff). The study website also provides the dynamic programmatic content, real time
      graphic feedback from self-monitoring (for each individual participant) and a study group
      discussion board for asynchronous group interactions and social support. The website includes
      the core aspects of the behavioral program and is to be provided to all participants.

    <intervention_model_description>A 2x2 randomized controlled pilot study will be conducted which randomly allocates up to 120 individuals with overweight or obesity to an online weight control program and varies whether they receive asynchronous social support (discussion board) vs synchronous plus asynchronous social support (weekly video chat + discussion board) and varies whether the type of feedback which they receive on their self-monitoring (detailed vs basic) in a factorial study. All participants will receive the core 16-week online interactive behavioral weight loss program (iREACH) and will be followed for 4 months with monthly surveys and weight ascertainment.</intervention_model_description>
