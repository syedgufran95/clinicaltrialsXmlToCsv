  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tropism virus transmitted through droplets
      emitted into the environment of infected persons. The symptoms can be extremely varied and
      the course can range from spontaneous healing without sequelae to death.

      Currently, the diagnosis of certainty for resuscitation patients (by definition &quot;severe&quot;) is
      based on searching for a fragment of virus genetic material within the epithelial cells of
      the respiratory tree, up and/or down, by PCR.

      It is to be expected that the epidemic peak will make it difficult (if not impossible) to
      respect the stereotypical path that is currently in place, due to the lack of space in the
      specific unit. This will require optimization of care pathways and use of the specific
      sectors.

      It is therefore necessary to define the simple criteria, available from the moment patients
      are admitted, to predict the result of the COVID-19 PCR.

    <time_frame>during ICU stay, up to 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>the SOFA assessment is used to track a person's risk status during stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The score is based on six different scores, one each for the respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal, and neurological systems. Each organ system is assigned a point value from 0 (normal) to 4 (high degree of dysfunction/failure).</description>

    <description>APS II was designed to measure the severity of disease for patients admitted to Intensive care units 24 hours after admission to the ICU, the measurement has been completed and resulted in an integer point score between 0 and 163 and a predicted mortality between 0% and 100%.</description>

    <description>The DIC Score was developed by the The International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH.) The DIC score calculator accounts of the following four parameters.Each of the four parameters evaluated above have values that are weighted with a number of points varying from 0 to 3. By summing the points given to the choices, a final result between 0 and 8 is obtained</description>
