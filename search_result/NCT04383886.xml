  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, Emergency Department (ED) are in front line for the
      reception of patients presenting COVID-19 symptoms and have to face a new situation given the
      expected number of patients. Staff participate in suspect patients triage, in the diagnosis
      and the management of Covid-19 patients, having to follow the instructions and
      recommendations that evolve in real time, depending on the stage, resources and means
      available. This situation requires that the staff immediately adaptation within this
      reorganization and redeployment of the activity. Then; they are subject to many stress and
      anxiety factors such as:

        -  Increased activity: massive influx of patients, overload of work, lack of material and
           human resources

        -  Modification of practices: training in procedures, measures isolation and prevention of
           contamination of other patients, replacement by professionals reassigned from other
           departments

        -  Ethical dilemma: decisions to be made in an emergency, patient prioritization

        -  Numerous, evolving information, from various sources and sometimes contradictory
           (national, governance, service, media)

        -  Individual: fear of personal contamination and of those close to you, personal
           organization in a situation of confinement of the population, loss of usual social
           support

        -  Anxiety and stress management of patients and relatives, their entourage and colleagues
           In this study, it is proposed to study the psychic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
           emergency department staff.
