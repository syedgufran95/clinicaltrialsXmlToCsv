  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this open label, randomized, study is to obtain information on the safety and
      efficacy of 80 ppm Nitric Oxide given in addition to the standard of care of patients with
      COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nitric Oxide (NO) is a small endogenously produced molecule recognized to play a critical
      role in the function of several body systems including the vasodilatation of smooth muscle,
      neurotransmission, regulation of wound healing and inhibition of pathogens. In-vitro studies
      have shown that NO inhibits the replication cycle of the severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus (SARS CoV) in vitro. The suggested mechanisms of actions of NO on SARS are an
      effect on the fusion between the S protein and its cognate receptor, ACE2, and reduction in
      viral RNA production in the early steps of viral replication. The primary aim of this
      feasibility study is to investigate the safety of intermittent NO, delivered via inhalation,
      in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The primary endpoint in the study will be time to
      deterioration of respiratory symptoms determined by escalation to either non-invasive
      ventilation (NIV), high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), or intubation.
