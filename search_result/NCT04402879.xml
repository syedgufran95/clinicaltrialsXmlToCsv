  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine whether Prone Positioning (PP) improves outcomes
      for non-intubated hospitalized patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19,
      who are not candidates for mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The investigators hypothesize
      that PP will reduce in-hospital mortality or discharge to hospice, compared with usual care
      for non-intubated patients with do-not-intubate goals of care with hypoxemic respiratory
      failure due to probable COVID-19.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As part of the management of COVID-19 related severe ARDS, the World Health Organization
      (WHO) recommends prone positioned mechanical ventilation. At this time, it is unclear whether
      there is a role for prone positioning (PP) of non-mechanically ventilated patients.

      The objective of this trial is to determine whether PP improves outcomes for non-intubated
      hospitalized patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19, who are not
      candidates for mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The investigators hypothesize that PP will
      reduce in-hospital mortality or discharge to hospice, compared with usual care for
      non-intubated patients with do-not-intubate goals of care with hypoxemic respiratory failure
      due to probable COVID-19.

      Patients randomized to the intervention arm will continue with prone positioning until study
      inclusion criteria are no longer met, discharge from hospital, day 60 in hospital, or until
      death or discharge to hospice. Daily assessments will occur until day 60 or until the patient
      is discharged from hospital or is deceased. The investigators anticipate recruitment to be
      completed within 12 months of starting the trial.

A Serious Adverse Event (AE) is any unfavourable medical finding (including clinically significant laboratory tests) at any dose that:
