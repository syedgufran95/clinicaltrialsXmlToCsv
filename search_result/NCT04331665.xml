  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of the drug ruxolitinib in
      people diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia by determining the number of people whose conditions
      worsen (requiring machines to help with breathing or needing supplemental oxygen) while
      receiving the drug.

      This is a sub-study of the U-DEPLOY study: UHN Umbrella Trial Defining Coordinated Approach
      to Pandemic Trials of COVID-19 and Data Harmonization to Accelerate Discovery. U-DEPLOY helps
      to facilitate timely conduct of studies across the University Health Network and other
      centers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multifocal interstitial pneumonia is the most common cause of deterioration in people with
      COVID-19. This is attributed to a severe reaction where releases too many cytokines (proteins
      that play an important role in immune responses) which rush into the lungs resulting in lung
      inflammation and fluid buildup. This can lead to damage to the lungs and leading to breathing
      problems. Ruxolitinib when given early in the disease, may prevent the overproduction of
      cytokines which, in turn, may prevent lung damage.
