  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Covid-19, a commonly severe respiratory tract infection caused by the SARS-CoV2 Coronavirus,
      poses an increasing threat to individual health and health care systems. The individual
      disease course ranges from mild to life threatening, the pandemic spread leads to a shortage
      of health care resources including intensive care availability. It should be the overarching
      goal to allocate sparse health care resources to those most at need and to simultaneously
      avoid unnecessary blocking of resources by clinically unjustified hospitalizations.

      Individuals with preexisting cardiovascular conditions are at the highest risk of health
      deterioration, even at younger age. Objective criteria for hospitalization are not
      immediately available in a outpatient settings. Hence, hospitalization and emergency medical
      contact is often triggered by subjectively interpreted symptoms. The goal of this project is
      thus to improve the availability of objective measurements in the outpatient setting by means
      of an innovative, smartwatch mediated telemedicine approach.

      To achieve this goal, the investigators will conduct a randomized clinical trial comparing a
      smartwatch based telemedicine intervention with standard of care. The intervention group will
      receive regular objective measurements of heart rate, ECG, and SpO2 and will get access to a
      24/7 medical care hotline for consultation. The investigators hypothesize that the
      intervention group will benefit by a significant reduction in unnecessary hospitalizations
      and unplanned emergency medicine contacts.
