  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Few studies have reported the efficacy of HCQ in reducing the viral load and improving the
      severity of symptoms in hospitalized COVID-19 cases with serious respiratory infection.
      However, the prophylactic benefits of HCQ has not been clearly defined yet.

      This study is designed to evaluate the prophylactic efficacy of HCQ in COVID-19 cases with
      mild to moderate symptoms and in the hospital staff engaged in attending infected patients.
