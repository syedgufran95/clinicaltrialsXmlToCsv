  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plasma therapy using convalescent plasma has been shown to be effective in severe acute
      respiratory syndrome, Ebola virus infection and in H1N1 influenza. More recently there has
      been a report of the use of convalescent plasma in the treatment of 5 ventilated COVID-19
      patients with the suggestion of expedited recovery as the patients improved 1 week after the
      transfusion. However, this was not a clinical trial and the patients were on other antiviral
      medication.; therefore, there is a need to undertake such a trial to see if deploying plasma
      with SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody has utility in managing patients infected with COVID-19
      in respiratory distress.

      The objective of this pilot study is to compare plasma therapy using convalescent plasma with
      antibody against SARS-CoV-2 to usual supportive therapy in COVID-19 patients with pneumonia
      and hypoxia, and to determine if the clinical course is improved. The difference between
      groups will allow an effect size to be determined for a definitive clinical trial.

    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has developed into a pandemic with serious global public
      health and economic sequelae. As of March 30, 2020, over 750,000 cases have been confirmed
      worldwide leading to over 34,000 deaths (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). There is no
      current vaccine available, but there have been a number of reports of medication such as
      hydroxychloroquine having antiviral properties with efficacy against SARS-CoV-2.

      Plasma therapy using convalescent plasma has been shown to be effective in severe acute
      respiratory syndrome, Ebola virus infection and in H1N1 influenza. More recently there has
      been a report of the use of convalescent plasma in the treatment of 5 ventilated COVID-19
      patients with the suggestion of expedited recovery as the patients improved 1 week after the
      transfusion. However, this was not a clinical trial and the patients were on other antiviral
      medication; therefore, there is a need to undertake such a trial to see if deploying plasma
      with SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody has utility in managing patients infected with COVID-19
      in respiratory distress.

      The objective of this pilot study is to compare plasma therapy using convalescent plasma with
      antibody against SARS-CoV-2 to usual supportive therapy in COVID-19 patients with pneumonia
      and hypoxia, and to determine if the clinical course is improved. The difference between
      groups will allow an effect size to be determined for a definitive clinical trial

      Could using convalescent plasma transfusion, from recovered COVID19 patients with antibody
      against COVID-19 be beneficial in treatment of COVID19 patients with hypoxia and pneumonia,
      in order to avoid or delay the need for invasive ventilation?

      This is a prospective, interventional and randomized open label trial involving 40 patients
      with COVID-19 who are in respiratory distress, with the criteria that all require oxygen
      therapy and have radiological evidence of pneumonia, 20 of whom will receive a single
      transfusion of convalescent patient plasma plus routine care, compared to 20 COVID-19
      patients who will receive routine care alone.
