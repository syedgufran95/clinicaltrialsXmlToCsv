  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Convalescent plasma has been shown to be safe and effective for treatment of several
      diseases. Preliminary data indicates that it is safe and effective for treatment of COVID.
      However, data is limited to small studies and case series on severely ill patients.

      In a preliminary safety study 10 patients with severe COVID-19, defined as requiring
      supplementary oxygen, having fever and a duration of illness less than 11 days were treated
      with 200 ml of CP. CP was given as a slow infusion without obvious adverse events. Eight
      patients had viremia. One patient rapidly cleared the virus and recovered following CP
      treatment. CP infusion did not appear to clear viremia in 7/8 patients. Five of these were
      eventually admitted to ICU. Thus CP did not appear to cause acute toxicity but did not seem
      to be effective at the dose used. Viremia seemed to be a marker of a high risk of disease
      progression The proposed study thus aims to treat a high risk population identified by having
      viremia irrespective of but hopefully before they develop pulmonary injury such that they
      require supplementary oxygen therapy. Moreover the dose of plasma will be increased
      incrementally with the aim of clearing viremia as our initial study indicates that continued
      viremia is driving COVID-19.
