  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Understanding the SARS-Cov2 epidemic is a major public health issue, both in the community
      and in the hospital sector. Because of their central position in the management of patients
      infected with COVID-19, hospital staff may be considered at high risk of infection. The
      development of serological tests makes it possible to reliably document a contamination,
      symptomatic or not, that is more than 3 weeks old. These tests, combined with clinical
      questioning of the symptoms, make it possible to determine the proportion of asymptomatic
      infections whose impact in the transmission of this disease appears to be major. The duration
      of the presence of the antibodies that are hoped to neutralize after infection with CoV2-SARS
      remains uncertain. Documenting the evolution of antibody levels and their monitoring in a
      population at high risk of re-exposure to CoV2-SARS is a major issue in understanding this
      disease and in assessing the risk of infection among healthcare workers.

      This is a multi-center, prospective, interventional, low-risk, low-constraint, biological
      collection study to assess the exposure of health care workers to COVID-19.

      Three blood samples will be taken at day 1, month 3 and month 6. The blood samples will be
      stored in a serum biological collection. A prospective data collection will be set up at the
      level of symptoms and co-morbidities at each collection at D1, M3 and M6.

      In the event of the appearance of symptoms between samples, a self-questionnaire will be
      completed by the participating personnel as well as an invitation to screening by RT-PCR SARS
      Cov2 according to standard practices in force at the national level as well as an additional
      serological test.
