  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of a one-session, hour-long
      HIPAA-compliant video platform-based mindfulness + compassion telehealth intervention on
      reducing feelings of loneliness during COVID-19 quarantine. Participants (n=120) currently
      isolating due to COVID-19 will be randomized to one of three interventions: (a) mindfulness +
      compassion (MC); (b) mindfulness alone (MO); and (c) waitlist control (WL).

      The investigators predict that participants in the active intervention groups (mindfulness or
      mindfulness + compassion) will show a significantly greater reduction in subjective feelings
      of loneliness at one week follow-up compared to those in the waitlist control group.
      Additionally, investigators predict that participants in the active intervention groups will
      show a significantly greater reduction in stress at one week follow-up compared to those in
      the waitlist control group. Last, investigators predict that participants in the mindfulness
      + compassion group will show a significantly greater reduction in subjective feelings of
      loneliness at the 2-week follow-up follow-up relative to those in the mindfulness only group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals are currently living in an unprecedented time where they are isolated in their
      homes for an extended period due to the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
      Feelings of loneliness, or perceived social isolation, have often been cited as accompanying
      objective social isolation. Prior research has established a link between loneliness and a
      variety of mental health outcomes including increased depressive symptoms, increased stress
      reactivity, and increased risk of suicidal thoughts and attempts.

      The urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic thus necessitates the investigation of potential
      short-term interventions for loneliness. Research has suggested that longer-term mindfulness
      interventions may be effective in mitigating feelings of loneliness and its concomitant
      mental health outcomes. The proposed study seeks to determine the preliminary efficacy of a
      one-session mindfulness-based telehealth intervention for loneliness during COVID-19. To
      increase the potency of this mindfulness-based intervention, the investigators aim to
      incorporate compassion motivated social engagement.

      There is ample evidence that mindfulness alone is an effective intervention method for
      addressing loneliness. However, inclusion of a compassion component may amplify the effects
      of an intervention on loneliness because prior research has found that less compassion is
      associated with greater loneliness. To date, no research has explicitly tested the effect of
      incorporating compassion into a mindfulness intervention for reducing feelings of loneliness.
