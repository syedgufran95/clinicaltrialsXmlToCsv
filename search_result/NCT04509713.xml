  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dogs are some of nature's greatest detectives, owing to their incredible sense of smell and
      ability to be trained. Most of us will be familiar with seeing trained sniffer dogs at
      airports looking for drugs and other prohibited items, but their skills don't stop there. The
      use of medical detection dogs is becoming increasingly common, as they are able to identify
      cancers, changes in blood sugar levels and even predict seizures. These are just a few
      examples of dogs playing a key role in public health. Many diseases can alter the way humans
      smell. A study undertaken by the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and
      Durham University has shown that dogs are able to accurately diagnose malaria. The
      investigators know that respiratory illnesses can alter your body odours, and thus the
      investigators plan to determine whether dogs are able to identify the novel coronavirus known
      as COVID-19 (or SARS-CoV-2).

      COVID-19 can present itself asymptomatically (i.e. causing no apparent symptoms), which could
      lead to the spread of infection in the population. The investigators believe that dogs may be
      able to identify asymptomatic patients, as well as those who have mild symptoms (symptoms not
      requiring treatment, hospital stay or limiting normal activities). It is thought that a
      single medical detection dog stationed within an airport would be able to screen up to 750
      people for COVID-19 infection in just 1 hour, informing those who are infected to isolate,
      preventing further spread of the disease.

      In order to determine whether it is possible for dogs to accurately diagnose COVID-19, the
      investigators must first collect samples. NHS staff and members of their households that are
      eligible for SARS-CoV-2 screening, have been selected to participate in this study due to
      their potential exposure to this disease agent. In addition, participants from the general
      population who are displaying mild COVID-19 symptoms or have been exposed to COVID-19 will be
      recruited via hospitals, testing centers, outbreak testing programs and home testing
      programs. Initially, participants will attend their screening test as planned or confirm that
      they have had a swab test within the previous 24 hours. Immediately following this, the
      investigators will ask participants to collect samples of breath odour and body odour, which
      will be collected passively through the wearing of face masks, shirts, and nylon socks. The
      investigators will ask to be provided with the results of the SARS-CoV-2 screening swab,
      which will allow for us to determine whether participants are positive or negative for
      SARS-CoV-2. These odour samples will be grouped by positive or negative test results, and
      transported to LSHTM where these will be processed in order to prevent contact with the
      virus, negating the risk for dogs and their handlers.

      A pilot study will be undertaken to confirm whether dogs are able to distinguish between
      positive and negative samples using traditional sniffer dog training methods. If this is
      possible, the investigators will proceed to the main study to determine the accuracy (known
      as sensitivity and specificity) of the dogs' ability to identify the virus. Both the handler
      and the dogs themselves will be 'blinded' to the samples, and thus unaware of which sample is
      which. When the data generated by these tests is entered, it will be confirmed whether or not
      the samples have been correctly identified.

      The dogs will be trained to detect and report the detection of the volatile odours
      characteristic of COVID-19 infection. For quality control purposes the investigators also aim
      to characterise the COVID-19 odour profile by analysing samples with a special process called
      GC (gas chromatography) and/or GC-MS (gas chromatography coupled mass spectrometry). This
      will help to inform the identification of compounds showing differences between infected and
      non-infected samples.

      The investigators believe that this work could be useful in the fight against COVID-19.

    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The main study is designed to measure the sensitivity and specificity of the dogs to detect participants infected with SARS-CoV-2. Dogs will be trained for a period of 6-8 weeks to give a behavior response to positive samples. During training the reaction of each dog to a positive sample will be observed (i.e. standing, sitting or lying down) and this indicating behaviour reinforced by rewarding the dog. The dog's diagnostic accuracy will then be determined in a double-blinded study. Here the trainer and technician using the computer to record the results of the study are blinded to the identity of each sample until the trainer calls the final decision (positive or negative) based on the response of the dog to the sample.</description>
