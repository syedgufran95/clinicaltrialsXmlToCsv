      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the performance of Breath Biopsy RD for the
      detection of SARS-CoV-2 in both a clinical and at home setting.

      This study aims to evaluate Owlstone Medical's Breath Biopsy RD Collectors for the detection
      of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These single use disposable breath capture devices can be used
      independently by individuals and shipped to be analysed in a central lab for the presence of
      SARS-CoV-2 using established existing PCR assays available in any reference lab. The aerosol
      collectors furthermore directly sample exhaled breath aerosols. As such they directly sample
      the primary transmission route for the virus. This could result in a higher rate of retrieval
      of viral RNA in infected individuals thereby increasing the sensitivity of the applied PCR
      assay. This is underpinned by the fact that CT abnormalities in the lower airways appear to
      occur prior to upper respiratory tract samples becoming positive in cases suffering from
      nCOVID19, suggesting lower airway viral loads could be higher. Combined, this could enable
      more widespread access to diagnostics, reduce the need for repeat testing, decrease the need
      for healthcare professionals to perform diagnostic tests and reduce cross-contamination risk.

    <description>The purpose of this stage is to confirm the optimal extraction protocol to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 from the aerosols captured in the Breath Biopsy RD device. Up to two Breath Biopsy RD sample will be collected alongside a nasopharyngeal. The swab obtained during this stage is to be analysed in parallel to the extracted breath aerosols in the lab of the lab and will be used as a positive control.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of test performance</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The aim is to assess the test performance of the Breath Biopsy RD devices in a real live clinical setting. Subjects with a high clinical suspicion of nCOVID-19 based on clinical triage will be requested to participate. A single Breath Biopsy RD collector will be collected in parallel with the standard diagnostic work-up consisting of a CT-scan and a nasopharyngeal swab.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of at home test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The aim of the final outcome is to evaluate the performance and acceptability of using the Breath Biopsy RD as an at home test for identification of the presence of SARS-CoV-2. The OLVG phone application used for triage of the presence of nCOVID-19 will be used to identify subjects at the highest risk of having nCOVID-19. These subjects will be sent a Breath Biopsy RD collector and oropharyngeal swab for at home testing. Any subject who has a positive Breath Biopsy test for SARS-CoV-2 will be contacted and advised to receive a nasopharyngeal test for assessment of viral presence. Both tests will be self-administered to mimic an at home use scenario. The performance of both tests will be confirmed from the perspective of 1. Adherence 2. Subject comfort 3. Number of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases.</description>

      The face mask will be placed onto the subject's face, covering his/her nose and mouth, head
      straps will be used to ensure that the face mask is kept in place for the duration of the
      test. This mask will contain a material designed to capture exhaled respiratory droplets
      and/or aerosols. Several iterations of these impaction and filtration devices may be used to
      optimize functional attributes of the material for capture of COVID. These materials will
      always have a proven safety for use with humans.

      Subjects can talk, cough and sneeze in the mask or can temporarily remove the mask if
      uncomfortable, to drink some water etc if required. Total collection time spread across two
      masks will not exceed one hour
