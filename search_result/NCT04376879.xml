  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the main challenges of the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 epidemic is the
      availability of beds in intensive care units (ICUs) and, more importantly, the need for
      invasive mechanical ventilation (IVM) because the ICUs are currently reserved for intubated
      patients.

      The experiences of both China and Italy indicate that a certain number of COVID-19 patients
      will require mechanical ventilation. However, the limited number of resuscitation beds and
      ventilators requires strict use of these scarce resources. As a significant proportion about
      5% to 10%, of patients initially admitted to hospital with COVID-19 will require ventilation,
      it is essential to anticipate their need for resuscitation to improve the rare resource of
      beds and ventilator shortages in intensive care units.

      The hypothesis of the study is that, in proven or suspected hospitalised and oxygen-requiring
      COVID-19 patients, an early predictive clinical score, calculated over the three first days
      of admission may allow for an earlier identification of patients who will require intubation
      and transfer to an intensive care unit for orotracheal intubation
