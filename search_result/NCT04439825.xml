      Botox treatment into the upper one third of the face (glabella, forehead lines and/or lateral
      canthal lines) to analyze mood and self -appearance satisfaction in a Post Covid period on
      non-na誰ve Botox patients

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A historical period that will never happen again provides us a unique opportunity to evaluate
      the impact Botox Cosmetic has on the mood and self appearance satisfaction after a societal
      crisis such as the COVID19 pandemic.

      Many regular users of Botox Cosmetic will have exceeded their normal treatment interval and
      their glabellar wrinkles will likely have returned to baseline. Many will want to get treated
      as soon as stay at home orders are rescinded and clinics are permitted to open back up. It
      would not be surprising that these patients also are experiencing a decrease in their mood
      secondary to weeks of social isolating and distancing. Many can expect to have a rebound
      elevation in their happiness and overall mood following the modified return to normalcy.

      Botox Cosmetic has been studied as a mood elevating drug by reducing the animation of a
      glabellar furrow via the facial feedback mechanism hypothesis. This has been shown in
      patients who are not diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. Following a natural
      disaster, does the administration of Botox Cosmetic, in patients who are frequent Botox
      Cosmetic users, synergistically amplify the elevation in mood beyond what would be achieved
      had they not had their Botox Cosmetic treatment. Perhaps regular Botox Cosmetic users have a
      secondary gain desire for Botox Cosmetic beyond wrinkle reduction but also as a mood
      elevator.
