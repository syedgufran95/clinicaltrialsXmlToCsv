                  confirmed by repeat measurement

               -  QRS duration &gt;110 ms confirmed by repeat measurement

               -  PR interval &gt;220 ms confirmed by repeat measurements

               -  findings which would make QTc measurements difficult or QTc data uninterpretable

                  hypokalemia, family history of long QT syndrome).

          -  Except as noted, has used prescription drugs (other than hormone replacement therapy)
             within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug unless, in the opinion of the PI
             (or designee), the drug will not interfere with study assessments.

          -  Has received an experimental agent (vaccine, drug, biologic, device, blood product or
