      Plasma exchanges with 5% human albumin (2/3 of the exchanged plasma volume) and fresh frozen
      plasma (FFP: 1/3) in patients with quick &lt;50% or only with 5% albumin in patients with quick
      of 50% or more. We will exchange between 1.2 and 1.5 plasma volumes, that will vary according
      to sex, weight, height and hematocrit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plasma exchange (PE) is a standardized and safe therapeutic procedure, used in the treatment
      of various diseases that require rapid and prolonged elimination of endogenous and exogenous
      substances, with deleterious effects on the function of different organs and systems. The
      efficacy and safety of PE has been demonstrated in patients with fulminant hepatitis (FH), an
      entity characterized by an exacerbated inflammatory response, multi-organ failure, and high
      short-term mortality. In FH, plasma exchange improves systemic inflammation, prevents organ
      failure and renal support requirements, and improves survival. Such treatment eliminates
      important endogenous and exogenous inducers of the systemic inflammatory response (PAMPs and
      DAMPs), proinflammatory mediators (cytokines and ROS), and other biologically active
      substances (nitric oxide, prostaglandins, and bradykinin) that are involved in the
      pathogenesis of organ failure. Several case reports also suggest that PE is an effective
      rescue therapy in critically ill patients with influenza A (H1N1). However, the efficacy of
      PE has not been evaluated in critically ill patients with COVID-19 disease.
