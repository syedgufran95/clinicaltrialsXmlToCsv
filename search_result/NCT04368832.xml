  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a non-randomized, quasi-experimental, monocentric study comparing two prenatal
      monitoring modes in low-risk pregnancy: including at least one remote consultation (phone or
      teleconsultation) versus face-to-face adapted to confinement. The quality of care perceived
      by the pregnant women were evaluated according to monitoring modes set up during the COVID-19
      pandemic confinement period. The women included planned to give birth at the regional
      academic Maternity of Nancy, France.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The emergency confinement measures deployed by most industrialized countries governments to
      limit the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) pandemic resulted in rapid and
      unpredictable changes in methods of obstetric monitoring. International and French government
      recommendations called for a reorganization of mandatory monitoring, particularly for
      low-risk pregnancies (limit the presence of the coparent during follow-up consultations and
      implement remote consultations). The potential impact of this reorganization on care
      perception, probably increased by the context of an unprecedented economic, social and health
      crisis, is unpredictable. In the absence of a previous event of comparable importance, it is
      impossible to anticipate differences in satisfaction with antenatal management and in stress
      level between women exposed to the two types of monitoring. Many factors can influence the
      perception of care quality, such as the socio-economic environment and the level of health
      literacy, that is, the individual's ability to find information on health, to understand and
      use this information to improve his own health or develop autonomy in health care system.

      The objective of this study is to determine which type of monitoring is better perceived by
      pregnant women, the factors associated with this perception and the links with the level of
      knowledge and mastery of women regarding reproductive health and digital tools.
