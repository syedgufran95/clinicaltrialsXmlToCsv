  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate patient and consultant experiences with phone
      consultations for endoscopy-related outpatient appointments during the COVID-19 outbreak.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Telephone consultations as a method for telehealth do not provide visual cues and limit
      interpretation of visual signs such as visualization of skin lesions. However, the need of
      such feedback is almost non-existent for endoscopy-related consultations as their purpose is
      focused. The main foci of endoscopy-related outpatient clinics are two: 1 - inform and
      consent the patient for an endoscopic procedure that is to be done in the near future; 2 -
      explain the results of a recent procedure already performed and which has a copy provided to
      the patient. Therefore, phone consultations might be a good fit for endoscopy-related
      outpatient clinics. The practicalities and indications for the use of phone consults has been
      described by van Galen &amp; Car (2018) and fit the above description.

      Patients will be invited to participate only after the consultation have been finalised and
      all questions regarding the endoscopic procedure to be done/that was done have been
      clarified. Patients and consultants will fill questionnaires to evaluate the phone
      consultation.

      The primary outcome will the the comparison of &quot;failed to attend&quot; (FTA) occurrences compared
      to a similar period of the past year. Secondary outcomes will be patients' and consultants'
      satisfaction with the phone consultation.
