  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While &quot;conditioning&quot; by exercise training has been widely evaluated, the available literature
      on &quot;passive deconditioning&quot; (i.e. forced deconditioning) is predominately limited to studies
      with or with almost complete mechanical and/or metabolic immobilization/sedation of the
      respective functional system (e.g. paralysis, bedriddenness). Vice versa, the effects of
      moderately long interruptions of dedicated types of exercise while maintaining everyday
      activity are rarely addressed. However, this topic is of high relevance, e.g. considering
      that breaks of health-related exercise programs due to increased family/occupational stress,
      vacation or temporary orthopedic limitation are rather frequent in everyday life. In the
      present project we aimed to determine the effects of 3 months of physical deconditioning due
      to COVID-19 induced lockdown after 13 month of high intensity endurance and resistance
      exercise in early postmenopausal women on parameters related to health and physical fitness.
