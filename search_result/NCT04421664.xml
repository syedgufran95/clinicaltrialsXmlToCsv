      Study Objective:

      To test if early preemptive hydroxychloroquine therapy can prevent disease progression in
      persons with known symptomatic COVID-19 disease, decreasing hospitalizations and symptom
      severity.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a rapidly emerging viral
      infection causing COVID19. Therapy is generally not given to persons who are not
      hospitalized.

      Hydroxychloroquine may have antiviral effects against SARS-CoV2 which may decrease disease
      severity when given early. This trial will use a modification of standard malaria dosing of
      hydroxychloroquine to provide preemptive therapy for those with early symptoms.

      This study is a continuation of NCT04308668 which looked at post-exposure prophylaxis (now
      closed) and early treatment in the USA (now closed, data to be pooled) and Canada (which
      continues in this study). On April 28, 2020 NCT04308668 changed its primary outcome to
      symptomatic improvement in the preemptive therapy arm. This study continues enrollment for
      the primary ordinal outcome of hospitalization; hospitalization with intensive care stay; or
      death.

      People in the participating Canadian provinces can help answer this critically important
      question. No in-person visits are needed.

      The doses of hydroxychloroquine being used have been approved by Health Canada.

      This trial is targeting the following groups of people:

      If you are symptomatic with a positive COVID-19 test within the first 4 days of symptoms and
      are not hospitalized; OR If you have had occupational exposure with known exposure to someone
      with lab-confirmed COVID-19 within the last 14 days AND have compatible symptoms starting
      within the last 4 days;

      You may participate if you live anywhere in the Canadian Provinces of Quebec, Manitoba,
      Alberta, British Columbia, Newfoundland or Ontario.

    <description>Participants will self-report disease severity status as one of the following 3 options; no COVID19 illness (score of 1), COVID19 illness with no hospitalization (score of 2), or COVID19 illness with hospitalization or death (score of 3).
