  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates TL-895, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). This is a 2-part study
      comprising a Phase 1 safety lead-in (Part 1) that will determine the recommended TL-895 dose
      for Phase 2 (Part 2).

      In Part 1, TL-895 open-label will be administered orally at an assigned dose continuously in
      7-day cycles for 2 cycles. Up to 3 dose levels will be evaluated.

      In Part 2, eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to TL-895 with standard
      available treatment (SAT), or placebo with SAT. Investigators and Sponsor will be blinded to
      each subject's assigned study intervention throughout the course of the study.

    <masking_description>The control product in this study is placebo. The placebo will only be used in Part 2. Placebo will be matched in appearance and packaging to active investigational product TL-895.
Investigators and Sponsor will be blinded to each subject's assigned study treatment in Part 2 (the double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of the study) via unique kit numbers on study drug cartons.</masking_description>
