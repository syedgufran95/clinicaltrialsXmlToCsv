      Study Objectives:

      Primary

        -  To assess the efficacy (survival without organ failure on Day 14) of three doses of
           rhu-pGSN administered intravenously (IV) plus standard of care (SOC) to hospitalized
           subjects with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and a severity score of 4, 5 or
           6 on the World Health Organization (WHO) 9-point severity scale

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of three IV doses of rhu-pGSN administered to
           hospitalized subjects with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and a severity
           score of 4, 5, or 6 on the WHO 9-point severity scale

      Secondary

        -  To further assess the efficacy of IV administered rhu-pGSN

        -  To assess changes in WHO 9-point severity score for SOC with or without rhu-pGSN

        -  To evaluate the effect of administered rhu-pGSN on survival rates

        -  To assess the relationship of pGSN levels (and other biomarkers) at baseline with
           clinical outcomes

        -  [OPTIONAL] To follow the pharmacokinetics (PK) of administered rhu-pGSN

      Immunogenicity

      • To investigate the development of antibodies against rhu-pGSN post-treatment

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Efficacy and safety of IV rhu-pGSN on top of SOC will be evaluated initially in 60
      participants representative of the drug target population: high-risk subjects with acute
      severe pneumonia due to COVID-19. The rhu-pGSN dose will be based on actual body weight given
      at 12 mg/kg. Three doses will be given at 0, 12 and 24 hours intervals promptly after
      enrollment by IV infusion through a 0.2 µm filter. Participants will be randomized 1:1
      rhu-pGSN or placebo. Interim safety analyses will be conducted after enrollment of 12, 24,
      36, and 48 patients.

      The primary efficacy outcome will be the proportion of patients surviving on Day 14 without
      mechanical ventilation, vasopressors or dialysis. Secondary efficacy outcomes will include:
      daily change in 9-point WHO severity score through at least Day 14; all-cause mortality at
      Days 28 and 90; time to death (Kaplan-Meier survival analysis); proportion of subjects alive
      on Days 7, 28, 60, and 90 without: ongoing use of vasopressors, ongoing intubation/mechanical
      ventilation, ongoing residence in an intensive care unit (ICU), new ongoing need for
      dialysis/renal replacement therapy; proportion of subjects discharged to home or immediate
      prior residence by Day 28; days on the ventilator; length of stay in hospital and in ICU and
      re-admission to an acute-care hospital up to Day 90. Safety of administration of rhu-pGSN at
      the indicated dosage will also be evaluated.

      Baseline and sequential levels of pGSN and inflammatory biomarkers will be measured. On days
      1, 28, and 90, immunogenicity due to the formation of anti-pGSN antibodies will be assessed.
