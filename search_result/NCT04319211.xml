    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to investigate the physical activity, quality of life and stress
      levels of individuals living in their homes isolated due to coronavirus (COVID-19) disease.
      The last three sections of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) will be
      used to evaluate the current physical activity level of the participants. Parameters such as
      housework, home care and family care, rest, sports and leisure physical activities, sitting
      time will be evaluated. Short Form 12 (Short Form12- SF12) quality of life scale will be used
      to evaluate health-related quality of life. Beck Depression Scale will be applied to
      investigate the stress levels of the individuals participating in our study.

    <textblock>
      Coronaviruses (CoV) make up a large family of viruses found in nature. The first CoV of this
      decade called 2019-nCoV originated in Wuhan, China. On January 30, 2020, the &quot;International
      Public Health Emergency&quot; was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). As of February
      11, 2020, the data of the World Health Organization (WHO) reported more than 43,000 confirmed
      cases in 28 countries. As of March 19, 2020, 2019-nCoV reported more than 150 countries,
      209,839 cases and 8,778 cases resulted in death. Since efforts to design and develop an
      antiviral agent will take time to combat the currently occurring coronavirus pathogen, great
      emphasis is placed on implementing control measures to minimize the risk of 2019-nCoV
      transmission and spread. Countries have implemented serious interventions to prevent the
      spread of the disease. Some of those; holiday of schools, cancellation of all crowded
      meetings, the cancellation of social events and organizations, encouraging citizens to work
      and stay at home and provide social isolation. Turkey is also taken similar measures to
      control the outbreak. In this process, people isolate themselves in their homes and live a
      quiet life away from the social environment. Being away from the social environment and
      loneliness are among the factors that contribute negatively to the mental health of
      individuals. It is also an issue associated with quality of life and depressive symptoms. It
      is uncertain how and how much an individual's isolated life at home affects the level of
      physical activity. The aim of our study is to investigate the physical activity, quality of
      life and stress levels of individuals living in their homes isolated due to coronavirus
      (COVID-19) disease.
