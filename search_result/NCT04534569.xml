      The investigators aim to achieve experts consensus on respiratory interventions in management
      of COVID-19 related acute respiratory failure (C-ARF). The pandemic of COVID-19 is unique in
      terms of a multitude of patients suffering from ARF and requiring invasive mechanical
      ventilation with single underlying inciting etiology.The experts have given divergent
      opinions on respiratory support of C-ARF which may have confused physicians globally.

      The investigators are going to use a modified Delphi based methodology involving global
      participating experts. The objective is to achieve consensus statement on the management of
      C-ARF using &quot;collective intelligence&quot;.

      The whole process of this study will be done in the form of two-three rounds of Google
      Forms-based Delphi surveys. In this survey questionnaire, the investigators have prepared
      statements on the concern areas in the respiratory support of C-ARF. The survey has been
      divided into five sections related to C-ARF management. The majority of these statements are
      to be rated on Likert scale and others have multiple choices. There is an option for
      collecting participating experts comments in provided open space in round one which will be
      considered during round two questionnaire.
