      The purpose of this study is to provide weekly data on the proportion of seroconverted
      children and their immune status. It will also provide insight into the number of children
      currently infected at each time point including healthy carriers. Investigators will provide
      similar data on their parents in an ancillary study.

    <textblock>
      The fraction of undiagnosed but likely to transmit the virus is a critical epidemiological
      characteristic that modulates the epidemic potential of SARS-CoV2. To adapt the epidemy
      control, it is essential to study the immunoprotection of the general population. A crucial
      question is the study of pauci or asymptomatic subjects, and in particular children who make
      mild forms, because they could act as a real reservoir for the spread of the virus. The
      serological study is essential in this context.

      The objective of the study is to assess immunoprevalence thanks to the combination of a rapid
      test (NGBiotech / CEA) and a classic test (Institut Pasteur) as well as immunoprotection
      (neutralizing Ab, Institut Pasteur) in a sample of 960 children hospitalized for less than 4
      days in 8 pediatric sites of the APHP and 1 of their parent during the next 2 months. This
      study will also assess the relevance of studying other sampling sites than the nasopharynx,
      for the diagnosis of infection, such as saliva, a very informative biofluid in other viral
      infections such as measles and much easier to collect. This study will be complemented by a
      longitudinal study on a subpopulation of 30 children positive in PCR, whatever the site,
      aiming to evaluate the kinetics of seroconversion and the time of viral carriage and
      acquisition of immune memory, to better characterize the natural history of l infection in
      asymptomatic subjects (D7, D15, D30). An ancillary study will include 1 parent of each child
      for serology with, if he has presented signs compatible with a COVID-19 infection,
      nasopharyngeal sample and saliva. If the parent has PCR + samples, he will also be followed
      in a longitudinal study similar to that of their child.

      This study will make it possible to better describe, in healthy carriers or pauci symptomatic
      children and their parents, the prevalence of infected patients (viral reservoir), and their
      immune response, which are decisive data in the definition of measures to control the
      epidemic, the decision to lift containment and reopen schools The results will be given in
      real time weekly to the health authorities for an expected duration of 2 months and will make
      it possible to assess the weekly evolution of the epidemic on 120 to 150 children included
      each week and their parents, ie 250 to 300 subjects and 2000 subjects in total. The study
      sites cover the Paris metropolitan area and its suburbs, and in particular the Seine Saint
      Denis, a department which has been heavily impacted, in order to provide an accurate map of
      population immunoprotection and the circulation of the virus.
