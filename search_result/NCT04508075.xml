      This phase III trial aims to assess the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2
      Vaccine (inactivated) and lot-to-lot consistency evaluation

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is Randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled two arms parallel group,
      prospective intervention study

      Approximately 1620 subjects aged 18-59 years will be enrolled in this trial for efficacy
      evaluation. Subjects will be divided into 2 treatment arms that are the vaccinated group and
      placebo group with ratio 1:1. The vaccinated arms will be grouped into three different lot
      number (lot 1/lot 2/ lot 3) of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.
