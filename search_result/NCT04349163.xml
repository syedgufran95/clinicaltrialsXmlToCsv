  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The outbreak linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection was declared a Public Health Emergency of
      International Concern on 30 January 2020. In all of the emergency Departments, a major
      reorganization was necessary, notably with the creation of a specific channel for COVID-19
      suspect patients. Thus, all caregivers involved must adapt day by day to new places of
      exercise, new protocols,...The major influx of patients, the precautions to be taken, the
      specifics of the pathology and its management have profoundly changed daily practice. This
      exogenous hospital tension impacts all caregivers and more particularly their resilience
      capacities. Resilience is defined as an ability to recover from or adjust easily to
      misfortune or change. The Resi-CoV study aims to assess the level of resilience of caregivers
      of different specialties and trades in the context of covid-19.

      Caregivers will be invited to complete a self-administered questionnaire online via a
      personalized electronic message. Caregivers will be free to participate. Signed consent will
      not be requested, but the return of the questionnaire will be considered consent. The
      questionnaire will be administered using Google formÂ® software. Caregivers will have 2 weeks
      to respond. A reminder will be made at 7 days. The questionnaire will be anonymized upon
      receipt by the investigator.
