    <textblock>
      Problems such as breathlessness, exercise intolerance and loss of peripheral muscle strength
      can be observed in individuals who have been diagnosed with COVID19 and have been discharged.
      In our study, it was aimed to investigate the effect of telerehabilitation physical therapy
      intervention to these cases by using videoconferencing method on the physical condition of
      the cases.

      Problems such as breathlessness, exercise intolerance and loss of peripheral muscle strength
      can be observed in individuals who have been diagnosed with COVID19 and have been discharged.
      In our study, it was aimed to investigate the effect of telerehabilitation physical therapy
      intervention to these cases by using videoconferencing method on the physical condition of
      the cases. The exercise program will be a total of 6 weeks, 3 days a week. Online access will
      be carried out synchronously by telephone or computer, and training sessions will not be
      recorded in order to protect patient personal information. The cases will be evaluated online
      at the beginning of the study and at the end of the 6-week exercise program. The selected
      evaluation parameters have been selected considering the ease of online application.

    <measure>Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The mMRC Dyspnea Scale is best used to establish baseline functional impairment due to dyspnea attributable to respiratory disease; tracking the mMRC over time or with therapeutic interventions is of less certain clinical utility.The severity of dyspnea is rated on a scale of 0 to 4. &quot;O&quot; means no dyspnea perception, &quot;4&quot; means severe dyspnea perception.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed up and go test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed &quot;Up and Go&quot; (TUG) Test measures, in seconds, the time taken by an individual to stand up from a standard arm chair (approximate seat height of 46 cm, arm height 65 cm), walk a distance of 3 meters (approximately 10 feet), turn, walk back to the chair, and sit down.
Normal healthy elderly usually complete the task in 10 seconds or less. Very frail or weak elderly with poor mobility may take 2 minutes or more.
Clinical guide: &lt;10 seconds = normal &lt;20 seconds = good mobility, can go out alone, mobile without a gait aid &lt;30 seconds = problems, cannot go outside alone, requires a gait aid A score of more than or equal to 14 seconds has been shown to indicate high risk of falls.</description>

    <measure>Visual analog scale to assess the pain severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analog scale to assess the pain on a horizontal, non-calibrated line of 100 mm, ranging from very low (0) to very high (100) score.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) is comprised of 3 tasks: a standing balance test (side by side, semi-tandem and tandem), a 4-m habitual gait speed, and 5 sit to stand from a chair. Each task is scored (based on time) from 0-4 points. The total score is 12 points and this represents the highest performance. It can be easily performed at home via video conferencing</description>
