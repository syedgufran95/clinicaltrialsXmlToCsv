  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Covid-19 is associated with a wide range of symptoms and clinical trajectories, and early
      identification of patients at risk for developing severe disease is desirable. Several risk
      markers and comorbidity profiles have been proposed but their relative importance in
      unselected patients admitted to hospital with Covid-19 remains unclear. This study aims to
      assess the prognostic value organ specific biomarkers, viral dynamics and immune response
      markers in patients infected with SARS-CoV2.
