  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Context:

      Based on currently available data, most of national health authorities and consensus expert
      groups have written guidelines for the management of cancer patients in the context of COVID.
      However, the preparation of these guidelines was limited by the scarcity of solid
      epidemiological data. For example, the experts were uncomfortable to formulate precise
      guidelines on which anti-cancer treatment should be interrupted or replaced, on which
      patients, and how to adapt supportive drug prescriptions.

      Objectives :

        -  To measure the excess risk of mortality and morbidity of patients with a history of
           cancer among patients hospitalized for a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

        -  To identify factors associated with the risk of death and morbidity among patients with
           cancer.

      Methodology:

      Retrospective inclusion of n=200 cancer patients hospitalized for COVID and n=400 matched
      (based on age, gender, and comorbidity) non-cancer patients hospitalized for COVID. Two
      analyses will be performed (after the inclusion of n=100 and n=200 patients with cancer). A
      logistic modeling of the odds ratio of death associated to the exposition factor (i.e.
      cancer) and adjusted for the matching parameters (age, gender, comorbidities) will be
      proposed.

      We will then look for the factors (related to the patients, the cancer or the treatment) that
      modify the odds radio.

      Expected results:

      The data generated will help the medical and scientific community to evaluate the increasing
      risk of cancer patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 compared to the non-cancer population, to
      identify patients at higher risk of severe infection, but also the anticancer treatments
      associated with an increased risk of severe infections.

      Impact:

      These data will contribute to guide the future recommendations concerning cancer patient's
      care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a real risk that the SARS-CoV
      epidemic, or other respiratory viruses epidemic, will become recurrent in the future. Thus,
      it is of crucial importance for now and for the future to know which are the major factors
      associated with severe infections

        Two categories of patients will be defined: the &quot;exposed patients&quot; are patients with cancer
        that are hospitalized in one of the participating centers for a SARS-CoV-2 infection. A
        patient will be considered as an &quot;exposed patient&quot; if he/she had a surgical procedure or a
        medical treatment for cancer in the past 5 years preceding the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

        The &quot;control patients&quot; are all of the patients without cancer that are hospitalized in one
        of the participating centers for a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

        In both cohorts, a positive laboratory test (RT-PCR) proving the SARS-CoV-2 infection will
        be mandatory.
