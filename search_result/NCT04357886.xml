      The following hypotheses were established in this study:

      H0: There is no difference in terms of COVID-19 in different age groups in Turkey.

      H1: There is a difference in terms of COVID-19 in different age groups in Turkey.

      It is known that social awareness is low because COVID-19 is a new virus. There are
      protective measures created based on scientific studies conducted during the epidemic, but
      there is no certainty about how much these measures are known to our society.

      Based on these aim of our study is that individuals in different age groups throughout Turkey
      to investigate and compare the new coronavirus awareness

      Statistical Methods: Statistical Package for Social Sciences/SPSS 21.0 (SPSS) in the
      statistical analysis of the data obtained statistics program will be used. In the study,
      arithmetic averages will be presented with mean Â± standard deviation and values indicated by
      counting are presented in tables and graphs in the form of numbers (percent). In the study,
      the relationship between the variables will be tested with the Spearman correlation
      coefficient. In all analyzes, p &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.

      Sampling: The sample size was calculated based on the number of questions asked.

      Accordingly, the number of questions times the lower limit is determined according to the
      formula 20 (42*20=840). Considering the missing data and the possibility of falling, it was
      concluded that 1000 people should be recruited. Consent will be obtained from the
      participants through a voluntary information form.
