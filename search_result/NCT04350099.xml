  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 ( known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)) has a
      highly polymorphic clinical presentation, ranging from pauci-symptomatic infection to severe,
      potentially complicated forms with acute respiratory distress syndrome or multisystemic
      organs failure. The picture may be initially severe, or it may progress in two stages, with
      worsening 7 to 10 days after the first symptoms with an overall case-fatality rate of 3 to
      4%.

      Its management is essentially symptomatic, as no antiviral treatment has so far demonstrated
      a clinical benefit in this condition.

      In such a context, healthcare professionals assigned to COVID units will be faced with a
      heavy workload and emotional burden that could lead to psychological suffering or even
      burnout and its consequences.

      We would therefore like to describe, using validated tools, the emotional evolution of the
      care workers at the Limoges University Hospital and the Esquirol University Hospital faced
      with this new pandemic infection. An initial and end-of-study evaluation of the caregivers
      will be carried out concerning their anxiety and depressive state, their personal capacity
      for resilience and their degree of empathy
