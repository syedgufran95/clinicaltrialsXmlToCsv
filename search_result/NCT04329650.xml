  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In our center up to 25% of the hospitalized patients with COVID-19 progress and need an
      intensive care unit. It is urgent to find measures that can avoid this progression to severe
      stages of the disease. We hypothesize that the use of anti-inflammatory drugs used at the
      time they start hyperinflammation episodes could improve symptoms and prognosis of patients
      and prevent their progression sufficiently to avoid their need for be admitted to an
      Intensive Care Unit.

             inclusion in the study:

               -  absolute neutrophil count less than 2000 / mm3;

               -  AST or ALT&gt; 5 times the upper limit of normality;

               -  platelets &lt;50,000 per mm3.

          3. In active treatment with immunosuppressants or previous prolonged treatment (more 3
             months) of oral corticosteroids for a disease not related to COVID-19 at a dose
             greater than 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent per day.

          4. Known active tuberculosis or known history of tuberculosis uncompleted treatment.

          5. Patients with active systemic bacterial and / or fungal infections.

          6. Patients who have received previous treatment with IL6 inhibitor (tocilizumab,
             sarilumab).

          7. Participants who, at the investigator's discretion, are not eligible to participate,
             regardless of the reason, including medical or clinical conditions, or participants
             potentially at risk of not following study procedures.

          8. Patients who do not have entry criteria in the Intensive Care Unit.

          9. Pregnancy or lactation.

         10. Known hypersensitivity to siltuximab or to any of its excipients (histidine, histidine
             hydrochloride, polysorbate 80 and sucrose).
