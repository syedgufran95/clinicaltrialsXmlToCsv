  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is a global major public health emergency that disproportionately affects patients
      with risk factors such as advanced age, heart and lung disease, diabetes, hypertension, as
      well as compromised immunity. Despite the recent worldwide emergence of this disease and its
      rapid progression to a pandemic, very little is known about the risks facing solid organ
      recipients. The study aims to elucidate the prevalence of symptomatic, subclinical, and
      asymptomatic infection in the transplanted population by assessing their immunological
      response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This will be studied seroepidemiologically in the whole
      cohort and retrospectively in transplanted patients admitted to hospital for COVID-19.

      Primary objective: to elucidate the cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the
      transplanted population related to symptoms and hospitalizations; to assess the magnitude of
      immunological response and seroconversion kinetics for COVID-19. Secondary objectives: To
      examine the influence of medical parameters on COVID-19 infection and immune response such
      as: age, comorbidities current and recent pharmacological treatment, organ transplanted, and
      blood type, HLA genotype.

      Study design:

      Part 1: Longitudinal cohort study for seroepidemiology and disease burden. Part 2:
      Retrospective case-series for seroconversion kinetics and clinical course assessment.

      Study population:

      All solid organ transplanted patients in the Transplant Institute, Sahlgrenska University
      hospital, catchment area.

      The study will assess the clinical course, the outcome, and the immunologic response of organ
      transplant patients who have had COVID-19 (participants); The investigators aim to study the
      development of the immune response to COVID-19 infection to see if participants on
      immunosuppressive treatment, will establish sufficient immunity to protect against
      reinfection. The findings among participants will be compared to a suitable control
      population. In addition, the investigators will identify patients in our cohort who are
      undergoing clinically apparent infections and study their clinical course and antibody
      response profile in the acute phase (seroconversion).

      Control groups: Other current studies with matched protocols and WHO pooled data.

      Overall study design Part 1: Potential participants are all patients who have undergone solid
      organ transplantation (SOT) at Sahlgrenska University Hospital or otherwise belong to the
      investigators' catchment area will be invited to participate in the longitudinal cohort
      seroprevalence part of the study (approximately 1000 patients will be included). This part of
      the study is a single-center longitudinal cohort study that will evaluate the development of
      antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in solid organ recipients at all stages after transplantation
      and study their disease course, complications, and death rate.

      The study has been designed to follow the best practices outlined by the WHO in their recent
      guidelines entitled &quot;Population-based age-stratified seroepidemiological investigation
      protocol for COVID-19 virus infection COVID-19 v1.1&quot;. This will allow a comparison of
      symptoms, outcomes, case fatality rate, as well as antibody titers and prevalence, with other
      relevant control groups. Participant enrollment will be allowed for a maximum of 2 years. The
      duration of the study will be two years from enrollment. The last participant will thus
      complete follow-up a maximum of 4 years after the commencement of the study Part 2: The
      investigators will also do a retrospective assessment of transplanted patients admitted to
      hospitals in our catchment area due to COVID-19.
