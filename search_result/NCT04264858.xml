  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The new coronavirus pneumonia is an acute infectious pneumonia. The pathogen is a previously
      unknown new coronavirus, namely 2019 new coronavirus (2019 novel coronavirus, 2019 nCoV).
      However, there is no specific anti-viral drug. It has been found that the specific antibodies
      against virus antigen are produced after these patients were cured, which could block the
      infection of 2019 nCoV on the host cells. At present, immunoadsorption is the most direct,
      rapid and effective method to separate immunoglobulin from the cured patients. Therefore, the
      study aims to prepare the immunoglobulin from 2019-ncov pneumonia cured patients, evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of the immunoglobulin in 2019-ncov pneumonia cured patients on the
      treatment of acute severe 2019-ncov pneumonia, and provide a new strategy for the treatment
      of 2019-ncov pneumonia.

    <description>TTCI is defined as the time (in days) from initiation of study treatment (active or placebo) until a decline of two categories from admission status on a six-category ordinal scale of clinical status which ranges from 1 (discharged) to 6 (death).
Six-category ordinal scale: 6. Death; 5. ICU, requiring ECMO and/or IMV; 4. ICU/hospitalization, requiring NIV/ HFNC therapy; 3. Hospitalization, requiring supplemental oxygen (but not NIV/ HFNC); 2. Hospitalization, not requiring supplemental oxygen; 1. Hospital discharge.
Abbreviation: IMV, invasive mechanical ventilation; NIV, non-invasive mechanical ventilation; HFNC, High-flow nasal cannula.</description>
