  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm open label trial for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (Coronavirus).
      The primary endpoint of the study is to assess the requirement for mechanical ventilation in
      patients who are admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 infection and a Pulse Oxygen Level
      &lt;/= 93% on room air. The primary endpoint analysis will be performed using all enrolled
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with COVID-19 who are admitted with respiratory distress will be considered for
      enrollment on this study. Patients will be screened and then if they meet eligibility
      criteria will be enrolled. Abatacept will be administered on Day 1 at a dose of 10 mg/kg.
      Patients will then be followed closely through 90 days post-treatment.
