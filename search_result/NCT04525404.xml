  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While many people with COVID-19 suffer from respiratory disease, there is growing evidence
      that the virus also affects other organs. The purpose of this study is to better understand
      the effects of COVID-19 on the lungs and other organs.

      The study investigators have developed new techniques in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to
      scan the lungs, heart, brain and liver. The study investigators hope to learn more about how
      the virus causes inflammation in these organs and how this inflammation changes over time as
      people recover from COVID-19 illness.

      The study aims to enroll 228 people in Alberta. Participants will undergo one or more MRI
      scans and have blood testing at one or more time points to assess for inflammation, kidney
      function, liver function and possible heart injury. Participants will also undergo testing to
      assess sense of smell, cognition (thinking and memory), spirometry (breathing test for lung
      function) and and exercise tolerance (walk test).

      The study investigators hope this study will help us learn more about the long-term risks of
      COVID-19 disease.

      Participants with newly or recently diagnosed COVID-19 infection (inpatients and outpatients)
      will undergo multi-organ MRI (heart, brain, lungs, kidney), blood work, and functional
      testing at one or more time points. Functional testing will include olfaction testing,
      cognitive testing, spiromety, and a walk test.

    <description>Myocardial T1 is a surrogate marker of myocardial edema and the most sensitive MRI measure of acute myocarditis. We will show that myocardial T1 at baseline is significantly higher than myocardial T1 at 12 weeks follow-up. At 12 weeks, we will also compare native myocardial T1 in patients with baseline elevated troponin to those with baseline normal troponin as well as healthy controls</description>
