  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is ideated to prospectively investigate in patients with severe acute
      respiratory syndrome (SARS) due to Coronavirus 19 (SARS-Cov-2) infection and moderate-severe
      respiratory failure the patterns and changes in platelet reactivity, thrombotic status and
      endothelial function. The observed patterns and changes will be related with inflammatory
      status, myocardial injury and outcomes

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary evidences suggested that patients with SARS-Cov-2 infection and concomitant
      presence of cardiovascular risk factors (i.e. arterial hypertension) and/or cardiovascular
      history (i.e. prior myocardial infarction) are at poor prognosis. The first reports from
      China suggested in patients with SARS-Cov-2 infection a heightened inflammatory burden
      associated with significant changes in coagulative status (i.e. low platelet count, increased
      D-dimer) and dysfunction of micro-vessels in pulmonary circulation.

      No data are available about patterns and changes in platelet reactivity, activation of
      coagulation factors and endothelial function during SARS-Cov-2 infection.

      The present study is ideated to fill this gap. Patients with moderate to severe respiratory
      failure due to SARS-Cov-2 infection will be enrolled. One blood sample will be obtained from
      each patient at the early, mid and late stage of disease. Several markers of platelet,
      coagulation and endothelial function will be related with laboratory, clinical,
      electrocardiographic, imaging (transthoracic echocardiogram, pulmonary ultrasonography,
      computed tomography) and outcome data.

      To better describe typical patterns of disease regarding inflammation, platelet function and
      coagulation alteration, data from cases will be compared with control groups negative for
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, but with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction or moderate-severe
      respiratory failure due to other agents.
