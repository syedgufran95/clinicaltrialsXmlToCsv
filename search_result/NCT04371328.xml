  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research aims to improve knowledge of the epidemiology of patients consulting in the
      COvid Possible REspiratory Units (RECOP unit). Indeed, the epidemic linked to COVID19 affects
      France and impacts its health system. The reception of all intermediate patients will be on
      the Emergency Structures (SU). Indeed, the French healthcare system centralizes unscheduled
      urgent care on the ER. The aspecific respiratory symptomatology in &quot;intermediate&quot; patients
      indicates them all the more at an admission to SU or the diagnostic approach to respiratory
      difficulty may be carried out. It will be necessary to identify the diagnosis of the dyspneic
      patient and to define his virological status COVID before referring him to the appropriate
      units.

      The investigatory propose an original strategy of dedicating entire care sectors to the care
      of patients admitted for dyspnea in our ER. These units will be named RECOP units.

      This study would improve epidemiological knowledge of COVID-19 and ability to receive these
      patients within the SU.
