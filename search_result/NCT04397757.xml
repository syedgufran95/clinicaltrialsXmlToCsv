  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if this plasma can be safely used in humans with COVID-19
      and to see if it improves patients' health as compared to not using it in patients with
      pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2.

      This open-label, randomized, controlled, phase 1 trial will assess the safety and efficacy of
      convalescent plasma in severely ill, hospitalized participants with pneumonia due to
      COVID-19. This study will enroll adults 18 years old and older, including pregnant women.

      A total of 80 eligible participants will be randomized to receive either 2 units of
      convalescent plasma collected from ABO-compatible donors who have recovered from COVID-19 and
      standard of care (treatment arm) or standard of care alone (control arm). Participants in the
      treatment arm will receive 2 units of convalescent plasma on Study Day 1 in addition to
      standard of care.

      Participants will be assessed on study Day 1 (pre-dose), 30 minutes after each unit of
      plasma, on all Study Days while hospitalized, and Study Days 15, 22, 29, and 60. All
      participants will undergo a series of safety and efficacy, assessments. Blood samples will be
      collected on Days 1 (prior to plasma administration), 3, 8, 15, 29, and 60. Oropharyngeal or
      endotracheal samples will be collected on Days 1 (prior to plasma administration), 3, 5, 8,
      11, and 15.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult ≥18 years of age

          2. Laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by PCR or other authorized or
             approved assay in any specimen collected within 72 hours prior to enrollment.

             Note - An exception must be requested to the Sponsor if ≥72 hours since positive test.

          3. Hospitalized in participating facility.

          4. Documentation of pneumonia with radiographic evidence of infiltrates by imaging (e.g.,
             chest x-ray or CT scan).

          5. Abnormal respiratory status that is judged worse than baseline by the investigator and
             as documented at any point within 24 hours prior to randomization, consistent with
             ordinal scale levels 5, 6 or 7, specifically defined as:

               -  Room air saturation of oxygen (SaO2) &lt; 93%, OR

               -  Requiring supplemental oxygen, OR

               -  Tachypnea with respiratory rate ≥30

          6. Patient or proxy is willing and able to provide written informed consent and comply
             with all protocol requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Contraindication to transfusion (e.g., severe volume overload, history of severe
             allergic reaction to blood products), as judged by the investigator.

          2. Clinical suspicion that the etiology of acute illness (acute decompensation) is
             primarily due to a condition other than COVID-19

          3. Receipt of other investigational therapy as a part of another clinical trial. Note:
             investigational therapies used as part of clinical care, (eg, remdesivir,
             hydroxychloroquine) are permissible.
