  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, there are no specific treatments for COVID-19. WHO recommends four treatments for
      COVID 19 with drugs i.eRemdesivir, Lopinavir/ ritonavir, Lopinavir/ ritonavir with interferon
      beta -1a, and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Currently, there are several ongoing
      clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. Recently, LeonCaly reported that Ivermectin,
      an FDA-approved anti-parasitic previously shown to have broad-spectrum anti-viral activity in
      vitro, is an inhibitor of the causative virus (SARS-CoV-2), with a single addition to
      Vero-hSLAM cells 2 hours post infection with SARSCoV-2 able to effect about 5000-fold
      reduction in viral RNA at 48 h. Ivermectin therefore warrant further investigation for
      possible benefits in humans. The study rationale is to understand the effect of the drug on
      eradication of virus.

      This study aims to confirm the antivirus effectiveness of Ivermectin on coronavirus i.e COVID
      19 then to explore its potential use in the combating to the COVID 19 pandemics.

      Enrollment of subject into the trial shall only occur after providing written permission to
      voluntarily participate into the study by signing and dating the informed consent form before
      starting any trial related treatment. 50 cases of COVID-19 will be enrolled into the trial.
      The trial shall be divided into two groups. First group with 25 confirmed cases of COVID 19
      shall be treated with Ivermectin 200 to 400 mcg per kg body weight on day 1 and day 2 along
      with standard treatment of the hospital protocol. The second group with 25 confirmed cases of
      COVID 19 shall be treated with standard treatment as per hospital protocol for COVID 19.
      Subjects in both the arms shall be followed up for recovery of death with regular monitoring
      as per below schedule.

        1. Test for virus at 1, 3 &amp; 5 days from beginning of trial drug started for the patient in
           the hospital

        2. Clinical profile of the patient every day of hospitalization

        3. Investigation of pulmonary function and oxygen saturation every day of hospitalization

        4. The day a patient is put on ventilator and the day when removed

        5. The day a patient develops acute respiratory distress syndrome and the day when relieved
           All the above data shall be collected on paper case record form for interim and final
           analysis from start of the trial i.e enrollment, treatment and follow-up. Viral test to
           monitor the eradication of Virus shall be done free of cost from third day of enrollment
           and providing the study drug on daily basis upto eradication of virus or completion of
           the trial
