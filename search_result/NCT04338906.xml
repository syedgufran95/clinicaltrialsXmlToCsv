      Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine - camostat combination therapy in
      hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19 infection, CLOCC-Trial Primary Objectives: The
      primary objective of this study is to demonstrate, that a combination therapy of
      hydroxychloroquine and camostat (Foipan®) is superior to hydroxychloroquine + placebo in
      participants with moderate COVID-19.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ongoing pandemic with the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) poses a massive threat to public
      health. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and may lead to severe acute respiratory distress
      syndrome in affected individuals. No therapeutic intervention has yet been approved for
      COVID-19, and initial interventional studies with single agents showed only minimal
      improvement in outcome or were not convincing in design. Therefore, the CLOCC trial will
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of a combination therapy consisting of hydroxychloroquine,
      which was used already as single agent with some effect, together with camostat mesylate in
      hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19 infection. The rationale for this combination
      therapy stems from the observation that hydroxychloroquine interferes with viral entry and
      replication through several mechanisms including changes in endosomal pH and in glycosylation
      of the ACE2 receptor, which serves as entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Camostat acts as
      inhibitor of the host cell serine protease TMPRSS2, which is needed to prime the viral S
      protein for cell entry. Participants will be recruited in a total of 6 German centers, and
      the trial will be randomized (1:1) and enrolled in either the hydroxychloroquine + placebo or
      the hydroxychloroquine + camostat arm (7-day treatment). The trial will be carried out in a
      double-blinded fashion. The primary efficacy outcome is the number of patients discharged by
      day 14 (status 1 and 2 of a 7-point ordinal clinical status scale). Several secondary
      outcomes regarding efficacy but also safety will be evaluated. Exploratory endpoints include
      analysis of viral titers and the emergence of viral resistance in response to therapy.
