  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Paris Fire Brigade staff have been particularly exposed to COVID-19 due to rescue and
      care activities for victims at risk in Paris area (where the virus was actively circulating).
      In addition, when the pandemic began in France, they had to take care of patients before
      procedures to protect caregivers were implemented.

      The contamination of young military personnel, whose physical capacity was put into strain at
      work, raises the question of the consequences of COVID-19 on their physical fitness. At the
      time, the medium- and long-term evolution of this disease and its possible repercussions on
      physical fitness are unknown. Moreover, like any soldiers who have been confined, they may
      present at least a cardio-respiratory deconditioning (sometimes independent of the disease
      making it difficult to distinguish between a sequelae of the infection or rehabilitation).

      Based on previous coronavirus epidemics (Sars-Cov 1 and Mers-Cov), it appears that long-term
      sequelae are possible even in mild forms and can result in an alteration of exertion ability.

      In the current context and in the absence of national or international recommendations on the
      return to physical activity, the French Armed Forces Health Service has proposed a simple
      management plan aiming at: i) allowing mass screening for possible exercise intolerance and
      targeting at-risk personnel, ii) allowing individualized re-training and iii) guaranteeing
      that military personnel can carry out their mission without jeopardizing their health.

    <measure>Magnitude of the decrease in aerobic performance on return to work</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Aerobic performance will be assessed through a test called VAMEVAL. VAMEVAL consists of running around a track marked out every 50 meters to the rhythm of a soundtrack that accelerates at a rate of 0.5 km/h in 2-minute increments until exhaustion or inability to maintain the pace of the race. The result of the test made on return to work will be compared to the last result on the same test performed before COVID-19 infection.</description>
