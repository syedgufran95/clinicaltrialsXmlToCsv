  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, randomized, and controlled clinical trial aims to determine the feasibility
      and effectiveness of using NBT-NM108, a novel botanical-based fixed-combination drug, to
      modulate the gut microbiota and treat early-stage suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in patients
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or prediabetes.
