        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection as
             determined using a molecular diagnostic test (reverse transcription polymerase chain
             reaction [RT-PCR] or equivalent) approved by regulatory authorities (including Food
             and Drug Administration or Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency) or allowed under an
             emergency use authorization within 14 days before Screening. If a false negative
             result is suspected, the SARS-CoV-2 test may be repeated within the Screening Period.

          -  Chest CT scan or X ray results confirming interstitial pneumonia

          -  Severe COVID 19 disease as evidenced by ≥ 1 of the following criteria at Screening
             including within 24 hours before Screening:

               -  Respiratory frequency &gt; 30 breaths per minute

               -  SpO2 ≤ 93% on room air

               -  Ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen
                  (PaO2/FiO2) &lt; 300

               -  Ratio of Arterial oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen (SaO2/FiO2
                  ratio) &lt; 218 (if PaO2/FiO2 ratio is not available)

               -  Radiographic lung infiltrates &gt; 50%

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently enrolled, planning to enroll, or participated, within the last 30 days, in a
             clinical study requiring administration of an IP, including expanded access or
             compassionate use with the only exception being administration of convalescent plasma.
             Administration of IP is permitted only if an emergency use authorization has been
             granted (eg, remdesivir). Additionally, off label use of approved drugs (eg, anti IL
             6/anti IL 6R) is also permitted.

             randomization

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, the subject is expected to be intubated in the
             first 24 hours after IMP administration

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, not expected to survive for &gt; 48 hours after
             admission

          -  Presence of any of the following comorbid conditions prior to randomization and prior
             to SARS CoV 2 infection:

               -  Severe heart failure (New York Heart Association Class IV)

               -  End stage renal disease (Stage ≥ 4) or need for renal replacement therapy

          -  Active bleeding or a current clinically significant coagulopathy (eg, international
             normalized ratio [INR] &gt; 1.5) or clinically significant risk for bleeding (eg, recent
             intracranial hemorrhage or bleeding peptic ulcer within the last 4 weeks)

          -  History of venous thrombosis, myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular event within 3
             months, or a prothrombotic disorder (eg, antithrombin III, protein C or protein S
             deficiency)

          -  Known or suspected Grade 3 or 4 infusion-related reaction or hypersensitivity (per
             Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE]) to monoclonal antibody
             therapy, or hypersensitivity to the IMP or any excipients of the IMP

          -  Currently receiving a therapy not permitted during the study.

          -  Female subject of childbearing potential or fertile male subject either not using or
             not willing to use an acceptable method of contraception to avoid pregnancy during the
             study and for 90 days after receipt of the last dose of IMP

          -  Any clinical or laboratory abnormality or other underlying conditions (eg,
             psychological disorders, substance abuse) that would render the subject unsuitable for
             participation in the study, in the opinion of the investigator

    <ipd_description>CSL will consider requests to share Individual Patient Data (IPD) from systematic review groups or bona-fide researchers. For information on the process and requirements for submitting a voluntary data sharing request for IPD, please contact CSL at clinicaltrials@cslbehring.com.
Applicable country specific privacy and other laws and regulations will be considered and may prevent sharing of IPD.
If the request is approved and the researcher has executed an appropriate data sharing agreement, IPD that has been appropriately anonymized will be available.</ipd_description>

    <ipd_access_criteria>Requests may only be made by systematic review groups or bona-fide researchers whose proposed use of the IPD is non-commercial in nature and has been approved by an internal review committee.
An IPD request will not be considered by CSL unless the proposed research question seeks to answer a significant and unknown medical science or patient care question as determined by CSL's internal review committee.
