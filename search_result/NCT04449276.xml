             considered highly effective when used consistently and correctly:

               -  Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated
                  with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal or transdermal);

               -  Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation
                  (oral, injectable or implantable);

             vaccine within 28 days of trial vaccine administration.

          -  Receipt of any investigational SARS-CoV-2 or other CoV vaccine prior to the
             administration of the trial vaccine.

          -  Any treatment with immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within 6 months
             prior to the administration of the trial vaccine or planned use during the trial, with
