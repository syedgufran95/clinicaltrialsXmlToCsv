  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, one couple in eight encounters difficulties to conceive. The diagnosis of
      infertility frequently leads to symptoms of anxiety and depression. These symptoms appear to
      be higher than in the general population.

      Some recent studies have looked at the relationship between anxiety and depression in ART
      cares.

      Results are controversial, but it appears that patients with lower levels of anxiety and
      depression have higher pregnancy rates. Moreover, in couple, women seem to have more symptoms
      of anxiety and depression than men.

      First epidemiological studies related to the COVID 19 pandemic have shown strong
      psychological impact on the general population with an anxiety rate estimated at more than
      30%.

      With COVID 19 pandemic and cessation of ART, it is highly likely that psychic symptoms of
      anxiety or even depression may have appeared or worsened in women undergoing infertility
      treatment.
