  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), is a single-stranded RNA coronavirus. The virus was first
      isolated from patients presented with pneumonia in Wuhan in December 2019. Sequences of the
      Wuhan betacoronavirus show similarities to betacoronaviruses found in bats, sharing a common
      ancestor with the 2003 SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the bat coronavirus HKU9, a virus
      found in fruit bats. Similar to SARS-CoV, it is a member of Beta-CoV lineage B. Five genomes
      of the novel coronavirus have been initially isolated and reported including
      BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-01/2019, BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-04/2020, BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-05/2019,
      BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019, and BetaCoV/Wuhan/IPBCAMS-WH-01/2019 from the China CDC.

      The SARS-CoV-2 has since spread from China to the rest of the world. As of 5 April 2020, more
      than 1.05 million people been confirmed to have infected by SARS-CoV-2, resulting in more
      than 500,000 deaths. No specific antiviral treatment for the SARS-CoV-2 is currently
      available, but existing medication could be repurposed.

      Genetic sequencing demonstrated similarity of the SARS-CoV-2 to the SARS-CoV and MERS CoV.2
      We expect patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 will also present similarly with initial
      upper respiratory tract symptoms including fever, cough, sputum, myalgia and shortness or
      breath. More severe cases might complicate with pneumonia and required ventilatory or ECMO
      support. According to our previous studies in 2003 on patients hospitalized for severe
      SARS-CoV, the viral load peaked between day 7 from symptoms onset and coincided with clinical
      deterioration of pneumonia and respiratory failure, with majority of the patients required
      intensive care support. Higher viral load isolated from different human system also
      correlated with worsened SARS manifestation and complications.

      Previously, the investigators have demonstrated that interferon-beta 1b, commonly used in the
      treatment of multiple sclerosis and lopinavir/ ritonavir, also demonstrated to improve the
      outcome of MERS-CoV infection in a non-human primate model of common marmoset.

      A non-randomized trial has also suggested that a combination of hydroxychloroquine and
      azithromycin might be effective in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 viral load in patients, despite
      in-vitro activity was only found in hydroxychloroquine.

      Therefore, the investigators propose to conduct an open-label randomized controlled trial on
      a short course of interferon β-1b and hydroxychloroquine combination treatment for patients
      hospitalized for COVID-19 infection.

      This is a prospective open-label randomised controlled trial among adult patients
      hospitalised after April 2020 for virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to either the treatment group: a 3-day course of 3 doses
      of subcutaneous injection of interferon β-1b 1mL (0.25mg; 8 million IU) consecutively on day
      1 to day 3 and hydroxychloroquine 800mg on day 1, then 400mg daily for 2 days plus standard
      care, or the control group: a 3-day course of hydroxycholoroquine 800mg on day 1, then 400mg
      daily for 2 days plus standard care alone (1:1).

      For the control group, if the day 4 nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) viral load remains positive,
      then patients will receive another 3 days of subcutaneous injection of interferon β-1b 1mL
      (0.25mg; 8 million IU) and hydroxychloroquine 400mg daily.
