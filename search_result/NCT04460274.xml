  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease-19 (Covid-19) had an unprecedented effect on both nations and health
      systems. Time series modeling using Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA) models
      have been used to forecast variables extensively mainly in statistics and econometrics. The
      investigators aimed to predict the total number of cases for Covid-19 using ARIMA models of
      time-series analysis.

    <textblock>
      Coronavirus Disease 19 (Covid-19) is an infectious disease initially defined in December 2019
      before becoming pandemic. Respiratory disease is the main form of disease causing acute
      respiratory distress as the main cause of death.

      Increased number of cases worldwide had put an enormous load on public health resulting
      lockdowns, quarantines and curfews. Predicting number of cases is hard as the increment of
      cases between communities differ.

      Time series had been used in different fields of science to predict, such as signal
      processing, mathematical finance, weather prediction. In medicine, time series analysis were
      used in number of admitted patients to hospitals. Aim of this study is to predict the total
      number of Covid-19 cases worldwide using time series anaylsis.
