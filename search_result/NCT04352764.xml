      This study will be conducted as a registry to identify asymptomatic or symptomatic persons to
      determine whether they carry SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The blood test data will be collected as
      allowed by the EUA using the CoronaCideTM COVID-19 IgM/IgG Rapid Test and the Premier Biotech
      COVID-19 IgM/IgG Rapid Test. Both COVID-19 IgM/IgG Rapid Tests are intended for
      Over-The-Counter/Professional use as a screening aid in the diagnosis of primary and
      secondary SARSCoV-2 infections, and are only for use under the FDA's EUA.

      The RNA test data will be collected via a nasopharyngeal swab and processed using the Abbott
      ID NOW COVID-19 diagnostic test.

    <description>The tests are being distributed under section IV.D of the current United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) policies for diagnostic tests for coronavirus disease 2019. The test is available under an emergency access mechanism called an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). The EUA is supported by the Secretary of Health and Human Service's (HHS's) declaration that circumstances exist to justify the emergency use of in vitro diagnostics (IVDs) for the detection and/or diagnosis of the virus that causes COVID-19</description>
