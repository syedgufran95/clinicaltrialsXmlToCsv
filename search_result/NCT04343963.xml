  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will evaluate low-dose pyridostigmine as add-on therapy to best medical care in patients
      with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and its related
      Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) who require hospitalization. Our hypothesis is that, in
      comparison to the placebo, pyridostigmine will reduce in at least 10% a composite outcome
      [death; mechanical ventilation; &gt;2 point-increase in the SOFA score) by day 28. We will also
      evaluate interleukin (IL)-6 kinetics during the first 14 days of in-hospital stay.

      It is estimated that 25-33% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 are admitted to intensive
      care units (ICU) for severe hypoxemia. The reported mortality in those with severe disease
      ranges between 38% and 49%. So far, there is no pharmacological therapeutic (or else)
      strategy known to reduce morbidity and mortality in these patients. Mortality in COVID-19
      appears to be mediated not necessarily by the direct effect of the infection, but by the
      disproportionate inflammatory response of the host.

      Pyridostigmine is an old drug that, by inhibiting acetylcholine-esterase, the enzymatic
      machinery that degrades acetylcholine (ACh), results in increased ACh bioavailability. ACh,
      in turn, ligates to nicotinic-alpha7 receptors in macrophages and T cells, resulting in
      reduced overactivation of these immune cells. In experimental murine sepsis, this family of
      drugs has resulted in reduced inflammation and mortality. Human evidence is scarce for severe
      inflammatory conditions. However, recent evidence from our group and others indicates that
      pyridostigmine has an immunomodulatory effect in people living with HIV, resulting in
      elevation of CD4+ T cell counts, decreased immune activation, and reduction in inflammatory
      mediators. Altogether, this suggests that ACh-esterase inhibitors may act as immunomodulators
      during viral infections, potentially reducing the inflammatory cascade (the so-called
      &quot;cytokine storm&quot;) observed in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

      At the proposed dose (60mg/d), the rate of minor adverse events is less than 5% with no
      reported serious adverse effects. From that perspective, we consider that pyridostigmine can
      function as an immuno-modulator and reduce morbidity and mortality in COVID-19-stricken
      patients, with the added value of a safe pharmacological profile. Moreover, as an old drug,
      re-purposing it for a novel indication may be a simpler, more efficient approach than
      developing a novel one from the ground up.

      The study will be divided into two phases, each with different variables to evaluate, as
      described below:

      The primary objective of the first phase (proof-of-concept) will be to evaluate the effect of
      pyridostigmine on the serum level of interleukin (IL)-6 as an indicator of severe
      inflammation, as well as its kinetics throughout the days that the patient is hospitalized.

      In the first phase, we will evaluate the safety and feasibility of the study in a
      representative sample and we will explore in a preliminary way the magnitude of the effect of
      the intervention. Safety will be evaluated according to the adverse effects reported in
      patients with acute intoxication (accidental or in suicide attempt) with pyridostigmine:

        1. Abdominal pain/cramps

        2. Diarrhea

        3. Vomiting, nausea, or both

        4. Hypersalivation

        5. Urinary incontinence

        6. Fasciculations or muscle weakness

        7. Blurred vision

      In the second phase (to be carried out only if the results of the first phase justify it),
      the primary outcome to be evaluated is mortality, the requirement of invasive or non-invasive
      mechanical ventilation, or an increase in the SOFA scale ≥2 points.

      The following secondary outcomes were evaluated: changes in the total SOFA score between
      study entry and evaluation at 3, 7, and 14 days; the number of days of hospital stay, days of
      hospitalization in the intensive care unit, and the need (and if applicable, the number of
      days required) for invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation.

      The variables to measure are sex, age at hospitalization, date of COVID-19 diagnosis, date
      and SOFA scale measurement, date of hospitalization, date of transfer to the intensive care
      unit, date of initiation of mechanical ventilation. , date and reason for leaving the
      intensive care unit.
