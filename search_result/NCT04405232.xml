  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection leading to pneumonia and severe acute respiratory
      failure [acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)] and death is a global threat. On
      11/03/2020, WHO declared the Covid-19 outbreak a global pandemic. As of 18th of March, there
      are 202,309 confirmed cases with 8,013 deaths. Patients with severe illness may develop
      dyspnoea and hypoxemia within 1week after onset, which may quickly progress to ARDS or
      end-organ failure 1. Based on Chinese data abnormal coagulation parameters (Prolonged
      Prothrombin time [PT] and raised D dimer) are reported to predict a poor prognosis and may
      therefore be important therapeutic targets. The number of patients with infected with COVID-
      19 in UK is rapidly rising as with many other European countries. Eventually &gt;50% of people
      will have become infected and COVID-19 will remain a public health threat in the long term.
      It is therefore very important to understand every aspect of this disease, including the
      associated coagulopathy leading bleeding, blood clots (thrombosis) and death. Emerging data
      from Europe and some centres in UK, indicates that venous thromboembolism (VTE), mainly
      pulmonary embolism (PE), is major problem in COVID patients. In this
      retrospective-prospective: multicentre study, investigators will document the patient
      characteristics, presenting haematological parameters and associated comorbidities and their
      association with bleeding, thrombosis and mortality in patients admitted for hospital
      treatment. Determining the predictive value of patient characteristics and presenting
      laboratory measurements for clinical outcomes in these patients will allow us to optimise
      management of these patients in the future. Furthermore, by comparing these data with data
      from patients without Covid-19, investigators will be able to modify existing protocols and
      tailor them to the management of COVID -19.
