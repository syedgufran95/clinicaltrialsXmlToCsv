  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to test whether an online, self-administered SSI designed to
      strengthen perceived control over anxiety in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic (Contain
      COVID Anxiety) increases perceived control over anxiety more than a placebo,
      hand-washing-plan SSI (Remain COVID Free) in a weighted-probability sample of the United
      States (N = 500).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elevations in state anxiety, when moderate and temporary, serve an adaptive function in
      pandemic contexts, facilitating health behaviors like self-protection and social distancing.
      However, for some people elevated state anxiety transitions to anxiety disorders, creating
      undue suffering and impairment. Nearly 33% of both Wuhan residents and Chinese citizens
      screened positive for generalized anxiety disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic, with
      uncontrollable, persistent COVID-19-related worries strongly predicting presence of GAD.
      Similarly, large surveys indicate that levels of anxiety symptoms are rising among United
      States citizens.

      This finding aligns with a large body of literature indicating stronger perceived control
      over one's own anxiety buffers against a variety of anxiety disorders. Thus, in the context
      of COVID-19, there is a pressing need for materials that might strengthen perceived control
      over anxiety, thereby reducing risk for anxiety disorder onset. Ideally, such materials would
      (1) in no way undermine positive health behaviors, like social distancing, and (2) have
      capacity for broad-scale, immediate accessibility. Internet-based interventions may
      particularly valuable during the pandemic stage of COVID-19 due to the need for social
      distancing, and they have already scaled up to address needs in China. However, drop out from
      internet-based interventions can be up to 83% and intervention engagement is a frequent
      issue. Fortunately, single-session experiences (SSEs) can improve mental health related
      outcomes with similar effect sizes as multi-session therapies, and pilot data from our team
      suggests they can increase general perceived control (within-group dz = 0.70).

      The goal of this project is to test a web-based platform where people can confidentially
      access and provide feedback on brief activities, called 'single-session experiences' (SSEs),
      which are about 8 minutes in length, entirely self-administered, and computer-based (Contain
      COVID Anxiety and Project Remain COVID Free). Previous activities following the same best
      practices as these experiences have been shown to be safe to complete; predicted significant
      reductions in psychological distress; and are entirely self-administered. We will recruit a
      weighted-probability sample of the United States through Prolific's online platform, N = 500.
      All data collected from the SSEs will be confidential, and the only identifiable information
      that will be recorded is the participants' Prolific ID to facilitate compensation, which will
      be deleted from the data after the compensation has been paid. Those that choose to complete
      the activities have the option to submit their advice to their peers and have it posted
      anonymously to the web-based platform. This will provide people with an option for an easily
      accessible activity designed to promote healthy coping skills and resilience in a welcoming
      environment through which they can learn with others and share experiences.

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>This randomization of the order will occur using the randomizer within Qualtrics Survey Software, making the randomization process double-blind. To triple-blind our analysis process, the data will be downloaded from Qualtrics and the variable indicating what order the SSIs were presented in will be recoded before the primary analyses are conducted. Therefore, the primary analyses will be conducted without the knowledge of which condition is which.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Anxiety Control Questionnaire (ACQ) from Baseline to Immediately Post-Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately post-intervention, 2-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>ACQ is a 30-item questionnaire that measures an individual's level of agreement with a set of beliefs. Each item is scored on a scale from 0 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) based on how much the statement is typical of the individual. The questionnaire measures domains of emotion control, threat control, and stress control, but only the emotion control scale (4 questions) will be used for the purposes of this study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) from Baseline to 2-week follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7 asks participants to rate 7 statements based on how generally anxious they have felt over the past 2 weeks. Participants rate the 7 statements on a 4 point scale ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 3 (Nearly every day). Total score ranges from 0 to 21 with higher scores representing higher generalized anxiety.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Activity Social Distancing Intentions - 3 item version (SOC-D) from Baseline to immediately post-intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>As validated measures for social distancing intentions do not yet exist, the 3 questions used in this measure are derived from the standardized item bank provided by the Center for Disease Control. The three questions ask participants to rate how long they believe others would be willing to engage in social distancing behaviors regarding large events, public spaces, and private gatherings. Participants rate the 3 statements on a 4 point scale ranging from 1 (Less than a Month) to 4 (4 months or more). Total score ranges from 4 to 12, with a higher score indicating greater levels of intention to socially distance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>COVID-19 Related Questions</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Derived from the CDC COVID-19 Community Survey Question Bank, participants will be asked to report whether they have been tested for COVID-19, tested positive for COVID-19, and displayed symptoms of COVID-19 in the past week. The questions also ask how the COVID-19 outbreak affected the participant in the past two weeks and if the children's schools are currently closed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The IDAS is a screening tool for depression and panic disorder that asks people to rate how they have been feeling and acting in the past two weeks. Only the dysphoria subscale will be used; the subscale consists of 10 statements which the participants rate on a 1 (Not at all) to 5 (Extremely). Total score ranges from 10 to 50 for Dysphoria.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self Hate Scale (SHS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This brief measure asks participants to rate 7 statements measuring feelings of self-hatred on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Not at all true for me) to 7 (Very true for me). Total score ranges from 7 to 49 with higher scores indicating higher levels of self hate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comprehension Questions</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Two multiple choice questions developed for the purpose of the study to serve as a quality check that ensures participants comprehended the core messages of both interventions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Everyday Discrimination Scale-Short version</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The 5-item measure assesses chronic and routine unfair treatment in daily life on a scale from 1 - 5, with a total score between 5 and 25</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Changes in generalized anxiety symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>2-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>One question designed for use in this study. Participants rate their perceived changes in levels of generalized anxiety symptoms over 2 weeks from 1 (Much less anxiety) to 5 (much more anxiety)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activity Hand Washing Intentions - 3 item version (WASH-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This scale asks participants to rate 3 statements based on their intentions to engage in hand washing behaviors. Participants rate the 3 statements on a 7 point scale ranging from 1 (Strongly Agree) to 7 (Strongly Disagree). Total score ranges from 3 to 21, and will be reverse scored so a higher score indicates greater levels of intention to engage in recommended hand washing behaviors.</description>
