  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since December 2019, China and then the rest of the world have been affected by the rapid
      spread of a new coronavirus infection called SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus), the clinical expression of which is called Covid-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019).

      It is estimated that around 20% of symptomatic patients will be severe enough to warrant
      hospitalization, of which around 5% will be in intensive care.

      Organ damage is multiple in Covid infection: respiratory, digestive, renal, neurological,
      cardiovascular due to the infection or its care. There is also a psychological and social
      impact of the infection or of the care that should be measured.

      In this context, investigator will assess the physical and psychological complaints of
      patients who have presented a severe form of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      The final objective being to identify the needs to offer follow-up adapted to this emerging
      pathology.
