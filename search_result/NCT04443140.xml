    <textblock>
      By applying polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for Covid-19 to preeclampsia patients who
      applied to our hospital during the Covid-19 pandemic period, we investigated the frequency of
      Covid-19 related preeclampsia-like syndrome in this patient group.

    <textblock>
      The investigators studied the frequency of Covid-19 related preeclampsia-like syndrome by PCR
      test and lung ultrasound for Covid-19 to preeclampsia patients presenting to the instutution
      during the Covid-19 pandemic period. The first consecutive 100 preeclampsia patients
      presented to our hospital during the pandemic will be involved in our study. The primary
      outcome measure is to detect Covid-19 positivity among the preeclamptic pregnant women..
