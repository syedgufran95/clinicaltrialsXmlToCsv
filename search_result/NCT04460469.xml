    <textblock>
      Covid-19, the infection caused by a novel corona virus detected in December 2019 in Wuhan
      (Hubei province), is now a pandemic announced by World Health Organization, raising concerns
      of widespread panic and increasing anxiety in individuals. This outbreak results in mass
      quarantine in Egypt since middle of March 2020. Brooks et al. (2019) reviewed and reported
      quarantine could bring &quot;post traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger. Stressors
      included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate
      supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma.&quot;. Many universities decided to
      suspend in-person classes and evacuate students in responding to the intensifying concerns
      surrounding Covid-19. This action can lead to negative psychological consequences among
      college students. Oral health related behavior and attitudes habits correlate with oral
      health status and can be considered to be its predictors . There is a claim of potential
      connection between high bacterial load in the mouth and complications associated with
      Covid-19 infection. Bacteria present in the meta genome of patients severely infected with
      Covid-19 included high reads for Prevotella, Staphylococcus, and Fusobacterium, all usually
      commensal organisms of the mouth. Over 80% of patients in ICU exhibited an exceptionally high
      bacterial load. Accordingly, the investigators assume that good oral hygiene better to be
      maintained during a Covid-19 outbreak in order to reduce the bacterial load in the mouth and
      the risk of a bacterial super infection in case of catching the infection .

      While there seems to be a common belief that psychosocial stress affects oral hygiene
      behavior, this assumption has rarely been proved9 Dental students, as the future providers of
      dental care, are exÂ¬pected to be role models for their patients regarding the oral hygiene
      practice and they supposed to be aware of the importance of preserving the oral health. Thus,
      we intended to select them as our population to study how the level of anxiety during
      pandemic could affect the practice of oral hygien
