  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since december 2019, acute respiratory disease due to 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
      emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. There is no confirmed antivirus
      therapy for 2019-nCoV infection. Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that may
      serve as useful effectors against danger infection. The purpose of this clinical
      investigation is to evaluate the safety and efficiency of NK Cells in combination with
      standard therapy for pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV.
