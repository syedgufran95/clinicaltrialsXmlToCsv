  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 disease is an unprecedented global
      emergency. COVID-19 appears to be a disease with an early phase where the virus replicates,
      coinciding with first presentation of symptoms, followed by a later 'inflammatory' phase
      which results in severe disease in some individuals. It is known from other rapidly
      progressive infections such as sepsis and influenza that early treatment with antimicrobials
      is associated with better outcome. The trial will be conducted in key workers who are at high
      risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection and their household members. Apart from the risk of
      severe illness and death in the workers themselves and their household members, this
      phenomenon also impacts health system staffing levels. The objective of the FLARE trial is to
      assess whether early antiviral therapy with either favipiravir + Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r),
      LPV/r or favipiravir is associated with a decrease in viral load compared with placebo.The
      hypothesis is that this holds for COVID-19 and that early antiviral treatment may prevent
      progression to the later phase of the disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      FLARE is a phase IIA randomised, double-blind, 2x2 factorial placebo-controlled,
      interventional trial in which 240 participants, aged 18 years (â‰¥ 18 years) to 70 years old
      inclusive will be recruited. Participants will be key workers and their household members who
      have developed the early symptoms of COVID-19 within the first 5 days, or tested positive for
      SARS-CoV-2 within the first 7 days of symptom onset, or not presenting symptoms but tested
      positive within the last 48 hours (date/time of test must be within 48 hours of enrolment).

      Eligible participants will be randomised 1:1:1:1 to receive one of the following
      combinations:

      Favipiravir + Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) (both active); Favipiravir active +
      Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) placebo; Favipiravir placebo + Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)
      active; Favipiravir placebo + Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) placebo;

      All participants will be enrolled and followed up for 28 days. A saliva sample for
      virological analysis and safety blood samples will be collected at baseline, as well as a
      diagnostic nose and throat swab, if the participant hasn't been tested for COVID-19 yet.
      Following randomisation, participants will take trial medication for 7 days and during this
      period will take a daily saliva sample and complete a symptoms diary including four daily
      temperature measurements.

      Participants will have two follow-up visits at Day 7 and Day 14 where they will be assessed
      and undergo blood tests for toxicity and pharmacokinetic assessment (on Day 7 only) and
      provide stool samples. Participants will have a telephone follow up three (3) weeks after
      their last day of treatment (Day 7) and further information will be collected through a
      questionnaire.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Key workers and their household members with the following:

               -  Symptoms compatible with COVID-19 disease (Fever &gt;37.8oC on at least one occasion
                  AND either cough and/ or anosmia) within the first 5 days of symptom onset

               -  OR ANY symptoms compatible with COVID-19 disease (may include, but are not
                  limited to fever, cough, shortness of breath, malaise, myalgia, headache, coryza)
                  and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within the first 7 days of symptom onset

               -  OR no symptoms but tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within the last 48 hours
                  (date/time of test must be within 48 hours of enrolment)

          2. Male or female aged 18 years to 70 years old inclusive at screening

          3. Willing and able to take daily saliva samples

          4. Able to provide full informed consent and willing to comply with trial-related
             procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known hypersensitivity to any of the active ingredients or excipients in favipiravir
             and matched placebo, and in lopinavir/ritonavir and matched placebo

          2. Chronic liver disease at screening (known cirrhosis of any aetiology, chronic
             hepatitis (e.g. autoimmune, viral, steatohepatitis), cholangitis or any known
             elevation of liver aminotransferases with AST or ALT &gt; 3 X ULN)*

          3. Chronic kidney disease (stage 3 or beyond) at screening: eGFR &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73m2*

          4. HIV infection, if untreated, detectable viral load or on protease inhibitor therapy

          5. Any clinical condition which the investigator considers would make the participant
             unsuitable for the trial

          6. Concomitant medications known to interact with favipiravir and matched placebo, and
             with lopinavir/ritonavir and matched placebo, and carry risk of toxicity for the
             participant

          7. Current severe illness requiring hospitalisation

          8. Pregnancy and/ or breastfeeding

          9. Eligible female participants of childbearing potential and male participants with a
             partner of childbearing potential not willing to use highly effective contraceptive
             measures during the trial and within the time point specified following last trial
             treatment dose.

         10. Participants enrolled in any other interventional drug or vaccine trial (co-enrolment
             in observational studies is acceptable).

               -  Considering the importance of early treatment of COVID-19 to impact viral load,
                  the absence of chronic liver/ kidney disease will be confirmed verbally by the
                  participant during pre-screening and Screening/Baseline visit. Safety blood
                  samples will be collected at Screening/Baseline visit (Day 1) and test results
                  will be examined as soon as they become available within 24 hours.
