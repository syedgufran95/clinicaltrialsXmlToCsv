  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical specimens are collected from individuals either recovered from or with active
      SARS-CoV-2 infection to support process and analytical development for a potential cell-based
      immunotherapy in preclinical research, SRPH-CVD-01.

      SRPH-CVD-01 is an allogeneic cell-based immunotherapy candidate to be investigated in a
      subsequent clinical trial under a future FDA IND to treat people suffering from COVID-19.

      Enrolled participants provide a venous blood specimen (up to 40mL) to be used in preclinical
      studies and research and development of SRPH-CVD-01. Subjects may eventually be asked to
      undergo leukapheresis for peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) collection and their
      specimens will be used to further develop the SRPH-CVD-01 cell product, including a cGMP
      compliant process to be applied under the future FDA IND.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is to collect blood and PBMC specimens from individuals with active of past
      COVID-19 infection. The first blood draw will be done at the first study visit and if
      eligible, the second collection will be done via leukapheresis at the second visit. The
      leukapheresis procedures will follow the facility's standard operating procedures and
      protocol requirements for leukapheresis.

      Donors will be males or females between and including the ages of 18 years and 60 years.
      Volunteers will provide written informed consent and meet all inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. Each participant can be in the study for up to 180 days (6 months).

      The study will be conducted in accordance with human research for the purposes of obtaining
      clinical specimens for research. There is no endpoint for this study, however, data collected
      from this study will include, but not be limited to, gender, demographics, medical history,
      clinical laboratory values, and volume of the blood collected. The data will be summarized in
      future studies reporting results from a future clinical trial under FDA IND.

    <description>After the initial venous blood draw, the blood samples will be tested to measure the absolute count and percentage of B cells, monocytes, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, gammadelta T (gdT) cells, CD3+CD56+ natural killer T (NKT) cells, and natural killer (NK) cells in total PBMCs.
Data will describe the range of each cell population across participants.</description>

    <description>Innate immune system cells (gdT, NKT, and NK) will be assessed for their SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity by stimulation and immunophenotyping.
Data will report the antiviral phenotypic characteristics of these cells.</description>

    <description>Virus-specific innate immune cells that are relevant to SRPH-CVD-01 clinical product candidate will be expanded under various conditions to assess their therapeutic and protective potential against COVID-19. Data will report the expansion rate of SRPH-CVD-01 cells.
These cell will also help validate the assays and processes for the development of the SRPH-CVD-01 cell product to be used in a future clinical trials.</description>
