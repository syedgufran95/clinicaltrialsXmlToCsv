  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of atypical
      emerging pneumonia. The clinical spectrum varies from an asymptomatic or mild illness to a
      serious illness with a high risk of mortality. The most severely affected patients (5%)
      present an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring assistance with mechanical
      ventilation in intensive care.

      In 2003, persistent lung damage was observed in a third of patients in a Singaporean cohort
      one year after SARS-CoV infection. A Chinese study showed that 27.3% of their SARS-CoV
      patients presented a decreased carbon monoxide diffusion (DLCO) and 21.5% of pulmonary
      fibrosis lesions.

      Due to the very recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2, no data is currently available of long-term
      outcome of these patients. However, recent publications including short-term CT monitoring
      suggest the genesis of fibrotic pulmonary parenchymal sequelae.

      In view of these data, the investigators can fear the occurrence of pulmonary sequelae in
      patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. It is therefore essential to evaluate the evolution of the
      respiratory status of the most severe patients who have had a stay in intensive care with
      respiratory assistance.
