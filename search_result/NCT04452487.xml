  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This survey is performed to examine if during the Covid's crisis, the practitionner's have
      respected the modalities of the law about the end of life, in particular concerning
      limitations and stop of therapeutics
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the current legislativ context notably the Clayes Leonetti law, a very large majority of
      ICU (Intensive Care Unit) patients die with the establishement of a procedure for the
      limitation and cessation of therapeutics (LAT). During a viral pandemic, medical resources
      can be saturated, limiting reflexive abilities in favour of binary decisions. This sorting of
      patients leads to LAT that could be performed without the elementary modalities stated by the
      law. Thus, arbitrary medical decisions made alone could expose patients to unjustified &quot; loss
      of luck &quot;. Increasing the resources mobilized during a pandemic must not make us forget the
      quality of care provided for the benefit of quantity. In therefore seems legitimate to keep
      the LAT modalities to ensure our ethical principles. No work in the literature based on
      actual facts explores the impact of a pandemic on compliance with and maintenance of ethical
      principles and the legisltaive framework, in particular as regards the procedures of the
      application of LAT.

      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the terms of the LAT are being complied during
      a pandemic for patients with or without Covid.

    <description>The conformity of the modalities of the decisions of limitations and therapeutic stops will be evaluated by a composite criterion defined by the simultaneous presence of the 3 main modalities imposed by the Clayes-Leonetti law to achieve a limitation that are : An outside consultant's opinion ( required if no advance directives), the caregiver collegial discussion or adherence to patient advance directives, notification of decision in the medical record</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Hospitalized major patient

          -  Infected or not with Covid-19

          -  having a management with a LAT defined by an anticipated or factual restriction of a
             therapeutic resource ( organ replacement, specific treatment) while his or her state
             of health requires or may require it, leading or not a death. The patient's death
             occurs either after a cariac massagewhich corresponds to a maximum management with
             therapeutic failure or within the framework or in the context of brain death, in these
             cases there is no LAT ; either without cardiac massage and in this case there is de
             facto a LAT wether or not it is performed according to legisltaive procedures. All
             patients who die will beclassified according to this diagram for the inclusion
             criterion. For surviving patients, an analysis of the record in search of LAT elments
             will be performed. In the absence of LAT elment in the record, i twill be considered
             that the patient did not have LAT and therfore will not be included.
