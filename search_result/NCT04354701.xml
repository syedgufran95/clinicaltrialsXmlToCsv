  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we will collect granular information on cancer patients infected with COVID-19,
      as rapidly as possible. The mechanism for collection of this information is a de-identified
      centralized registry housed at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, with data donations from
      internal and external health care professionals.

      The COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) registry prospectively collects anonymized data
      about patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and cancer. The goal of the registry is to generate
      hypothesis-generating and hypothesis-supporting findings that are generalizable to the
      population at large. Specifically:

      I. Characterize patient factors, such as pre-existing comorbidities, baseline medication
      exposures, cancer type, status, and treatment, and demographic factors that are associated
      with short- and long-term outcomes of COVID-19 (laboratory-confirmed or presumptive),
      including severity and fatality, in patients with cancer.

      II. Describe cancer treatment modifications made in response to COVID-19, including dose
      adjustments, changes in symptom management, or temporary or permanent cessation.

      III. Evaluate the association of COVID-19 with cancer outcomes.
