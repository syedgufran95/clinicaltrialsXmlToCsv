    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized trial of maintenance versus reduction in immunosuppression in adult
      patients (age &gt;18 years old) with functioning renal transplants admitted to hospital with
      confirmed COVID-19 disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The optimal management of immunosuppression in renal transplant patients with COVID-19
      disease is unclear. On one hand, many centers advocate reduction of immunosuppression in
      infected patients, with the rationale that such an approach will unleash the anti-viral
      T-cell response. However, on the other hand, some centers advocate there may be rationale to
      maintain baseline immunosuppression in order to mitigate against development of an
      uncontrolled over-activation of the immune response. The investigators propose to address
      this knowledge gap by performing a randomized clinical trial that will test formal
      comparisons of maintenance versus reduction in immunosuppression.
