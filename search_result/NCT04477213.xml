      The investigators propose to conduct a retrospective study to define and quantify the
      variable occupational and non-occupational risk among various HCWs who got COVID-19 . The
      investigators aim to determine the rates of acquisition of COVID-19, in the context of level
      of exposure , adequacy of PPE use and other infection control measuresrecommended for
      COVID-19 and also to define the risk of secondary disease transmission to other household
      members of HCWs.

    <textblock>
      Risk of transmission of COVID-19 virus to healthcare workers (HCWs) is matter of debate since
      the start of this pandemic. In absence of adequate research, the transmission risk is based
      on non-human studies, non-HCWs epidemiological studies and experiences from previous
      pandemics or epidemics. The true magnitude of the risk to HCWs has not been clearly
      estimated. In absence of good scientific data, general recommendations create confusion and
      mistrust among HCWs. Besides lots of myth and misconceptions among the HCWs including
      physician adds to emotional and physical challenge in reduction of nosocomial transmission of
      COVID-19.

      COVID-19 related lockdowns have disrupted the global supply-chain and good quality personal
      protective equipment (PPE) has become an intense matter of discussion from the start of
      pandemic. The rational use of PPE has become necessity to ensure sustained supply to those
      who need it in the frontline. In absence of reliable risk assessment and management based on
      true incidence calculation leads to either inadequate or overestimation of risk and
      unjustified use of PPE. The reported global data for occupational risk of COVID -19 for HCW
      varies greatly but it is reported to be higher than general populations. However, many of
      these studies has significant limitations, like inadequate risk assessment, community
      transmission is not accounted or all HCWs not included for analysis.

      The investigators propose to conduct a retrospective study to define and quantify the
      variable occupational and non-occupational risk among various HCWs, to determine the rates of
      acquisition in the context of level of PPE use and other infection control measures
      recommended for COVID-19 and also to define the risk of secondary disease transmission to
      other household members of participants.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1.2.1 All staffs that are currently working in included hospitals and clinic in 1.2.1.1
        Laboratory confirmed positive case- A positive case is where COVID-19 virus is detected
        through real time polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) either through oropharyngeal or
        nasopharyngeal swab which were conducted on HCWs based on national guidelines of UAE and
        are based on either symptoms, or as part of contact tracing or history of recent
        international travel.

        1.2.1.2 Laboratory confirmed positive case with history of occupational exposure- through
        contact tracing after an exposure to a known COVID -19 patient in a healthcare setting.

        1.2.1.3 Laboratory confirmed positive case with no history of occupational exposure-
        non-occupational exposures include situations where there was no probable workplace
        exposure for the healthcare worker, and a community source for the infection through
        household contact, travel, gathering in public places or visiting to affected area as most
        likely source of exposure is identified.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Staff who refused to participate or withdraw there consent during the study.
