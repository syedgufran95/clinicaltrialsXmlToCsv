    <textblock>
      Observational, cross-sectional, multi-center, multi-wave survey, assessing characteristics
      and predictors of physical and mental health as well as health behaviors during COVID-19
      pandemic, targeting the general population (children, adolescents and adults).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 (known as Coronavirus)
      virus a global pandemic. COVID-19 is a variant of coronavirus thought to originate in Wuhan
      province China. Up until April 7, 2020, as many as 1,346,299 individuals had confirmed
      COVID-19 infection, with already 74,679 deaths from COVID-19 complications.

      The hypothesis of this study is that the physical and mental health of the general population
      and health care workers involved in the management of COVID-19 infected people is heavily
      affected by COVID-19, but that risk and protective factors exist.

      Investigators plan to distribute 3 different surveys based on the age group. The first
      survey, COH-FIT-Adults/ (COH-FIT-A), will be distributed the general adult (age &gt;/= 18 years
      old) population in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia via an
      online link, making the general population aware of the project via public announcements,
      social media and regular media coverage outlets, or via specialized institutes and agencies
      (e.g., opinion research centers) that are capable of using a randomly selected, nationally
      representative sample (potentially funded by national / local grant applications). For the
      subgroup of adult health-care professionals, additionally, survey distribution mechanisms
      will be used that utilize medical professional organizations and associations, hospital and
      university anonymized channels.

      Guardians of adolescents aged 14-17 years old will be asked to provide electronic consent for
      their adolescent to participate in the COH-FIT-AD survey after having taken the survey and
      being familiar with the questions, being informed that the one question having sexuality as
      the content will be omitted from the adolescent version. Guardians of children aged 6-13
      years old will be able to review the survey questions that children would answer before
      electronically consenting to participate.
