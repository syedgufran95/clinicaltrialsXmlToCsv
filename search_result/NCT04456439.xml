  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This intermediate-size expanded access protocol plans to treat approximately 50 children or
      adolescents, male and female, with MIS-C associated with COVID-19. Participants who are 2
      months to 17 years of age, inclusive, will be enrolled at multiple clinical sites across the
      United States.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. 2 months to 17 years of age, inclusive

          2. Positive for current or recent SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection by real-time reverse
             transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), serology, or antigen test; or
             COVID-19 exposure within the 4 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms AND no alternative
             plausible diagnoses

          3. Presenting with:

               -  Fever (&gt;38.0°C or &gt;100.4°F for ≥24 hours) or reporting subjective fever lasting
                  ≥24 hours

               -  Laboratory evidence of inflammation with high sensitivity C-reactive protein
                  (hsCRP) ≥4.0 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) and associated abnormalities of at
                  least one of the following:

                    -  elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)

                    -  elevated fibrinogen

                    -  elevated procalcitonin

                    -  elevated d-dimer

                    -  elevated ferritin

                    -  elevated lactic dehydrogenase (LDH)

                    -  elevated interleukin 6 (IL-6)

                    -  elevated neutrophils

                    -  reduced lymphocytes

                    -  low albumin

               -  Evidence of clinically severe multisystem illness requiring hospitalization.
                  Participants must have demonstrable cardiac involvement (reduced left ventricular
                  [LV] ejection fraction ≤50%) and at least one other organ involvement (renal,
                  respiratory, hematologic, gastrointestinal, dermatologic or neurological)

          4. If on mechanical ventilation or ECMO, ≤72 hours post initiation of the respiratory
             support device

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Documented other microbial cause for MIS-C including bacterial sepsis, staphylococcal
             or streptococcal shock syndromes, or infections associated with myocarditis such as
             enterovirus. Of importance, waiting for results of these investigations should not
             delay initiation of remestemcel-L therapy.

          2. Females who are pregnant or lactating

          3. Known hypersensitivity to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or to porcine or bovine proteins

          4. Aspartate aminotransferase/alanine transaminase (AST/ALT) ≥5x upper limit of normal
             (ULN)

          5. Creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min

          6. Serum creatinine &gt;2 mg/dL

          7. Any end-stage organ disease which in the opinion of the treating physician may
             possibly affect the safety of the remestemcel-L treatment.
