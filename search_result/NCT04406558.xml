  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The lockdown of the French population is a health measure put in place in response to the
      pandemic linked to a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19). After a health campaign to
      recommend hygienic &quot;barrier gestures&quot; and social distancing, the decision to confine the
      population at the national level was decided by the executive from Monday 16 March to Monday
      11 May 2020. The national confinement implies the restriction of movement to the strict
      necessary, outings near the home and the closure of schools and communities. These decisions
      have led to an unprecedented state of stress for the entire French population, the
      consequences of which are unknown in the short, medium or long term. The objectives of this
      study are to evaluate the psychological impact of the confinement on adolescents with or
      without chronic disease and also the difficulties and fears engendered by deconfinement .
