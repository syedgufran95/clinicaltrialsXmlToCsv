  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is the pandemic disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. It is a highly
      contagious viral disease, the condition of which main clinical symptoms are characterized by
      fever and respiratory symptoms. Evidence indicates to worse outcomes in patients with
      pre-existing diseases, such as diabetes, arterial hypertension, heart disease, pneumopathies,
      chronic kidney disease, and immunodeficiencies. Recipients of kidney transplants make
      prolonged use of immunosuppressive drugs to inhibit the acquired immune response, notably the
      activity of lymphocytes. Due to this potential to modulate the immune and inflammatory
      response, it is speculated that the clinical and laboratory condition of COVID-19 in these
      patients is atypical. Preliminary evidence suggests worse outcomes of COVID-19 in
      immunosuppressed patients, as carriers of cancer. However, information on kidney transplant
      recipients is insufficient. So far, only reports of the case are available in the literature
      with different clinical presentations and outcomes. The aim of this study is, therefore, to
      characterize the demographics, clinical and laboratory conditions, and the outcomes of
      COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients in a national multicenter cohort.

      COVID-19 is the pandemic disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. It is a highly

      characterize the demographics, clinical and laboratory conditions (mechanical ventilation,
      need for dialysis, need for ICU admission during evolution) and the outcomes of COVID-19
      (death and graft loss within 3 months after infection up to 3 months after resolution) in
      kidney transplant recipients in a national multicenter cohort.Inclusion Criteria:1. Kidney
      transplant recipients, which may be multi-organ recipients, transplanted in any follow-up
      period; 2. Positive diagnostic test for COVID-19 (detection of viral load, test for detection
      of antigens or tests for detection of antibodies); 3.Outpatient or hospital management;
      4.Adults and children. Exclusion Criteria: None
