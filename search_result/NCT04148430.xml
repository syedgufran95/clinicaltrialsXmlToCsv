    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Arm 1 (CART Cell Group):

          -  Patients (age &gt;/= 18) with a diagnosis of relapsed CD19+ B-cell ALL or NHL receiving
             commercially approved CD19-specific CAR T cells (e.g. tisagenleuleucel and
             axicabtagene) are eligible for the study

        Arm 2 (COVID-19 Group):

        Both Cohorts:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years old, with underlying solid tumor or hematologic malignancies

          -  A positive test for SARS-CoV2 virus in any specimen, or recent exposure to a known
             COVID-19 positive contact, or belonging to a high risk demographic group (living
             and/or working in high-risk setting)

        Cohort 1:

          -  Infilgrate on CXR or CT scan, AND

          -  O2 saturation ≤ 93% on room air, or requiring supplemental oxygen, or respiratory rate
             ≥ 30 breaths/min

          -  Evidence of systemic inflammatory response as defined by presence of at least two of
             the following:

               -  Fever of ≥ 38C at any time point following suspected diagnosis, or

               -  CRP &gt; 5 mg/dL, or

               -  Ferritin &gt; 500 ng/mL

               -  AST/ALT ≤ 5x ULN

          -  Patients with uncontrolled systemic fungal and bacterial infections

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived proteins

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             (women who have undergone surgical sterilization or who have been postmenopausal for
             at least 2 years are not considered to be of childbearing potential)

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding

        Arm 2 (COVID-19 Group) only:

          -  Concurrent JAK inhibitors and/or IL-6 inhibitors (tocilizumab, siltuximab, etc.) for
             treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia are excluded but previous history or administration of
             these agents are allowed and no washout time is needed.

          -  History of or concurrent use of hydroxychloroquine, anti-viral drugs, antibiotics,
             corticosteroids and convalescent plasma is allowed.

          -  Patients receiving active chemotherapy or patients whose life expectancy is estimated
             to be &lt;3 months in the opinion of investigators, strictly due to their cancer
             diagnosis (i.e. not due to COVID-19) are excluded

          -  Myelosuppressive chemotherapy is prohibited until clinical recovery (i.e. 1 or 2 on
             the 7-category ordinal scale)

          -  CrCl &lt;30 mL/minute

          -  Treatment with any investigational agent is prohibited, except for investigational
             SAR-Co-V2 anti-viral agents, through 28 days after the last dose of anakinra
