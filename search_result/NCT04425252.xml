    <textblock>
      This will be a phase 1a randomized, open label, multi-center study with approximately 24
      subjects. All subjects will receive standard of care (SOC) per institutional guidelines for
      treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection. In addition to SOC, the brequinar
      group will receive 5 daily doses of brequinar 100 mg.

      This will be a phase 1a randomized, open label, multi-center study with approximately 24
      subjects. All subjects will receive standard of care (SOC) per institutional guidelines for
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:2 ratio to standard of care
      alone or standard of care plus brequinar. The brequinar group will receive 5 daily doses of
      brequinar 100 mg on Days 1 - 5. Physical examinations, vital signs, laboratory assessments,
      SARS-CoV-2 testing, and other observations will be conducted by experienced personnel
      throughout the study based on the Schedule of Events. Blood chemistry tests include blood
      urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine amino transferase (ALT),
      aspartate amino transferase (AST), bilirubin, total protein, albumin, glucose, serum
      electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide/bicarbonate, and calcium), lactate
      dehydrogenase (LDH). Plasma will be collected for inflammatory markers such as D-dimer,
      ferritin, CRP, and ESR. Pro-inflammatory markers will be measured. Serum is to be collected
      for research purposes. Hematology tests include hemoglobin, hematocrit, complete blood count
      with full differential, and platelet count. Nasopharyngeal swabs for viral load will be
      collected Days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 15. Survival will be assessed through Day 29.

             additional risk to the patient.

          2. Active malignancy other than squamous cell carcinoma; anticancer treatment such as
             chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the past month.

             procedure).

         15. Life expectancy of &lt; 5 days in the judgment of the treating clinician.

             ECMO, or clinical diagnosis of respiratory failure (i.e., clinical need for one of the
             preceding therapies, but preceding therapies may not be able to be administered in
             setting of resource limitation) ii. Shock (defined by systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mm
             Hg, or diastolic blood pressure &lt; 60 mm Hg or requiring vasopressors) b. Multi-organ
