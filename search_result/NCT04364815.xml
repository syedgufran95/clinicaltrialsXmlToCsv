  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This COVID-19 pandemic warrants urgent strategies to protect people at high risk of
      infection, particularly the healthcare workers. Secondary prevention through post-exposure
      prophylaxis (PEP) and early treatment of infection are needed to prevent severe cases and cut
      secondary transmission. Hydroxycholoroquine (HCQ) is an inexpensive anti-malarial drug with
      immunomodulatory effects that are currently used as an off-label treatment for symptomatic
      COVID-19 patients. In vitro studies have shown that it can efficiently inhibit SARS-CoV-2
      infection and has potential as a post-exposure prophylaxis drug.

      To compare the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine with an oral loading dose of 400 mg
      two times a day on D1 followed by 400mg/day from Day 2-10 plus standard preventive measures
      and standard preventive measures alone as post-exposure prophylaxis for healthcare workers in
      a Metro Manila COVID Referral Center

Computer-generated random numbers for two groups will be used by a third party to create an allocation list for participants
The pharmacist will prepare the test medication in sequentially numbered packages
The third party will be contacted upon enrollment of a participant for the assigned group
Blinding
Placebo tablets will have the same appearance as the HCQ tablets
The pharmacist will prepare the test medications in sequentially numbered packages
Blinding of the outcome assessor will be achieved by using numerical codes on the Case Record Form of each patient with no indication of the group assignment on the Case Record Forms
Laboratory specimens, ECG strip, and RT-PCR test specimens will be labeled with the numerical code of the participant and test number</masking_description>
