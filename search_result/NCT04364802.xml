    <textblock>
      Povidone-iodine (PVP-I) is a broad-spectrum antiseptic with activity against bacteria, fungi,
      and viruses. It has been previously used in both intranasal preparations against Methicillin
      Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) as well as oral preparations in in-vitro studies of
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome
      Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), influenza H1N1, and rotavirus with good efficacy. This study will
      evaluate the efficacy of PVP-I as prophylaxis in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19)-negative
      front-line health care workers and hospital patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus - 2
      (SARS-CoV-2), has been implicated in over 900,000 cases in the United States alone and has
      been found to affect as many as 28% of healthcare workers (HCW) worldwide. The most current
      statistics from Iceland, China, and Italy indicate that up to 50% of infected patients may be
      asymptomatic or with negligible symptomatology. This, added to the national shortage of
      personal protective equipment (PPE) and the need to reuse PPE, lends to the significantly
      increased risk to healthcare providers.

      The highest concentration of viral particles resides within the nasopharynx. The virus is
      thought to spread via respiratory droplets with the potential for transmission via inhalation
      of droplets, contact to the nose and mouth with infected materials, and airborne
      transmission. Given that frontline workers are involved in high-risk procedures including
      intubation, bronchoscopy, proning patients (which can lead to droplet production) and in some
      cases are reusing PPE, finding ways to reduce viral load or viral exposure are paramount.

      Povidone-iodine (PVP-I) is a broad-spectrum antiseptic with activity against bacteria, fungi,
      and viruses. It has been previously used in both intranasal preparations against MRSA as well
      as oral preparations in in-vitro studies of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, H1N1, and rotavirus with good
      efficacy.

      Due to the known breadth of its antiviral activity and similarities in molecular structure,
      it can be extrapolated that PVP-I should have robust activity against SARS-CoV-2. Eggers et
      al found that at a concentration of 1% there was a reduction of viral activity of 99.99% in
      in-vitro assays. At 2 minutes, a concentration of 0.23% was enough to reduce viral loads
      appreciably.

      PVP-I is widely used as an antiseptic and is well-tolerated and has been shown to have little
      to no effect on mucociliary clearance, olfaction, or thyroid function if iodine holidays are
      taken.

      In this study, front line healthcare workers will be asked to complete a pre-participation
      survey and screened for COVID positivity. They will then be given premade PVP-I gargles and
      nasal sprays, as well as a calendar card to mark compliance. PVP-I nasal spray and gargle
      (10% diluted 1:30) will be used prior to the start of a shift, during &quot;lunch break&quot;, and at
      the end of shift. First, the nasal spray will be sprayed in the nose (2 sprays each naris).
      For adequate coverage, the participant should be able to taste the iodine or see it in the
      back of the throat. This should be left in place for 30 seconds. Then, the participant will
      gargle the solution for 30 seconds and not have anything to eat or drink by mouth for 30
      minutes. Treatment will continue for 3 weeks, or until the healthcare worker presents with
      COVID symptoms. Participants will then be tested for COVID positivity and asked to fill out a
      second questionnaire assessing study tolerability. At completion of the study, they will be
      asked to turn in their calendar card to assess how many applications they were able to
      complete.

      Given the high rate of asymptomatic carriers, a second arm will also be planned for patients
      who have a 7+ day hospitalization or who are set to undergo a significant surgical procedure.
      These patients will be offered participation in the study as well and will be given the same
      questionnaire and undergo preoperative testing if they consent. For patients in the study
      group, PVIP gargle and nasal sprays will be applied preoperatively or shortly after admission
      and enrollment in the study for the non-operative group. The patients will then be retested
      in 2 weeks or as directed by the presentation of symptoms concerning for infection with
      SARS-CoV-2.
