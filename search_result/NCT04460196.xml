  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthcare renunciation is defined as: &quot;Individuals give up care when they do not seek
      services and health care professionals when they experience a disorder, experience a physical
      or mental disorder, or when they do not access all of the prescribed care.&quot; In 2008, 16.5% of
      the general French population reported having renounced care. The causes mentioned of the
      renunciation are mainly the financial difficulties, the deadlines of appointments considered
      too long, the geographical remoteness. In the department of Sarthe, the rate of cessation of
      care is estimated at 27.6% over the period from 2014 to 2017.

      In the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, containment was applied in France counted from 17
      March 2020. The widespread message was &quot;save lives, stay at home&quot;. The Ministry of Solidarity
      and Health has provided health professionals with a circular to adapt the management of
      patients with chronic disease, requiring elective surgical care and pregnant women.

      The decline in activity of general practitioners is estimated at 44% and that of other
      specialists at 71%. In Paris, visits to the emergency room fell by 45% for adults and 70% for
      children.

      The main risk is the deterioration of the health status of some patients with the worsening
      of chronic diseases, the discovery of pathologies during episodes of decompensation and the
      absence of management of serious acute pathologies.

      The study aims to assess the importance of giving up care during this period of COVID-19 and
      in comparison with a study conducted at the University Hospital of Angers and the hospital of
      Le Mans in 2017.
