    <textblock>
      The International Registry of Coronavirus Exposure in Pregnancy (IRCEP) is a prospective
      cohort study of pregnant and recently pregnant women who have been tested for SARS-CoV-2
      (regardless of the result) or have been clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 by a health care
      professional. Data from the IRCEP will be used to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on
      pregnancy and birth outcomes.

      The International Registry of Coronavirus Exposure in Pregnancy (IRCEP) will enroll women 18
      years of age and older who are currently pregnant or have been pregnant women within the last
      6 months, and who have been tested for SARS-CoV-2 (regardless of the result) or have been
      clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 by a health care professional. As this is an international
      registry, women from all countries are welcome to participate.

      Women will enroll and provide information to the IRCEP via website and mobile app. After
      signing the electronic informed consent document, registrants will answer questions on the
      following modules: Demographics, Reproductive History, Height and Weight, Habits, Health
      Conditions, Medications, Current Pregnancy, COVID-19 Infection Test, and COVID-19 Infection
      Symptoms. Monthly follow-up modules will continue until the pregnancy outcome. In case of a
      live birth, the Registry participant will continue with the Post-Partum Outcomes module until
      the newborn is 90 days of age. Medical records from the mother and neonate will also be
      requested.
