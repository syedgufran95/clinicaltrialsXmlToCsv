  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prone position (PP) has been proved to be effective in severe ARDS patients. On the other
      hand, High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) may prevent intubation in hypoxemic Acute respiratory
      failure (ARF) patients.

      Our hypothesis is that the combination of PP and HFNC in patients with COVID19 induced ARDS
      may decrease the need of mechanical ventilation.

      Primary outcome: Therapeutic failure within 28 days of randomization (death or intubation).
      Secondary outcomes: to analyze PP feasibility and safety in HFNC patients and to analyze
      effectiveness in terms of oxygenation.

      Methods: multicentric randomized study including patients with COVID19 induced ARDS supported
      with HFNC. Experimental group will received HFNC and PP whereas observation group will
      received standard care.

      Optimization of non-invasive respiratory management of COVID19 induced ARDS patients may
      decrease the need of invasive mechanical ventilation and subsequently ICU and hospital length
      of stay.

    <ipd_description>Data will be shared to perform a meta-trial including other studies that assess the effectiveness of prone position in COVID-19 patients supported with nasal high flow.
No patient identifying data will be transferred to the data repository. The data set will use pseudoanonymised data. The consent process for the study will highlight that this is a meta-trial and that both aggregated and individual data without personal identifying features will be used to formulate the results from the study. Local regulation for the management of patient data needs to be adhered to as part of agreement for involvement in the study.
Data will be shared during the study at two points, Time 1 An interim analysis at 200 patients in which aggregated outcome data for the primary outcome and severe adverse effects will be analyzed
Time 2 Final analysis outlining salient clinical feature of patients for each group, outcomes</ipd_description>
