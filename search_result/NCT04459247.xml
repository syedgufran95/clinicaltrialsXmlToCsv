  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated
      coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected the lives of millions of individuals globally and
      severely strained the medical community. Pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive
      individuals far outnumber the symptomatic ones or those with severe disease. The transmission
      potential of SARS CoV-2 is potentially greator than earlier viral outbreaks of SARS-CoV and
      MERS-CoV. Identification of asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 infection is paramount to
      contain viral infection because of high transmission potential Routine measures of social
      distancing, personal hand hygiene and limited outdoor contact activities have shown benefits
      to limit corona virus infection. However, the role of vitamin D in SARS-CoV-2 infection is
      not explored despite the knowledge of an immunomodulatory role and protective effect of
      vitamin D against viral infections. It has been found that mortality from COVID-19 is more in
      countries with vitamin D deficiency.

      The role of therapeutic vitamin D supplementation in asymptomatic individuals with vitamin-D
      deficiency and COVID-19 is not known. Immune-modulatory effect of vitamin D is likely to be
      observed at 25(OH)D levels which are considered higher than that required for normal bone
      metabolism.An earlier SARS-CoV-2 negativity may have significant public health benefits in
      limiting the spread of the disease. Therefore, we hypothesise that high dose vitamin D
      supplementation in patients with COVID-19 and vitamin D deficiency may lead to SARS-CoV-2
      negativity in greater proportions of patients associated with decrease in serological markers
      of inflammation.

      The role of therapeutic vitamin D supplementation in asymptomatic individuals with vitamin-D
      deficiency and COVID-19 is not known. Immune-modulatory effect of vitamin D is likely to be
      observed at 25(OH)D levels which are considered higher than that required for normal bone
      metabolism.[6] An earlier SARS-CoV-2 negativity may have significant public health benefits
      in limiting the spread of the disease. Therefore, we hypothesise that high dose vitamin D
      supplementation in patients with COVID-19 and vitamin D deficiency may lead to SARS-CoV-2
      negativity in greater proportions of patients associated with decrease in serological markers
      of inflammation.

      Methods: Consecutive individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were mildly symptomatic or
      asymptomatic with or without co-morbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic
      obstructive airway disease, chronic liver disease) admitted to tertiary care hospital in
      north India were invited for the study. A written consent was obtained from all patients
      included in the study and protocol was approved by the Institute Ethics Committee.

      Patients with vitamin D deficiency defined as 25 (OH)D level&lt;20 ng/ml were randomized to
      receive daily 60,000IU of cholecalciferol (5 ml oral solution in nano droplet form) for seven
      days in the &quot;intervention arm&quot; or to receive a single dose of 60,000 IU vitamin D
      supplementation at admission in the &quot;control arm&quot;. Patients unable to take oral
      supplementation like those requiring invasive ventilation were excluded. Subsequently,
      25(OH)D levels were assessed at day 7 and a weekly supplementation of 60,000IU provided to
      those with 25(OH)D &gt;50 ng/ml or continued on daily vitamin D 60,000 IU supplementation for
      another seven days in participants with 25 (OH)D&lt;50ng/ml (day-14) in the intervention arm. No
      vitamin D supplementation was provided in the control arm other than the initial dose at
      hospital admission.

      25 (OH)D, serum calcium, phosphorus, fibrinogen , d-dimer, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin,
      renal and liver function tests were performed periodically up till day-21 or virus
      negativity, whichever occurred earlier. Oro-pharyngeal swabs were obtained for SARS-CoV-2 RNA
      detection at day-5, 7, 10, 14, 18 and 21 and detection was performed by real-time polymerase
      chain reaction (RT-PCR), CFX-96 IVD, Bio-Rad. 25 (OH)D was analysed by
      electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) (Roche Cobas E 801 Analyzer; Roche Diagnostics),
      using the kit supplied by the same manufacturer (Elecsys Total Vitamin D, version 2.0). Serum
      calcium (N, 8.5-10.2 mg/dl) and C-reactive protein (N, 0-5 mg/l) were processed by ECLIA
      method using Roche Cobas 8000, Roche Diagnostics. D dimer (N, 0-240 ng/ml) &amp; fibrinogen (N,
      2-4g/l) were analyzed using Stago Compact/ Stago STA R model, Diagnostica Stago, Inc, USA
      respectively.
