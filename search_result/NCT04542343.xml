  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      African American adults, specifically those managing chronic disease and social isolation,
      are one of the most vulnerable groups susceptible to COVID-19. This intervention involves a
      multi-disciplinary and culturally sensitive approach to address two major COVID-19 related
      challenges in this population. First, this program collaborates with predominantly African
      American churches to implement Federal and State guidelines aimed at preventing outbreaks of
      COVID-19 at faith-based gatherings. Second, this program trains church-based health advisors
      to help African American older parishioners manage their chronic health conditions and reduce
      psychological distress during the pandemic.

      To jointly implement and evaluate a telehealth-based, multidisciplinary, culturally-sensitive
      intervention with 265 AA older parishioners: (i) To mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19
      on the management of chronic health conditions, and (ii) to reduce healthcare avoidance
      behaviors and psychological distress.
