  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect data on physical activity, food consumption, stress, sleep, and
      alcohol consumption habits both before and after the national emergency for COVID-19 was put
      into place. This will help identify the health behavior changes taking place due to the
      COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Data on past and current health behaviors will be
      self-reported by participants via a single online survey. The retrospective health behavior
      questions will be the same quantitative questions as the current health behavior questions so
      a direct comparison can be made. There will be a couple qualitative questions to assess what
      each participant feels are the greatest barriers or impacts to their current health
      behaviors. Participants will be recruited via convenient sampling.

      Data collected in this study will show a decline in at least one healthy behavior after the
      United States national emergency for COVID-19.

    <time_frame>1-3 months</time_frame>
    <description>A negative shift in health behaviors when comparing individual health behavior before COVID-19 and the last 7-30 days. This behavior change may be in one or multiple health behaviors measured. A negative shift is indicated by overall decrease in physical activity time or intensity, increase in sitting time, increase in alcohol consumption days or drinks on drinking occasions, a decrease in fruit/vegetable consumption, or indication of consuming more food.</description>
