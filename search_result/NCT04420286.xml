    <textblock>
      For preventing the overwhelming of ICU beds capacity during COVID-19 pandemic in France,
      national and regional Health-Care institutions decided to optimize the Intensive Care Unit
      beds availability by opening new ICU beds in institutions with and without prior ICU. The
      Present study was design to retrospectively describe the origin of the ICU beds and human
      resources created during the COVID-19 outbreak in France.

      Since December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease has caused a worldwide outbreak of
      respiratory illness that rapidly invaded leading the world (WHO). Its most severe form is
      dominated by an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with other organ failures
      requiring mechanical ventilation and admission in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). With a wide
      pandemic effect and a long length of mechanical ventilation, the intensive care units were
      quickly full.

      For preventing the overwhelming of ICU beds capacity, national and regional Health-Care
      institutions (then French Health minister, every Regional Health) decided to optimize the
      Intensive Care Unit beds availability by opening new ICU beds in institutions with and
      without prior ICU.

      Daily ICU beds availability was assessed in each institution, and at the regional level to
      organize potential patient transfers across regional and national hospital. Moreover, an
      extraordinary mobilization and joint efforts of medical, paramedical and administrative staff
      allowed getting the caregivers for managing the most severe patients in each ICU. All
      physicians who could manage ICU patients were involved in this crisis. In this context,
      anesthesiologists (who have gotten an ICU education during their studies) were involved, as
      the surgical activity has been reduced to the vital procedures. This overall organization
      permitted the admission of more patients than the initial maximum national capacity of ICU
      beds.
