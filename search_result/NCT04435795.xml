    <textblock>
      The CONTAIN (CiclesOnide cliNical TriAl covId-19 treatmeNt) is a randomized control study of
      ciclesonide vs placebo for mild covid-19 disease. The need for potential therapy for COVID-19
      patients is urgent. Ciclesonide has shown encouraging in vitro results, is easy to be used
      and is readily available. It has a low rate of side effects and few interactions with other
      drugs. It is unusual to use an inhaled steroid drug for COVID-19 but there has been new data
      suggesting steroids may have an antiviral effect in addition to an anti-inflammatory effect.
      We propose to use inhaled and nasal ciclesonide to stop viral replication in the nose and
      airways. We hope this will accelerate recovery from COVID-19 illness in individuals who are
      not admitted to hospital at time of diagnosis of COVID-19.
