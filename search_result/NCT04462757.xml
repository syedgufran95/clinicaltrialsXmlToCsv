  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current COVID-19 pandemic is a worldwide healthcare crisis. Of concern is the large
      number of patients that are/will require mechanical ventilation, and the associated strain
      that this will place on healthcare resources. At present, there are no specific therapeutic
      interventions directed at COVID-19 infection. However, observational data suggest that there
      is a subgroup of patients that demonstrate a hyperinflammatory response in response to
      COVID-19 and have a higher requirement for Critical Care and higher mortality.

      There is a strong case for the use of the naturally occurring anti-inflammatory cytokine
      interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) in these patients. Anakinra is a recombinant form
      of IL-1Ra that is licensed for clinical use. Success of use of anakinra in COVID-19 trials
      will be greatly enhanced by robust scientific evidence and established pharmacokinetics which
      inform the most effective dosing regimens. The latter is especially important when, as in the
      case of anakinra, drug supplies are limited, the drug has short half-life and clinical ease
      of application is critical.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan a small trial of an existing drug in patients with COVID-19 at Salford
      Royal NHS Foundation Trust (SRFT) and Manchester Foundation Trust (MFT). The investigators
      will recruit patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection within 24 hours of being
      transfer in a Critical Care department. The investigators have been testing interleukin-1
      receptor antagonist: IL-1Ra (known as Anakinra) for many years. Marketed as a treatment for
      rheumatoid arthritis and for some rare autoimmune diseases, we have shown Anakinra also
      reduces or blocks inflammation in a number of other conditions e.g. stroke and brain
      haemorrhage. The investigators have found it to be safe, easily administered and well
      tolerated. As part of the global response to the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, researchers have
      identified drugs that repurposing existing drugs. Anakinra has been proposed as a candidate
      therapy for COVID-19 and will be used in REMAP-CAP clinical trial as an intravenous (IV)
      therapy four times daily (qds). Whilst there is uncertainty about the therapeutic benefits,
      the investigators wish to explore the theory that they can achieve comparable concentrations
      in the blood using a subcutaneous (SC) injection twice daily (bd), as observed with IV
      therapy qds. We will randomise up to 40 patients to receive either SC Anakinra twice daily or
      IV Anakinra four-times daily for 14 days (or until discharge from CCU). They will measure
      changes in biomarkers in both groups and use the data to inform a mathematical model to
      simulate the effect the drug may have on the body. The aim is to the provide evidence that a
      lower dose SC Anakinra is as effective as higher dose IV.
