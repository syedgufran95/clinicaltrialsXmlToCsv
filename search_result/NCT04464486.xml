    <textblock>
      This project will evaluate the benefit of an automated home symptom monitoring system,
      Symptom Care at Home, to track COVID-19 symptoms, provide instructions to reduce COVID-19
      exposure, and reduce cancer symptom severity during the COVID-19 pandemic. The investigators
      will determine if Symptom Care at Home decreases the need for cancer patients to use
      emergency departments and hospitalization for cancer symptom care. The project addresses the
      urgent public health need for cancer patients to reduce their risk for COVID-19 exposure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an opportunity to rapidly flex platforms for
      remote cancer symptom tracking and management to incorporate COVID-19 symptom monitoring and
      reinforce risk-reducing precautions. It is critical for cancer patients at home to monitor
      early indications of COVID-19 symptoms, to adhere to mitigation strategies, as well as to
      manage their cancer-related symptoms so that patients can decrease the need to utilize the
      emergency department or unplanned hospitalizations for symptom care, which is a common
      occurrence during cancer care. Remote monitoring adds a layer of home-based support which can
      benefit all cancer patients and is not restricted to geographic proximity to oncology
      providers or distance from a cancer center. The Symptom Care at Home (SCH) system, utilized
      for the Principal Investigator's currently funded R01CA206522 project to monitor and manage
      patient-reported (PRO) cancer symptoms, includes these necessary elements: remote PRO symptom
      monitoring, patient self-management information, and oncology provider (nurse practitioner)
      notification of symptoms exceeding pre-set thresholds. The overall purpose of this project is
      to describe the impacts of COVID-19 on cancer patients' well-being at home and evaluate,
      through a randomized clinical trial, if a systematic patient-reported outcomes (PRO)
      reporting process improves cancer care during a pandemic as compared to usual care. Specific
      Aims include: 1) describe patient-reported COVID-19 and cancer symptom trajectories over
      time, COVID-19 social distancing and hygiene practices, and COVID-19 related cancer treatment
      and daily living impacts on cancer patients receiving the SCH-COVID intervention and 2)
      compare the SCH-COVID intervention to enhanced usual care on health care utilization,
      COVID-19 diagnosis and outcomes, cancer treatment delays or changes, and patient-reported
      global health, anxiety, mood, and feelings of social isolation.

    <description>Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System- Short Form v2.0 Social Isolation- 6a. The PROMIS Social Isolation item bank assesses perceptions of being avoided, excluded, detached, disconnected from, or unknown by, others. The item bank does not use a time frame (e.g. over the past seven days) when assessing social isolation. A higher PROMIS T-score represents more of the concept being measured. For negatively-worded concepts like Social Isolation, a T-score of 60 is one SD worse than average. By comparison, a Social Isolation Tscore of 40 is one SD better than average.</description>

    <description>The SCH intervention group will report COVID-19 and cancer-related symptom presence and severity daily into the automated SCH system. Participants receive automated self-management support messages for symptoms reported and a Nurse Practitioner monitors and responds to alerts for COVID-19 symptoms and poorly controlled or worsening cancer symptoms. Participants in this group complete baseline and monthly measures.</description>

    <description>In addition to receiving usual care from their oncologist and staff, the SCH intervention group will report COVID-19 and cancer-related symptom presence and severity daily into the automated SCH system. Participants in the intervention receive automated self-management support messages for symptoms reported. In addition, COVID-19 symptoms and poorly controlled or worsening cancer symptoms will generate alerts. Based on preset thresholds, alerts automatically generate immediately from the patient's daily call data. The study nurse practitioners (NPs) monitor alerts. The NPs provide follow-up care using the guideline based SCH symptom clinical decision support system. The NPs log into the SCH Alert and Call Data website which displays all of the patients who have called that day and met an alert threshold. The NP calls the patient, delivers symptom management care by phone, and documents care in the patients' electronic health records.</description>
