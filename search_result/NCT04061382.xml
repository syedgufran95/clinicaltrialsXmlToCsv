  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to assess the feasibility of establishing a national
      sero-epidemiological survey in England in individuals aged 0-24 years, focusing on assessing
      humoral immunity against diphtheria, Group C invasive meningococcus and SARS-CoV-2. The
      investigators will recruit 2800 to 3500 individuals, divided into two groups:

      Group one (N= 2300):

      This will include all age groups (0-24years), with recruitment restricted by postcodes
      provided by Public Health England (PHE) to recruit a representative population for the region
      as assessed by the IMD (Index of Multiple Deprivation scores).

      Group two (N= up to 1200):

      This group has been added following additional funding to enhance the sample size in response
      to the COVID-19 pandemic. This will recruit 0-19 year olds and will not be restricted by post
      code sampling. Instead recruitment will be by public promotion within the normal recruiting
      regions for each site.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Public Health England has an ongoing sero-prevalence programme to assess how well the
      population is protected from vaccine preventable diseases. The current way to check this is
      by testing left over blood samples from participating healthcare laboratories around the
      country. However, these samples may not be representative of the general population,
      particularly in younger age groups who are often most at risk from vaccine preventable
      diseases. In the Netherlands, they use a different system to assess how well the population
      is protected from vaccine preventable diseases, actively collecting blood samples from a
      representative cross section of society. This type of approach would address the limitations
      of using residual serum samples and allows the collection of additional relevant history e.g.
      number of family members and previous vaccines received. The investigators are therefore
      proposing a pilot study to assess the feasibility of establishing a national sero-
      epidemiological survey in England in individuals aged 0 - 24 years. The investigators will be
      focusing initially on diphtheria and group C invasive meningococcal disease, both of which
      are vaccine preventable. This will involve enrolling 2300 participants in the study from
      different geographical and socioeconomic backgrounds across our test sites and taking a blood
      sample. This blood will be analysed to look at the level of immunity to vaccine preventable
      diseases.

      The original protocol has been amended to include the testing of antibodies against other
      infectious diseases, specifically COVID-19. A second group has been added to recruit an
      additional 500 to 1200 participants between the ages of 0-19 years. The additional funding
      has been used to open two more sites to recruit to group two across regions on England that
      are currently not represented by this study. Having a large number of blood samples from a
      range of age groups is useful when gathering information about an emerging disease such as
      the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19). These samples can help provide answers regarding
      the true number of infections with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus which causes COVID-19 disease) in
      this population.

      In addition to increasing the sample size and the number of regions in the UK that are being
      sampled, a longitudinal sampling cohort has been introduced. Approximately 20% of
      participants equally distributed over the age bands will be enrolled into the longitudinal
      aspect of the study where repeat blood and saliva samples are taken to look for antibodies
      against SARS-CoV-2. A questionnaire to ascertain whether the participant or any household
      contacts have had any symptoms of or been tested positive for COVID-19 will also be
      collected.

      A proportion of participants from this group from selected sites will also provide up to a
      maximum of three blood samples for separation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
      to evaluate T cell responses. These participants can be either seronegative or seropositive
      at their Visit 1.

    <description>Group 1 will be focusing on COVID-19, diphtheria and group C invasive meningococcal disease. The investigators are aiming to recruit around 2300 individuals and the investigators are aiming to ensure that sample is broadly representative of the region according to IMD (Index of Multiple Deprivation scores). PHE have generated a list of all postcodes in recruiting regions and determining the quintiles of IMD within that region. Participants interested in taking part in the study will contact sites to arrange a visits. Basic demographic characteristics will be collected by questionnaire and/ or case report form (CRF) and will include: DOB, gender, GP details, Ethnic group, association with communities of special interest, household income and vaccination history.The questionnaire will gather information regarding potential COVID-19 symptoms both in the participant and the participant's household.</description>

    <description>Group two will focus on 0-19 year olds only. They will not be restricted to the post code sampling. Instead this will include standard recruitment methods such as social media advertisements within the normal recruiting regions for each site. The questionnaire will gather information regarding potential COVID-19 symptoms both in the participant and the participant's household.
A proportion of participants from this group from selected sites will also provide up to a maximum of three blood samples for separation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to evaluate T cell responses. These participants can be either seronegative or seropositive at their Visit 1.</description>

      Blood samples will be centrifuged, separated and frozen at local sites at -80°C. Ideally this
      will happen within 24h with a window of up to 72h. Up to two 2ml aliquots per participant
      will be shipped to PHE in batches of up to 500 on dry ice. Residual sera beyond this volume
      will be shipped to the Oxford Vaccine Group(OVG) for storage. For participants where consent
      is obtained for DNA extraction and storage in the Oxford Vaccine Centre biobank residual
      blood clots will be shipped to the OVG for this purpose. Participant or their parents will
      take the oral fluid swab on the day of the visit. Once received by the study team it will be
      kept in a cool bag until the samples arrive in the lab. They will then be frozen to -80°
      before being shipped to PHE. Blood samples collected for T cell testing will be shipped to
      the OVG lab for same-day processing for separation of PBMCs. Saliva samples with be processed
      in line with local SOPs.
