      In view of increasing cases in India and the possibility of the exponential rise of cases,
      study has been designed to observe the patient profile and outcomes for hospitalized positive
      Covid-19 patients that may help to understand the effectiveness of different treatment
      strategies. This is a retrospective and prospective, observational study based on collection
      of data related to COVID-19 admitted patients treated in the hospitals of Max Healthcare as
      per the standard treatment protocol and policy for COVID 19 at Max Healthcare.

      Covid19 patients shall be approached at the time of admission for participation in this
      study. If the patient consents, the participating investigator or designated study personnel
      will collect the baseline demographic details of the patient, along with medical history;
      current disease status; current and previous treatment details; and the results of all the
      laboratory tests performed, as per the standard clinical practices. Daily follow up will be
      done on a structured case record form (CRF) till the discharge or death.

    <description>Collection of the baseline demographic details of the patient, along with medical history; current disease status; current and previous treatment details; and the results of all the laboratory tests performed, as per the standard clinical practices. All the data will be entered into Excel sheet, row wise for each patient. For studying the demographic profile, the age will be divided into standard 10-year intervals and percentages will be obtained for each sex and combined for males and females. This will be in addition to the mean and SD of age.</description>

    <description>Daily follow up will be done on a structured case record form (CRF) till the discharge or death of the subject. Treatment-Related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v4.0 will be captured in CRF. Clinical profile and outcome will be analyzed separately for each treatment regimen after suitable grouping of the regimens. Statistical significance of the association of outcomes with the clinical profile and treatment regimens will be checked with chi-square test or Fisher exact test in case the numbers are small. Effectiveness of each regimen will also be checked for significance of difference with chi-square test. A P-value &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant but the final conclusion will be based on corroborative evidence and factors such as clinical profile. SPSS 20 will be used for all the calculations.</description>
