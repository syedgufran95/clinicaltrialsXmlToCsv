  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 2019 novel-coronavirus (2019-nCov) is the cause of a cluster of unexplained pneumonia
      that started in Hubei province in China. It has manifest into a global health crisis with
      escalating confirmed cases and spread across many countries.

      In view of the fact that there is currently no effective antiviral therapy, the prevention or
      treatment of diseases caused by COVID-19 can be tough for current treatment.

      This study is a phase I clinical trial. The investigators intent to evaluate the safety,
      reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Recombinant Novel Coronavirus Vaccine (Adenovirus Type 5
      Vector) .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center,open-label，dose-escalating phase I clinical trial in healthy 18 to 60
      years of age, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all eligibility criteria. This
      clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of
      Recombinant Novel Coronavirus Vaccine (Adenovirus Type 5 Vector) manufactured by Beijing
      Institute of Biotechnology and CanSino Biologics Inc.One hundred and eight subjects will be
      enrolled into one of three cohorts and will receive an intramuscular (IM) injection of
      experimental vaccine or placebo on Days 1 in the deltoid muscle.
