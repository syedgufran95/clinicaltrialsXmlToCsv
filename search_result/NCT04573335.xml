  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes management and follow-up has become a challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic.
      Nation-wide lockdowns and social distancing measures adopted in an attempt to break the chain
      of COVID-19 transmission have significantly disrupted routine care and follow-up of diabetes.
      In the health sector, especially in low-income countries such as Pakistan, there has been a
      shift of resources and staff reassignment from stable chronic illnesses to support COVID-19
      pandemic. Disruption of routine outpatient health services and travel restrictions increase
      the risk of worsening diabetes control and diabetes-related health outcomes. Additionally,
      social isolation amidst an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty contributes to stress further
      affecting glycaemic control.

      An observational cross-sectional study was conducted using telephone interview method in
      Diabetes Management Centre (DMC), Services hospital, Lahore. The study participants were 1282
      diabetic patients selected randomly from electronic medical record (EMR) database of the
      Centre. A structured questionnaire was used to evaluate parameters which included patients'

      questions and its impact on quality of life (QoL); financial and social support issues.
