    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered
      coronavirus.

      At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are
      many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments Drugs used to treat malaria
      infection has shown to be beneficial for many other diseases, including viral infections.

      In this Clinical trial, Investigators will evaluate the effect of Artemisinin / Artesunate on
      morbidity of COVID-19 patients in decreasing the course of the disease and viral load in
      symptomatic stable positive swab COVID-19 patients. Investigators are hypothesizing that due
      to the antiviral properties of this drug it will help as a treatment for the COVID -19
      patients. In improving their condition and clearing the virus load,

      In this Clinical trial, Investigators will evaluate the effect of Artemisinin / Artesunate on
      morbidity of COVID-19 patients in decreasing the course of the disease and viral load in
      symptomatic stable positive swab COVID-19 patients. investigators are hypothesizing that due
      to the antiviral properties of this drug it will help as a treatment for the COVID -19
      patients. In improving their condition and clearing the virus load, investigators are testing
      two groups the one that will take the drug and then compare them to a placebo group that will
      not take any drug for the treatment in a blinded fashion made by randomization done by our
      pharmacy team so investigators eliminate risk of bias. Our expectation is to find a total
      reduction of the hospital stay to 7 days instead of 14 days currently indicating the
      effectiveness of the medication in eradicating the virus.
