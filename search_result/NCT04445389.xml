      This clinical study is phase 1/2a clinical trial to evaluate safety, tolerability, and
      immunogenicity of COVID-19 preventive vaccine by intramuscularly administration in healthy
      volunteers.

      Phase 1 of this study is designed as dose escaltion, single arm, open-labeled and a total of
      60 subjects will be enrolled. Phase 2a of study is designed as randomized, double-blind,
      placebo controlled and a total of 150 subjects are planned to be enrolled.
