  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is an emerging pandemic disease affecting most countries including Senegal, caused
      by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) which was first detected in the city of Wuhan in China in
      December 2019. A rapid spread of the disease has occurred at a global scale, associated with
      a mortality rate of 3.4%. The first case in Africa was declared on February 15, 2020 in Egypt
      and the first case in Senegal was declared on March 2nd, 2020.

      In this context, the SEN-CoV-Fadj clinical trial aims to evaluate efficacy and safety, among
      adults, of different therapeutic regimens considered optimal according to current knowledge,
      as well as available and adapted to Sub-Saharan Africa. This trial is nested into a cohort of
      confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Senegal aiming to understand the main clinical, biological,
      virologic and immunological characteristics of the infection. The protocol of the cohort is
      based and adapted from the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection
      Consortium (ISARIC) / World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Characterisation Protocol
      (CCP).

      The Nafamostat mesilate, whose antiviral, anticoagulant an anti-inflammatory activities have
      been shown, has been eligible for SEN-CoV-Fadj for the treatment of moderate to severe
      COVID-19 cases.

      COVID-19 is an emerging pandemic disease affecting most countries including Senegal, caused

      In this context, the SEN-CoV-Fadj clinical trial aims to evaluate efficacy and tolerance,
      among adults, of different therapeutic options considered optimal according to current
      knowledge, as well as available and adapted to Sub-Saharan Africa. This trial is nested into
      a cohort of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Senegal aiming to understand the main clinical,

      Protocol (CCP).

      The Nafamostat mesilate, whose antiviral, anticoagulant an anti-inflammatory activities have
      been shown, has been eligible for SEN-CoV-Fadj for the treatment of moderate to severe
      COVID-19 cases. Its efficacy and safety will be evaluated against the standard of care used
      in Senegal.

      The primary objective is to :

      Evaluate and compare viral clearance between the different therapeutic interventions.

      The secondary objectives are to:

        -  Evaluate and compare efficacy of the different therapeutic regimens

        -  Evaluate and compare the tolerance of the different therapeutic regimens

        -  Evaluate and compare the impact of the different therapeutic interventions on the length
           of hospitalization and other clinical measurements
