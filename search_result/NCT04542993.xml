      Research Question: In ambulatory, non-hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, is it
      possible to utilize resveratrol as a transporter for zinc treatment as means to minimize
      viral load and severity of resulting COVID-19 disease?

      We will enroll 60 ambulatory SARS-CoV-2 positive volunteers who will be randomized into one
      of two treatment arms to receive either Zinc and resveratrol or double placebo for a period
      of 5 days and will be monitored for a 14 day period. We anticipate approximately 20 weeks to
      accrue this cohort resulting in an estimated active project period of 22 weeks, although it
      may take up to 12 additional weeks to collect all of the data related to COVID-19 admissions
      in the cohort.

             within 4 days of enrollment

          2. Ability to read, understand and provide informed consent (no legally authorized
             representatives may consent on their behalf) and study assessments in English

          3. Ability for subject to comply with the requirements of the study (must/will have a
             valid email address, internet connection and phone number)
