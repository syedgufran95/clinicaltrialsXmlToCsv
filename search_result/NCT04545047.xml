  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify early signals of efficacy or harm associated with
      convalescent plasma therapy in a population of Veteran inpatients with coronavirus disease
      2019 (COVID-19).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The convalescent plasma (CP) of individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 may help reduce
      symptoms and mortality when given to ill patients infected with severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Clinical trials are needed to provide definitive
      evidence of the benefits and harms of CP in the treatment of COVID-19. While clinical trials
      are underway, observational research plays a critical role in providing preliminary
      scientific evidence to guide clinical practice.

      This retrospective exposure-control study aims to identify early signals of efficacy and harm
      of CP treatment among Veterans with COVID-19 who received care at a Department of Veterans
      Affairs (VA) hospital. Using VA electronic health record data, the study will examine the
      short- and longer-term impact of CP use and non-use in this population. Severe outcomes will
      be compared between Veterans who received CP and those who did not. Patients will be followed
      from the first day of hospitalization or date of positive SARS-CoV-2 test until the end of
      the observation period, designed to be at least 28 days for short-term analyses and for 1
      year for longer-term analyses. Inverse probability treatment weighting derived from
      propensity scores and other causal inference methods will be employed to emulate
      randomization and thus minimize confounding by indication and other biases.
