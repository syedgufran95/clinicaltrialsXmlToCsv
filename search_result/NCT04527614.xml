    <textblock>
      Background: Each Belgian winter season is characterized by a wave of influenza like and
      respiratory symptoms. Especially, the elderly people are more vulnerable to be infected by
      influenza, but also RSV. The recent COVID-19 pandemic and eventually a next wave, will
      increase the prevalence of influenza like and respiratory symptoms.

      Method: A multicentre non-commercial cohort study will be conducted in nursing home staff and
      residents during the Winter season 2020-2021.

      Objectives: Primary objective is the difference in incidence of influenza like and
      respiratory symptoms between cases (cases have evidence of past infection with SARS-CoV-2,
      referred to as Covid +) and controls (controls have no evidence of previous infection and are
      referred to as Covid -). The primary outcome analysis as well as the secondary outcome
      analyses will use two strata: nursing home staff and nursing home residents. The secondary
      objectives are the difference in incidence of COVID-19, influenza, RSV infections confirmed
      by PCR between cases and controls, to define a correlate of protection in the covid + group
      against re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 based on the study of the pre-existing antibody profile
      (antigen specificity, antibody type and antibody level) at the time of re-exposure. A
      multiplex assay will be used to assess the antibody profile. Finally, to study the COVID-19
      disease severity (7 point WHO ordinal scale, this includes a.o. hospitalisation, mechanical
      ventilation need and ICU admission, mortality) based on the presence/absence of pre-existing
      antibodies and the pre-existing antibody profile. For other respiratory infections we will
      study the need for hospitalization and mortality.

    <description>This study will assess the time to the occurrence of influenza-like illness (ILI) or acute respiratory infection (ARI) in subjects previously COVID+ compared to subjects known as COVID- (controls), more specifically subjects will belong to two subgroups: nursing home residents (65+) and nursing home staff (18-65y).
