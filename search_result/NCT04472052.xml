  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Appendicitis is one of the most common clinical conditions in general surgery. The diagnosis
      is usually made from clinical examination, imaging (sonography or CT) and laboratory
      parameters. The laparoscopic appendectomy without drainage has established as the gold
      standard. Patients usually leave the hospital two days after surgery.

      In times of corona crisis, patients are unsure to visit the hospital because of fear of
      infection with SARS-CoV-2. A higher incidence of perforated appendicitis could be an
      indicator for fear-related delay of going to the hospital.

      Methods: Investigators performed a retrospective analysis on the incidence of perforated
      appendicitis in a 10-week interval (mid-March to end of May) of the years 2018, 2019 and 2020
      to evaluate possible changes in times of corona crisis. Intraoperative findings, procedures,
      complications and the length of hospital stay were considered.

      The local ethics committee of the University Hospital of TÃ¼bingen, Germany, approved this
      study (AZ: 324/2020BO2). All patients treated for acute appendicitis in a ten week period
      from 16th of March to 31th of May in 2018, 2019 and 2020 were considered for the study.
      Investigators analysed the frequency of perforated appendicitis in the periods indicated.
      Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants. Patient's records as well as
      database were analyzed for therapy specific items.

      Definition Perforation: Perforated appendicitis was defined as described perforation in the
      surgical or pathological results.

      Delay between onset of symptoms and first presentation at the hospital: Patient's records
      were proved for self-declaration about the start of symptoms

    <description>Surgical standard treatment for acute appendicitis All patients receive preoperative single-shot antibiosis, usually 2000 mg cefotaxime combined 500 mg metronidazole. Appendectomy is performed usually within 24 h of admission in patients with acute appendicitis. The laparoscopic appendectomy using the 3-trocar technique represents the surgical standard. In uncomplicated or non-perforated appendicitis, drainage is generally not required. Wounds are closed intra-cutaneous with absorbable sutures. Patients without postoperative complications are discharged home two days after surgery.</description>
