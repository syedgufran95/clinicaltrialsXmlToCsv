  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It still unclear how SARS-CoV-2 affects pregnant women and their offspring, as well as which
      factors may influence obstetrical disease and outcomes, including the timing of maternal
      viral exposure by gestational age, the effects of parity, age, host immune responses,
      coexisting medical and obstetrical conditions and the effects of treatment regimens. While
      further information is gathered, based on the existing evidence from other infections causing
      pneumonia, pregnant women should be considered to be at high risk for developing severe
      infection during the current COVID-19 epidemic. Results from clinical trials with HCQ in
      nonpregnant adults may not be directly extrapolated to pregnant women given the special
      features of the pregnancy status. Thus, clinical research is urgently needed to improve the
      care and reduce the risk of poor pregnancy outcomes of women in this and in future epidemics.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial including
      714 pregnant women (200 SARS-CoV-2 infected -100 symptomatic with mild disease and 100
      asymptomatic- pregnant women and 514 SARS-CoV-2 uninfected pregnant women who are contacts
      with a SARS-CoV-2 case) with the main objectives of assessing the safety and efficacy of oral
      hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in reducing maternal viral shedding by PCR, and preventing incident
      SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity. Pregnant women undergoing antenatal follow up at
      five maternity hospitals, presenting at least one sign and/or one mild suggestive symptoms
      and a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, or who are contacts of a suspected or confirmed case,
      will be recruited and randomized 1:1 to receive HCQ orally (400 mg/day for 3 days, followed
      by 200 mg/day for 11 days) or placebo. Women will be followed up for the duration of the
      intervention. One week after intervention completion, a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test will be repeated.
      At delivery, the pregnancy outcome will be registered, and a cord blood sample will be
      collected to measure for IgG and IgM of SARS-CoV-2. A neonatal nasopharyngeal aspirate will
      be collected to perform PCR SARS-CoV-2 testing.
