  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some preliminary epidemiological research conduct in China in health workers involved in the
      care of Covid-19 patients has shown high rates of depression (&gt;50%), generalized anxiety
      disorder (&gt;44%), insomnia (&gt;36%) and stress symptoms (&gt;73%), which negatively impact their
      well-being as well as their ability to work effectively . These rates were observed during
      the epidemic peak, but they can also have a long-term mental health effect, both
      individually, but also in a systemic manner , similar to what has been reported relative to
      the SARS-CoV-1 . Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is recognized as an effective treatment
      for stress-reduction, as well as for the prevention of multiple mental health problems in
      at-risk individuals . Moreover, CBT has been found to be effective in brief online formats ,
      which could make it feasible during the current Covid-19 epidemic. To our knowledge, there
      are no online CBT programmes targeting stress problems in health workers involved in the care
      of patients during the current epidemic context. The aim of our study is to evaluate the
      efficacy of the online CBT programme we have developped to specifically address immediate
      perceived stress in health workers, as well as the prevention of mental health problems at 3-
      and 6-months follow-up
