  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. The current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has a great impact worldwide.
      Healthcare workers play an essential role and are one of the most exposed groups.Information
      about the psychosocial impact on healthcare workers is limited.

      Methods. 3109 healthcare workers completed a national, internet-based, cross-sectional
      45-item survey between 9 and 19 April 2020. The objective is to assess the psychological
      impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spanish healthcare workers. A Psychological Stress and
      Adaptation at work Score (PSAS) was defined combining four modified versions of validated
      psychological assessment tests (A) Healthcare Stressful Test, (B) Coping Strategies
      Inventory,(C) Font-Roja Questionnaire and (D) Trait Meta-Mood Scale.

      PSAS (Psychological Stress and Adaptation at work Score) is a self conducted questionnaire
      designed to assess psychological impact in healthcare workers to match times of crisis and
      when the time is scarce. PSAS has a range between 0 and 105, and higher scores represent
      higher stress detected.
