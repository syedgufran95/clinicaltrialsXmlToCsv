  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This QI project seeks to evaluate the relative test sample acquisition throughput, personal
      protective equipment utilization, and relative operational costs of provider-administered
      COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) nasal samples with and with the use of HEPA-filtered, positive pressure
      isolation booths.

    <textblock>
      Beginning in March 2020, the MGH began outpatient testing for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) utilizing
      a provider-administered nasal swab samples. This was administered with infection control
      protocols utilizing full PPE protection for health providers who would don and doff gowns and
      gloves with each sample acquisition. With an aim to decrease PPE usage and increase
      efficiency, personal protective booths with HEPA-filtered air called &quot;Hexapods&quot; were
      employed, after infection control approval, within the MGH system beginning on April 16,
      2020.

      Ambulatory Care Management at MGH systematically monitors testing completed and PPE usage on
      a weekly basis. Managers in charge of personnel changes shared necessary team structures and
      median salaries for different personnel involved with sample acquisition. MGH Materials
      management were able to report on costs related to consumable supplies used during testing.

      In this investigation, this routinely collected data and averaged timed sample collection
      observations were used to compare before and after the Hexapod utilization.

    <description>Health personnel who utilize the Hexapod will remain in the booth and utilize durable gloves attached to ports through a plexiglass wall in order to administer a nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) testing. Patient escorts and housekeeping/sanitation staff perform additional tasks outside of the booth such as escorting the patient to the correct testing bay and dropping off testing vials and printed information, collect samples and deposit in the appropriate location after testing is complete, and sanitizing the patient bay before a subsequent patient is tested there.</description>
