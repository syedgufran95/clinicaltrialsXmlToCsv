      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK),
      and explore the mechanistic and clinical effect of alvelestat (an oral neutrophil elastase
      inhibitor) orally twice per day for 10 days added to standard of care in adult patients (≥18
      years) with COVID-19 respiratory disease.

          -  Male participants must agree to use a highly effective contraception during the
             treatment period and for at least 4 days after the last dose of study treatment and
             refrain from donating sperm during this period.

          -  Female participants are eligible to participate if not pregnant; not breastfeeding;
             and at least one of the following conditions is met:

        follow the contraceptive guidance during the treatment phase and for at least 4 days after
        the last dose of study medication - Capable of giving signed informed consent which
        includes a commitment to comply with the requirements and restrictions listed in the
        informed consent form (ICF) and within this protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have previously had a score of 6 or 7 on the WHO 9-point Ordinal Scale

          -  Patients who require support with invasive mechanical ventilation at the time of

             limit of normal (ULN) OR Total Bilirubin &gt; ULN. In patients with a documented history
             of Gilbert's Syndrome AND baseline total bilirubin elevation consistent with an
             exacerbation of Gilbert's Syndrome (i.e. no other cause of total bilirubin elevation),
             subjects may enroll if total bilirubin is &lt; 5x ULN.

             ability of the participant to comply with the requirements of the protocol

          -  Any patient whose interests are not best served by study participation, as determined
             by the Investigator

        Excluded Prior/Concomitant Therapy

          -  Requirement for medications mainly metabolized by CYP2C9 and with narrow therapeutic
             index (eg, warfarin, phenytoin) is prohibited unless therapeutic monitoring available
             for duration of alvelestat dosing

          -  Medicines that are potent CYP3A4 inhibitors including (but are not limited to)
             clarithromycin, diltiazem, erythromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, ritonavir,
             verapamil and potent inducers including but not limited to phenobarbital, phenytoin
             and rifampicin, will be exclusionary

          -  Requirement for medications substantially reliant on OATP1B1 for metabolism where
             discontinuation during study drug administration is not possible or where fluctuations
             in levels are considered clinically important (as per investigator judgement) and
             cannot be clinically monitored (e.g., statins, valsartan, olmesartan, enalapril,
             repaglinide)

        Excluded Prior/Concurrent Clinical Study Experience

        - Participation in any clinical investigation using investigational treatments within 4
        weeks or 5 half-lives of the drug (whichever is longer) prior to the initial dosing (or
        longer if required by local regulations) is prohibited. Use of remdesivir (Veklury) under
        the conditions of the authorization for emergency use in the US, and per manufacturer's
        instructions, is permitted.
