  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study the investigators want to learn more about the potential benefit of
      radiation to the lung to improve the health of patients who are hospitalized with
      Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) due to infection with a virus called SARS-CoV-2. This infection
      causes inflammation of the lung, which can make it difficult to breathe. As a result,
      patients may need supplemental oxygen or be placed on a ventilator. The investigators believe
      that low dose radiation therapy to the lung may reduce this inflammation and increase the
      likelihood that patients will need less oxygen support such as ventilation or supplemental
      oxygen, or be discharged from the hospital in fewer days, compared to without radiation
      therapy. The amount of radiation is much lower than what is typically used to treat other
      conditions such as cancer, although it is higher than the dose used for routine medical
      imaging.

    <measure>Phase 2: Proportion with clinical improvement on a 7-point ordinal scale on day 4 after randomization</measure>
    <time_frame>4 days after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The ordinal scale is an assessment of the clinical status on a given day. Each day, the worst (lowest) score from the previous day will be recorded as the score for that previous day.
The scale is as follows:
Death
Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO)
Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices
Hospitalized, requiring low flow supplemental oxygen
Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care (COVID-19 related or otherwise)
Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer required ongoing medical care
Not hospitalized</description>
