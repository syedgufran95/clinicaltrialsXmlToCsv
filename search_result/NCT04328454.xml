    <textblock>
      As of February 17th, 2020, China has 70635 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19), including 1772 deaths. Human-to-human spread of virus via respiratory droplets is
      currently considered to be the main route of transmission. The number of patients increased
      rapidly but the impact factors of clinical outcomes among hospitalized patients are still
      unclear.
