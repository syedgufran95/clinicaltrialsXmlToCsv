  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A team at the University of Manchester are developing a test that tcould be helpful in
      detecting immunity to the Coronavirus (which causes the COVID-19 disease) in participants
      with inflammatory arthritis. It is based on a flu assay has already developed; the team will
      replace the flu antigen with a Coronavirus antigen to see if it is effective.

      This project aims to develop a test to see if people who have had the virus have developed
      immunity to it. This could help to predict who might or might not get the disease a second
      time, who should stay at home to be protected from potential infection or who will not
      develop any symptoms, even if exposed to the virus.

      When vaccination trials against the Coronavirus will be launched, this test could also help
      to see if the vaccine is effective.

    <description>These people will have already provided at least one sample as part of the National Repository Healthy Volunteer Study.
We aim to take blood samples from participants who have recovered from COVID-19 and compare them with blood samples we already have which were taken before the COVID-19 pandemic.
We will need to compare these samples to other samples, so we will also need to blood samples from people who have not had COVID-19 (who have either tested negative or never had any symptoms).</description>
