      This study is a prospective, phase II, multi-center, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mavrilimumab in hospitalized
      patients with acute respiratory failure requiring oxygen supplementation in COVID- 19
      pneumonia and a hyper-inflammatory status. The study will randomize patients to mavrilimumab
      or placebo, in addition to standard of care per local practice. The total trial duration will
      be 12 weeks after single mavrilimumab or placebo dose.

    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of mavrilimumab versus placebo in addition to best
      standard of care (SoC) in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia.

      As of May 13, 2020, COVID-19 has been confirmed in more than 4.2 million people worldwide.
      Mortality rate has been reported to be approximately 3.7%, which is nearly 4 times higher
      than that of influenza: there is an urgent need for effective treatment.

      Accumulating evidence suggests that patients with severe acute COVID-19 pneumonia have a
      cytokine storm syndrome, or unbalanced hyper-inflammatory response resulting in markedly
      elevated cytokine and chemokine production.

      GM-CSF is a cytokine with dual roles as a critical pulmonary hormone and proinflammatory
      properties that can exaggerate tissue inflammation. Recent preliminary uncontrolled clinical
      observations on 13 non-mechanically-ventilated patients in the promoter institution suggest
      that GM-CSF pathway blockade with mavrilimumab is an effective and well-tolerated treatment
      for COVID-19 pneumonia.

      We will perform a prospective, phase II, multi-center, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mavrilimumab in hospitalized
      patients with acute respiratory failure requiring oxygen supplementation in COVID- 19
      pneumonia and a hyper-inflammatory status. The study will randomize
      non-mechanically-ventilated adult patients to mavrilimumab or placebo, in addition to
      standard of care per local practice, which may include but not limited to anti-viral
      treatment, hydroxychloroquine, low-dose corticosteroids (≤ 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent)
      and/or supportive care. The total trial duration will be 12 weeks after single mavrilimumab
      or placebo infusion. Safety will be closely monitored by a dedicated external data safety
      monitoring board (DSMB) at regular intervals during the study.
