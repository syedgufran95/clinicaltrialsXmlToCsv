  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The increase of all-cause mortality in the areas with high COVID-19 transmission rate due to
      COVID-19 deaths and the collateral damage to other healthcare problems is well known.
      However, the COVID-19 mortality is very low in the regions with low transmission rate and
      sufficient medical resources. In such regions, strict prevention measures were taken and
      these would alter the people's lifestyle and hygienic habits and further impact on
      non-COVID-19 deaths. Yet, there has no thorough investigation in this aspect.

      Background The increase of all-cause mortality in the areas with high COVID-19 transmission
      rate due to COVID-19 deaths and the collateral damage to other healthcare problems is well
      known. However, the COVID-19 mortality is very low in the regions with low transmission rate
      and sufficient medical resources. In such regions, strict prevention measures were taken and
      these would alter the people's lifestyle and hygienic habits and further impact on
      non-COVID-19 deaths. Yet, there has no thorough investigation in this aspect.

      Methods The number of registered deaths among 8.8 million permanent residents with specific
      causes from January 2018 to June 2020 were sourced from the Xuzhou Center for Disease Control
      and Prevention, Jiangsu Province, China. Death rates were calculated and compared by weeks,
      months, and years with a focus on the period of COVID-19 pandemic from Jan 24 to March 27,
      2020. Numeric values of all-cause death and the death rates of non-COVID diseases were
      compared in time series at different time scales.
