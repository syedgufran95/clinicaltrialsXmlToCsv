  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in the UCKWUM teaching hospital in Warsaw between 2020 and 2022.
      The study group will be comprised of UCKWUM healthcare professionals All employees willing to
      participate in the study will receive an anonymous questionnaire on attitudes towards
      influenza vaccination . We will distribute information posters of the National Programme for
      Combating Influenza as part of the educational programme. In order to increase the
      effectiveness of the educational campaign, we will also send information e-mails, using the
      internal hospital e-mail system and conduct a series of online training courses to present
      the latest international reports on influenza vaccinations among health care professionals
      [CITATION Abr10 \l 1045].

      Considering the fact that lack of time [CITATION Kus11 \l 1045] is the most common reason for
      not getting vaccinated against influenza among healthcare professionals, we will provide this
      group with an opportunity to receive free influenza vaccination during working hours at the
      UCKWUM hospital. Information about the possibility of vaccination will be provided in the
      form of e-mails (mailings) to hospital employees (internal hospital e-mail system), letters
      of information submitted to the offices of individual departments, and information posters.

      The effectiveness of the educational programme will be assessed by re-administering the
      anonymous questionnaires after the influenza season, also by means of internal hospital
      e-mail system.
