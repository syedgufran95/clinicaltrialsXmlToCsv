  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this preliminary study is to describe the potential decline in forced expiratory
      volume in 1 second (FEV1) or forced vital capacity (FVC) as measured by home spirometry in
      high-risk subjects infected with COVID-19. We hypothesize that the magnitude of such a
      decline in FEV1 and/or FVC may be associated with clinical deterioration and hospitalization.
      The study will ultimately inform a larger subsequent RCT that will evaluate the efficacy of
      home spirometry in the early detection (pre respiratory symptoms) of respiratory
      complications and therefore prompt early medical attention which is a key for improving
      outcome.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. without dyspnea and with no evidence of pneumonia, ARDS, organ failure or requiring
             admission to ICU.

          2. All patients ≥55 years age or ≥1 risk factor for disease complications (prior
             pulmonary, kidney or cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, bone
             merrow suppression, solid organ transplant, HIV with CD4&lt;250, heavy smoker, BMI &gt;30).
             All participants will sign a written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients unable to perform spirometry

          2. contraindications for spirometry (hemoptysis, active tuberculosis, syncope associated
             with forced exhalation or increased risk for spirometry)

          3. adhere to the follow-up protocol.
