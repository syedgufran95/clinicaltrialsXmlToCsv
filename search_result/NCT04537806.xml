        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has been confirmed positive for the novel coronavirus responsible for
             COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) infection as determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at
             Screening

          -  Participant has a presumptive diagnosis of ARDS at Screening and partial pressure of
             arterial oxygen (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) (PF ratio) &lt; 300 prior to
             randomization

          -  Participant is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation prior to randomization

          -  Participants must have initiated mechanical ventilation within 48 hours prior to
             screening, or have an immediate clinical plan for such intervention at time of
             screening

          -  Participant is likely to survive, in the opinion of the investigator, for at least 72
             hours from the time of screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has fulminant hepatic failure at Screening

          -  Participant has end stage renal disease at Screening

          -  Participant has a known allergy to progesterone, allopregnanolone, or any excipients
             in the brexanolone injection

          -  Be concurrently participating in another clinical trial for an investigational product
             or device at screening
