      Agent Name and Study Duration

      ArtemiC is a medical spray comprised of Artemisinin (6 mg/ml), Curcumin (20 mg/ml),
      Frankincense (=Boswellia) (15 mg/ml) and vitamin C (60 mg/ml) in micellar formulation for
      spray administration.

      Patients will receive up to 6 mg Artemisinin, 20 mg Curcumin, 15 mg Frankincense and 60 mg
      vitamin C given daily as an add-on therapy (in addition to standard care) in two divided
      doses, on Days 1 and 2.

      Patients will be randomized in a manner of 2:1 for study drug (ArteminC) and Standard of Care
      to Placebo and Standard of Care.

      Patient follow-up will last 2 weeks. During this time, patients will be monitored for adverse
      events.

      Additional time will be required for follow up (until hospital discharge) in order to check
      side effects and study drug efficacy.

      Placebo, composed of the same solvent but without active ingredients, will be given in the
      placebo group as add-on therapy, 2 times a day, on Days 1 and 2.

      Overall rationale A preparation of ArtemiC, comprising Artemisinin, Curcumin, Boswellia, and
      Vitamin C in a nanoparticular formulation, is proposed as a treatment for the disease
      associated with the novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2. It is readily available in light of its
      status as a food supplement. This initiative is presented under the urgent circumstances of
      the fulminant pandemic caused by this lethal disease, which is known as COVID-19 and has
      spread across the globe causing death and disrupting the normal function of modern society.
      The grounds for the proposal are rooted in existing knowledge on the components and
      pharmacological features of this formulation and their relevance to the current understanding
      of the disease process being addressed.

      Leading among these considerations are well established immuno-modulatory activities of the
      active ingredients as established in vitro and in vivo and published over the years. These
      activities as apparent, for example, in diminishing activity of TNF alpha and IL-6 levels are
      acknowledged to be relevant to the pathophysiology processes involved in the progressive form
      of COVID-19. The active agents have in addition prominent anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory as
      well as anti-aggregant and anti-microbial activities.

      Based on these activities and observations in animal models, together with clinical
      experience of the separate ingredients and in various combinations in other contexts it is
      proposed to evaluate their effect in the context of COVID-19.

      Study Purpose This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ArtemiC on
      patients diagnosed with COVID-19.

      Methodology 50 adult patients who suffer from COVID-19 infection studied in parallel groups
      treated with active agent or placebo as add on to standard care.

      Safety will be assessed through collection and analysis of adverse events, blood and urine
      laboratory assessments and vital signs.

      STUDY OBJECTIVES This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ArtemiC on
      patients diagnosed with COVID-19.

      STUDY TREATMENT AND DESIGN 50 adult patients who suffer from COVID-19 infection, and do not
      participant in any other clinical trial.

      Patient must agree to not participate in any new clinical study during the study duration.

      ArtemiC is a medical spray combined of Artemisinin (6 mg/ml), Curcumin (20 mg/ml),
      Frankincense (15 mg/ml) and vitamin C (60 mg/ml) in spray administration.

      It has a current status as a food supplement. Patients will receive up to 12 mg Artemisinin,
      40 mg Curcumin, 30 mg Frankincense and 120 mg vitamin C in 2ml as a total maximum dose, given
      as add-on therapy, comprised of 2 daily doses of 0.5 ml each, on Days 1 and 2. Each dose
      contains 0.5 ml (total 1 ml daily dose), which is equal to 5 pushes on the spray bottle.

      Placebo, composed of the same solvent but without active ingredients, will be given as add-on
      therapy in the placebo group, 2 times a day, on Days 1 and 2.

      Patients will be randomized in a manner of 2:1 for study drug (ArteminC) and Standard of Care
      to Placebo and Standard of Care.

      The study will last 2 weeks. During this time, patients will be monitored for adverse events.

      Additional time will be required for follow up (until hospital discharge) in order to check
      side effects and study drug efficacy.

      STUDY PROCEDURES

      Evaluation of the effect of oral administration of the study drug will be assessed by
      determining the clinical and laboratory tests as summarized below:

      Biochemistry Blood Test: Sodium (Na), Potassium (K), Chloride (Cl), Creatinine, Glucose,
      Urea, Albumin, Calcium total, Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), ALT, AST, Total Bilirubin, Direct
      Bilirubin, LDH, Total Protein, Uric Acid, CRP, and Lipid Profile (including Total
      Cholesterol, HDL, LDL, Triglycerides), D-dimer, ESR as well as Troponin as required.It will
      be performed per institutional schedule.

      Hematology Blood Test: complete CBC. It will be performed per institutional schedule.

      Vital signs: blood pressure, pulse, weight, height, temperature. It will be performed per
      institutional schedule.
