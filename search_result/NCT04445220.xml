  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of the investigational
      product, SBI-101, in COVID-19 subjects with Acute Kidney Injury (AKI). SBI-101 is a
      biologic/device combination product designed to regulate inflammation and promote repair of
      injured tissue using allogeneic human mesenchymal stromal cells. SBI-101 will be integrated
      into the renal replacement circuit and patients will be treated for up to 24 hours.

    <description>SBI-101 is a biologic/device combination product that combines two components: allogeneic human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and an FDA-approved plasmapheresis device. SBI-101 is administered via integration into a Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy circuit and is designed to regulate inflammation and promote repair of injured tissue.</description>
