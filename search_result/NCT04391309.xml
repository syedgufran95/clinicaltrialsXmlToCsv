  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 study of IC14, an
      antibody to CD14, in reducing the severity of respiratory disease in hospitalized COVID-19
      patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to test the efficacy and safety of IC14, an antibody to the CD14
      pattern-recognition receptor, in reducing the severity of respiratory disease in patients
      hospitalized with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes the clinical illness known as COVID-19.

      Specific Aim 1. Determine the efficacy and safety of IC14, an anti-CD14 chimeric antibody, in
      patients hospitalized with respiratory disease due to SARS-CoV-2, in terms of increasing the
      number of days alive and free of any episodes of acute respiratory failure through Day 22.

      Specific Aim 2. Determine whether treatment with the IC14 antibody improves time to
      improvement in clinical status using an eight-point ordinal scale.

      Three hundred patients will be randomized to IC14 (n=150) or placebo (n=150). Study drug will
      be administered daily on Days 1-4. Study participation will continue for 60 days after
      enrollment. Remdesivir concomitant therapy will be given.

The Eight-Point Ordinal Scale is an assessment of the clinical status at the first assessment of a given study day. The scale is as follows: 1) Death; 2) Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); 3) Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen devices; 4) Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 5) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen-requiring ongoing medical care (COVID-19-related or otherwise); 6) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen-no longer requires ongoing medical care; 7) Not hospitalized, limitation on activities and/or requiring home oxygen; 8) Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities.</description>
