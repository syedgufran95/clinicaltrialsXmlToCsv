      Methodology:

      This is a controlled, randomized, multicenter open-label Phase Ib clinical exploratory trial
      in patients with fibrosing interstitial lung disease secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      Patients who give informed consent will be screened for enrolment in the study. Patients that
      meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled and randomly allocated in the control arm
      (best standard of care) or the experimental arm (best standard of care plus IN01
      vaccination).

      The patients enrolled in the control arm of the study will receive standard of care.

      The primary endpoint is safety, measured by the Frequency and severity of AEs graded
      according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 criteria.
      Biochemical and blood count alterations will be also monitored. Safety will be defined based
      on the frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs) throughout the patient's participation
      in the study comparing between control and experimental arms.

      Efficacy will be measured as function of the annual rate of decline in the Forced Vital
      Capacity (FVC) at 1 year after patient inclusion in the study and the blood oxygen saturation
      levels at days 1, 14 (w2), d 28 (w4), 42 (w6) and 92 (w12); week 24, week 36 and week 52.
      High-resolution Computed Tomography (CT) scans will be taken at at baseline and weeks, 12,
      24, and 52 to evaluate the resolution of the fibrosing interstitial lung disease.

      A translational substudy will be included.

      Objectives:

      Primary Objective

      ● To evaluate the safety and tolerability of IN01 vaccine in diagnosed ex-COVID-19 patients
      that develop fibrotic lung syndrome after infection.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To evaluate the effect of IN01 vaccine on Oxygen saturation, pulmonary function, quality
           of life and fibrosing status in ex-COVID-19 patients that developed fibrosing lung
           disease after infection.

        -  To assess biomarkers and molecular markers related to the IN01 vaccine mechanism of
           action.

    <description>The investigational medical product, the IN01 vaccine, will be administered in two phases to those patients in the experimental arm: the induction phase and the maintenance phase. During the induction phase IN01 vaccine will be administered on day 1 and will be repeated on Day 14, Day 28, Day 42 and day 56. During the maintenance phase, the vaccination will be administered every 2 months with the same dosage and administration mode as during induction.</description>

    <intervention_name>IN01 vaccine</intervention_name>
    <description>INO1 vaccine is a biological compound comprising generated and purified from recombinant bacteria culture that contains a protein consisting of EGF-4-EGF portion and the Cholera Toxin B-Subunit Domain G33D sequence (CTB-G33D) separated by 4 amino acids and 14 amino acids respectively glycine/serine-rich linkers.
IN01 is a recombinant growth factor fusion molecule which, once injected into the patient, stimulates the immune system to produce polyclonal anti-Epidermal Growth Factor (anti-EGF) neutralizing antibodies. This vaccine-led active immunisation is a new approach to target the growth factor pathways allowing for combinations with other small molecule inhibitors in order to obtain a sustained efficacy with an acceptable toxicity.
The vaccine inhibits binding of circulating Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) to its receptor, EGF-R to block downstream activation of cell signaling pathways contributing to tumor growth or other pathophysiologies such as fibrosis.</description>
