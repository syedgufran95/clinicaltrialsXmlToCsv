  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, nearly 2 million people, including at least 100,000 in France, have been infected
      with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). This infection is very
      heterogeneous in nature, ranging from asymptomatic forms to acute respiratory distress
      syndrome patterns in 6.1% of cases, leading to an estimated overall mortality of 5.2%.

      Apart from age, few risk factors for a pejorative evolution have been identified: arterial
      hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular history, obesity and chronic respiratory pathology in
      particular. The median incubation period is 5 days and the median time between the appearance
      of the first symptoms and the onset of hypoxia requiring admission to intensive care is 7 to
      12 days. The mechanisms involved in the occurrence of these secondary worsening patterns are
      unclear. One hypothesis is that it is related to an inappropriate inflammatory response
      rather than a direct cytopathic effect of the virus. The objective of this study is to
      measure the intensity of the T lymphocyte response in patients hospitalized for Cov2 SARS
      infection in order to determine whether the intensity of the response is associated with
      worsening of symptoms.
