  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 has rapidly evolved into a generalized global pandemic. Post-exposure prophylaxis
      (PEP) against on COVID-19 was identified as an urgent research priority by the WHO, and
      lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) is a promising candidate for both COVID-19 treatment and PEP,
      with a good safety profile and global availability. This is a cluster randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) of oral LPV/r as PEP against COVID-19, that will address the immediate need for
      preventive interventions, generate key data on COVID-19 transmission, and serve as a research
      platform for future vaccines and preventive agents.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. High risk close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case during their symptomatic
             period, including one day before symptom onset, within the past 1-7 days. High risk
             close contact is defined as any of the following exposures without the consistent
             appropriate use of recommended personal protective equipment:

               1. Provided direct care for the index case

               2. Had close physical contact with the index case

               3. Lived with the index case

               4. Had close contact (within 2 metres), without direct physical contact, for a
                  prolonged period of time

               5. Had direct contact with infectious body fluids, including oral secretions,
                  respiratory secretions, or stool.

          2. Successfully contacted by the study team within 24 hours of study team notification of
             the relevant index COVID-19 case. This time window is necessary because the efficacy
             of PEP may be dependent on the timing of its initiation, and because randomization of
             a ring cannot be delayed while awaiting response from contacts that cannot be rapidly
             reached.

          3. Age ≥6 months, since the safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of LPV/r in pediatric
             patients below the age of 6 months have not been established.

          4. Ability to communicate with study staff in English

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known hypersensitivity/allergy to lopinavir or ritonavir.

          2. Current use of LPV/r for the treatment or prevention of HIV infection.

          3. Receipt of LPV/r in the context of this trial or any other trial of COVID-19 PEP
             within 2 days or less prior to the last known contact with the index COVID-19 case.
             The two day time window is intended to ensure that exposure would not have occurred in
             the presence of clinically relevant drug levels (five times the elimination half-life
             of LPV/r, which is estimated at 4-6 hours with prolonged use).

          4. Baseline respiratory tract specimen positive for COVID-19. Randomized participants
             whose baseline samples subsequently show COVID-19 will have study drug discontinued
             but still remain under observation.

          5. Current breastfeeding, due to potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing
             infants exposed to LPV/r

          6. Concomitant medications with prohibited drug interactions with LPV/r that cannot be
             temporarily suspended/replaced, including but not restricted to: 37

                  methylergonovine*

               -  fusidic acid (e.g., Fucidin®), systemic*

               -  lurasidone (e.g., Latuda®), pimozide (e.g., Orap®*)

                  Zocor®)

               -  vardenafil (e.g., Levitra® or Staxyn®)

               -  salmeterol (e.g., Advair® or Serevent®)
