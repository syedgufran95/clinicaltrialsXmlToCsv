  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory study to evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (400 mg BID on D1
      and 400 mg/day on D2 to D5) and azithromycin (500 mg/ 5 days) to treat moderate to severe
      COVID-19 pneumonia.

      This is an exploratory, open label, multi-center study to evaluate the efficacy of
      hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (400 mg BID on D1 and 400 mg/day on D2 to D5) and azithromycin (AZT)
      (500 mg/ 5 days) to treat moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

      We aim to demonstrate decrease in hospital related complications among patients who are
      hospitalized with moderate or severe COVID-19 by treating them with HCQ and AZT on top of
      standard care compared to patients who receive standard care only.

      Patients hospitalized with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 will receive the treatment.

      Patients that do not fulfill the inclusion/exclusion criteria or that is not willing to
      participate in the study will be invited to consent the use of their data as part of a
      &quot;control&quot; group.
