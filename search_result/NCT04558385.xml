      This study investigate the kinetics of IgG responses to both N and S proteins in the subjects
      who suffered from COVID 19 and then had recovered.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, single positive-strand RNA viruses belonging to the large
      subfamily Coronavirinae, which can infect mammals and several other animals.The continued
      spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has prompted widespread concern around the
      world, and the World Health Organization (WHO), on 11 March 2020, declared COVID-19 a
      pandemic. Studies on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory
      syndrome (MERS) showed that virus-specific antibodies were detectable in 80-100% of patients
      at 2 weeks after symptom onset. Currently, the antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 remain
      poorly understood and the clinical utility of serological testing is unclear Little is known
      about the kinetics, tissue distribution, cross-reactivity and neutralization antibody
      response in COVID-19 patients .

      The seropositivity rate of both IgM and IgG responses after onset and recovery of disease,
      and in the context of both N protein and S protein has not been clarified. The kinetics of
      antibody responses in critical cases or ICU patients has not been reported, and no studies
      have suggested whether antibody response is associated with disease prognosis
