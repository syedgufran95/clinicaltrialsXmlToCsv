  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent months, a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has been identified as the cause of a
      serious lung infection named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. This virus has spread
      rapidly among the nations of the world and it is the cause of a pandemic and a global health
      emergency. There is still very little scientific evidence on the virus, however
      epidemiological data suggest that one of the most frequent comorbidities is diabetes, along
      with hypertension and heart disease. There is no scientific evidence on the possible effects
      of this infection on the function of the β cell and on glycemic control. Clinical evidence
      seems to suggest that COVID-19 infection mostly affects the respiratory system, and an acute
      worsening of glycemic compensation is not described as generally observed in bacterial
      pneumonia. However, previous work on acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) caused by similar
      coronaviruses, had described that the infection has multi-organ involvement related to the
      expression of the SARS coronavirus receptor, the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme, in
      different organs, especially at the level of endocrine pancreatic tissue. In the population
      of this previous work, glucose intolerance and fasting hyperglycaemia have been described and
      in 37 of 39 diabetic patients examined, a remission of diabetes was observed three years
      after the infection. It is possible that the coronaviruses responsible for SARS may enter the
      pancreatic islets using the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme receptor, expressed at the level
      of the endocrine pancreas, thus causing diabetes. Additionally, previous literature on
      coronavirus infections (SARS and MERS or Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome) suggested that
      diabetes could worsen the evolution of the disease. In particular, in case of Middle-East
      Respiratory Syndrome-CoV infection, diabetic mice had a more prolonged serious illness and a
      delay in recovery regardless of the viremic titer. This could probably be due to a
      dysregulation of the immune response, which results in more serious and prolonged lung
      disease.

      There are currently no data on pancreatic beta cell function in patients with COVID-19.

      The project is monocentric, interventional, non-pharmacological, non-profit. Patients will be
      enrolled in hospital for confirmed COVID-19 infection (with reverse transcriptase-polymerase
      chain reaction on the airway swab) but with normal basal blood glucose and no previous
      history of diabetes or impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance. Patients will
      be compared to a control group of healthy volunteers, not affected by COVID-19 and with no
      previous history of diabetes or impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance. Once
      the informed consent has been signed, the clinical parameters and biochemical parameters will
      be collected according to the time points provided by the protocol both in positive COVID-19
      patients and in healthy volunteers.

      COVID-19 positive patients and healthy controls will undergo a stimulation test of β-cell
      function (evaluation of the secretive response of insulin to the stimulation test with
      arginine infusion) and the monitoring of glycemic values through a professional retrospective
      continuous glucose monitoring. For the test, an infusion solution containing 25% arginine
      hydrochloride will be used, arginine is an insulinogenic amino acid, useful to verify the
      possible existence of damage to the cellular beta function induced by COVID-19 infection,
      clinically observable with changes in insulin secretory response. Given the usefulness of the
      test, performed for diagnostic purposes, this protocol is identified as
      &quot;non-pharmacological&quot;. The test is contraindicated only in patients with severe hepatic and
      renal insufficiency, in all other subjects the side effects are minimal and spontaneous
      resolution before the end of the test (flushing 33%, oral paraesthesia 46%, nausea 12%,
      dizziness 14%). For the stimulation test with arginine infusion, after the basal sampling at
      (0 minutes), an intravenous injection of arginine 5 grams will be practiced in 60 seconds
      followed by serial withdrawals at +2, +5, +10 and +30 minutes. The following analytes will be
      assayed on the basal sample: glycosylated hemoglobin, glycaemia, insulin, pro-insulin,
      C-peptide, glucagon, serum inflammatory cytokines (Il1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, TNF- α,
      IFN-γ, MIP-1β, MCP-1, GM-CSF, G-CSF Insulin, C-peptide and glucagon will be dosed on all
      points of the curve.
