  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proportion of asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 remains elusive, so the potential
      benefit of systematic screening during the SARS-CoV-2-pandemic is controversial. We
      investigate the proportion of asymptomatic inpatients who were identified by systematic
      screening for SARS-CoV-2 upon hospital admission.

      Adult patients admitted to the University Hospital Basel from 01.04.-14.06.2020 were
      routinely tested for SARS-CoV-2 within 72 hours of admission by nasopharyngeal swabs.

      Each patient screened during the study period was retrospectively classified symptomatic or
      asymptomatic for COVID-19 based on medical chart review.
