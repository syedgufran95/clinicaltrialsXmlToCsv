  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project, we aimed at developing new &quot;Ready-to-Use&quot; inhalable forms of HCQ that can be
      used directly through nebulization or using dry powder inhalers (DPIs). These inhaled forms
      would allow a simple and direct delivery of the drug (HCQ) specifically towards the throat
      and the lung which are the main sites for the COVID-19 viral infection. Hence, the drug can
      be available at higher concentrations in the throat and lungs as compared with the currently
      used treatment protocols, while minimizing the drug systemic concentrations and its presence
      in other body organs, and thus enhancing the drug efficacy with significantly limiting its
      side effects. Besides, using inhalable forms can be more convenient to patients suffering
      from gastrointestinal complications from the disease that can limit the absorption of oral
      forms. Moreover, the proposed inhalable forms are designed in such a way to hide the drug
      from the immune system (confer stealth characteristics) using FDA-approved excipients to
      minimize/avoid any immune response towards the drug as was noted towards it in its oral form
      that's used in the treatment protocol of COVID-19. In addition, the inhaled formulations will
      be designed to maintain the overall simplicity and scalability of the preparation which is
      critical during this urgent pandemic situation. The cost of the final formulation is also
      taken into consideration since the drug is intended for treatment of thousands or probably
      millions of patients around the world including countries with limited economic capabilities.

    <intervention_model_description>The first 20 consecutive patients (group A) will be treated by oral antibiotics, supportive treatment and inhalable hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). (In day 1, an inhaled hydroxychloroquine sulfate dose of 12 mg will be taken via nebulization three times/day (TID) as a loading dose. Then, starting from day 2, same dose of 12 mg of inhaled hydroxychloroquine will be taken twice/day (BID) as maintenance dose for 5 days. The subsequent 20 consecutive patients (group B) will receive the same treatment of group A but without inhalable hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). At day 7, all patients of both groups will be evaluated by clinical, laboratory and chest CT parameters. Patients of group B who still show no clinical, laboratory or radiological improvement will continue treatment by adding inhalable hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). for another 7 days and re-evaluated at day 14. Patients of group A who still show no significant improvement at day 7 only will be re-checked at day 14.</intervention_model_description>
