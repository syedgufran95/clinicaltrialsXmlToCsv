  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This cross-sectional study will allow to collect eating behaviours data during the COVID-19
      confinement, some of them related to the Mediterranean Diet to better understand the eating
      behaviours of adult population during this novel and exceptional situation.

      Hypothesis: The eating habits of the population together with physical activity level will
      change during the COVID-19 outbreak confinement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Around thirty thousand adults (18 years old and older) will be recruited from 22 different
      countries (i.e. including Bosnia and Herzegovina, Colombia, Croatia, Denmark, Egypt, Germany,
      Greece, India, Ireland, Italy, Kosovo, Kuwait, Lithuania, Montenegro, North Macedonia,
      Poland, Portugal, Serbia, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey and United Kingdom). A self-administered
      web-based questionnaire with questions aimed at assessing the dietary behaviours of the adult
      population during the COVID-19 confinement and before it started, will be distributed using
      social media and snowball sampling. The questionnaire is based on 44 items including
      socio-demographic data, MEditerranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) as a reference of a
      healthy diet, processed foods intake, changes in their usual food choices and weight gain.
      All data will be collected online to reach the largest number of participants from all
      territories.

      The main objectives of this study are: 1) to examine whether the COVID-19 outbreak
      confinement has influenced eating habits among the adult population from the 22 countries
      previously detailed, and 2) to assess the differences in eating behaviours between the
      countries involved in the study to have a global overview of the behaviour in the face of
      confinement that helps in public health decision making related to positive impact on the
      prevention of chronic diseases and COVID-19-related complications.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to the Mediterranean diet before and during the COVID-19 confinement</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Part of the questionnaire based on the validated PREDIMED MEditerranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS-14). Briefly, one point is scored when the following choices are selected: olive oil for cooking, daily consumption of four or more tablespoons of olive oil, white meat vs. red meat, two or more servings of vegetables, three or more pieces of fruit, less than one serving of red meat, hamburgers, sausages or deli meats, less than one serving of carbonated or sugary drinks, weekly intake of seven or more glasses of wine, three or more servings of legumes, three or more servings of fish/seafood, three or more servings of nuts, less than two servings of non-homemade pastries, white meat such as turkey or chicken preference instead red meat and two or more dishes seasoned with tomato, garlic, onion or leeks and sautéed with olive oil (sofrito).
The MEDAS-14 score ranges from 0 to 14, whereby higher a scoring reflects greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Eating behaviours</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Part of the questionnaire based on changes in frequency of cooking, snacking, alcohol, fast-food intake (higher, lower or similar) and fried foods intake (&lt;1 time a week, 1-3 times a week, 4-6 times a week, 7 or more than 7 times a week, never), type of oil employed for frying (olive oil, sunflower oil or other), number of main daily meals out of home before the confinement (0,1, 2 or 3), difficult finding any type of food (yes/no) or perception of being eating more during the confinement (yes/no).
In this case, better outcomes are expected if participants increase or maintain the frequency of cooking, use olive oil for frying and decrease or maintain the frequency of snacking, alcohol, fast-food or fried foods intake. Additionally, a good outcome will be considered if participants do not eat more during the confinement and if they do not have problems in finding any type of food.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Level of physical activity during the COVID-19 confinement</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire includes a question regarding the level of physical activity during the COVID-19 confinement in which the following options are provided: it has increased, it has decreased, it remains as usual, I do not practice physical activity.
The best outcome will be considered if the participants maintain or increase their physical activity level during the COVID-19 confinement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Weight gain during the COVID-19 confinement</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire includes a question about the perception or weight gain during the confinement (increased/decreased/Unknown).
The best outcome will be considered if the participants do not increase weight during the COVID-19 confinement.</description>
