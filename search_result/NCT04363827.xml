  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Italian, superiority, open label cluster-randomised, interventional clinical trial
      aimed at assessing whether the treatment with Hydroxychloroquine can reduce the percentage of
      symptomatic subjects compared to observation only in household members/contacts of COVID-19
      patients (Group 1) and if the treatment with Hydroxychloroquine could be introduced in early
      phase COVID-19 population (Group 2).

      The participants will be randomised to receive either:

      Arm A) hydroxychloroquine vs Arm B) Observation (2:1 randomisation).

      This is an open label, superiority, cluster-randomized Italian interventional clinical trial,
      evaluating the role of Hydroxychloroquine versus observation only in preventing infection to
      COVID-19 or treating early phase COVID-19 patients.

      Each index case is randomised to either Arm A: Hydroxychloroquine or Arm B: observation in a
      2:1 ratio on an open label basis. Participants in the same cluster receive the same
      intervention.

      Study population is constituted by:

      Group 1: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - Corona Virus (CoV)-2-exposed subjects ,
      as household members/contacts of COVID-19 patients.

      Group 2: Patients with COVID-19 asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic in home situation.
