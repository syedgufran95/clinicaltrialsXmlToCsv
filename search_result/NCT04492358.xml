        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be at least 65 years old and be admitted to the Geriatrics Unit of the Internal
             Medicine Service (Hospital Clínic de Barcelona) or to a transicional care center

          2. Clinical diagnosis compatible with COVID-19 (in a favourable epidemiological context),
             with a disease considered moderate (grade 3-4) or severe (grade 5) according to the
             WHO 8-point ordinal scale for assessing clinical severity
             (https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/covid-19-therapeutic-trial-synopsis). This
             same scale will also be used to evaluate the evolution after the application of the
             corresponding treatment. Baseline clinical parameters will include the presentation of
             fever and any respiratory symptoms, both of upper respiratory tract and dyspnea,
             affecting the general state or gastrointestinal manifestations, since it is known that
             in elderly people the COVID-19 can present with atypical symptoms for a time that is
             difficult to determine, but it also tends to evolve to respiratory failure quickly and
             is associated with high mortality. For this reason, regardless of the time that has
             elapsed since the estimated onset of symptoms, patients with moderate - WHO grade 3,
             in whom the presence of fever, mild dyspnea or any gastrointestinal manifestation
             attributable to COVID-19 make an admission (in the case of hospital) and directed
             treatment (in all cases) advisable, will be candidates for inclusion in the study.
             Patients with moderate disease and oxygen requirements (WHO grade 4) and patients with
             severe pneumonia, but who can be managed initially with high flow oxygen therapy (WHO
             grade 5) may also be included in the study. The clinical diagnosis may be supported by
             radiological changes (via chest radiography, if available) suggestive of bilateral
             (established or incipient) pneumonia. At the time of diagnosis, biomarkers will also
             be collected, in an analysis that will include increased levels of C-reactive protein
             [PCR] and/or ferritin and microbiological confirmation of SARS-CoV-2.

          3. Patients in whom the current clinical situation and the basal functional situation
             condition a prognosis that makes them consider a limited therapeutic ceiling, which
             includes the contraindication of applying more aggressive (e.g. non-invasive
             ventilation) or invasive measures (e.g. cardiopulmonary resuscitation or orotracheal
             intubation and mechanical ventilation), both in patients admitted to the Geriatric
             Unit (Hospital Clínic de Barcelona) and in those admitted to a transicional care
             center. The latter patients are also not considered for transfer to a third level
             hospital (according to the criteria of fragility, available on page 14 of the CatSalut
             action protocols
             (https://canalsalut.gencat.cat/web/.content/_A-Z/C/coronavirus-2019-ncov/material-divu
             lgatiu/recull-protocol-pneumonia.pdf).

          4. Patient with a general condition that allows him/her to take the medication orally,
             without risk of bronchial aspiration.

          5. Acceptance by the patient or responsible family member to participate in the study
             (written consent).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The clinical situation of an advanced or terminal illness, according to the clinical
             judgment of the doctor in charge and as defined by the Spanish Society for Palliative
             Care (SECPAL), which describes it as an advanced illness in an evolutionary and
             irreversible phase with multiple symptoms, emotional impact, loss of autonomy, with
             very little or no capacity to respond to specific treatment and with a life expectancy
             limited to weeks or months, in a context of progressive fragility
             (http://envejecimiento.csic.es/documentos/documentos/navarro-cuidadospaliativos-01.pdf
             ).

          2. Clinical status which is advanced and severe or in which the level of consciousness
             has deteriorated and the oral route of taking the medication is not safely tolerated
             (in the opinion of the doctor in charge)

          3. Taking any of the drugs in the trial (colchicine or prednisone) chronically or
             intermittently in the 7 days prior to study inclusion.

          4. Absolute contraindication to the use of the study medication, including
             hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of its excipients, severe renal
             failure (glomerular filtration [GF] creatinine clearance or Clcr &lt;30 ml/min) and
             patients undergoing haemodialysis, severe liver failure, severe gastrointestinal
             disorders, gastric ulcer or blood dyscrasias.

          5. Concomitant treatment with macrolides (clarithromycin, erythromycin, telithromycin),
             antifungals (itraconazole, ketoconazole), cyclosporine and antivirals
             (lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir), all potent inhibitors of
             CYP3A4 (key cytochrome in the colchicine metabolism pathway).
