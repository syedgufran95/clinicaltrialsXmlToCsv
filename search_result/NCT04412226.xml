  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the impact of using the aerosol box and transparent sheet
      as an adjunct to conventional personal protective equipment on endotracheal intubation of
      COVID-19 patients. The effect of the head of the bed elevation will also be evaluated during
      the mentioned simulated scenarios.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, prospective, manikin simulation study. Emergency medicine specialists
      will be participated in the study. Participants will be randomly assigned into 6 groups with
      a 1:1:1:1:1:1 allocation following simple randomization procedures by a program generating
      online random numbers. 13 participants will be recruited to the study.

      Operators who will intubate the manikin will use following methods: (1) conventional personal
      protective equipment (PPE) with placing the manikin in the supine position. (2) aerosol box
      as an adjunct to PPE with placing the manikin in the supine position. (3) transparent sheet
      as an adjunct to PPE with placing the manikin in the supine position. (4) conventional
      personal protective equipment (PPE) with placing the manikin in the 30 degree the head of the
      bed elevated position. (5) aerosol box as an adjunct to PPE with placing the manikin in the
      30 degree the head of the bed elevated position. (6) transparent sheet as an adjunct to PPE
      with placing the manikin in the 30 degree the head of the bed elevated position.

    <description>The aerosol box is a barrier that protects the staff against the aerosols during the aerosol generating procedures like endotracheal intubation. It is a transparent cube that covers the patient's head during the endotracheal intubation. Operator can intubate the patient through the two holes for arms.</description>
