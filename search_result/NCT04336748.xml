      Background:

      Aim: To demonstrate the efficacy of low-dose hydroxychloroquine as primary prevention in
      healthcare workers Design, participants and interventions: Prospective, randomized, parallel
      group, double-blinded, placebo controlled, study.

      including 440 participants who will be randomised to 2 treatment arms: hydroxychloroquine or
      placebo.

      Outcome variables: symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by PCR, viral
      load during SARS-CoV-2 infection, seroconversion during the study period, incidence of any
      acute respiratory infection, days of sick leave.

      Statistical considerations: No trials have been published investigating the efficacy of HCQ
      as primary prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health care workers. Thus, sample size
      calculations in the proposed trial are based on the investigators' best estimates for several
      parameters.

      In accordance to the effect of oseltamivir against symptomatic influenza, we assumed an
      approximate effectiveness of approximately 60% (HR of 0.4)
      (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6464969/) as realistic. As a prophylactic
      intervention with HCQ, which may have side effects and for which supply shortage can be
      expected, was judged justifiable only if its effectiveness is high, we based our sample size
      consideration on a HR of 0.3. To estimate the probability of an event in both the
      experimental and the control group, very little data is available. In a Dutch
      point-prevalence study 0-10% of health-care workers were infected depending on the healthcare
      institution, depending on the hospital. This point-prevalence study was performed between 6
      and 9 March, when the reported number of cases in the Netherlands was 33 and 77,
      respectively, according to the RIVM
      (https://www.rivm.nl/nieuws/resultaat-steekproef-4-ziekenhuismedewerkers-heeft-coronavirus).
      Additionally, in an a report published in the Lancet, 20% of responding healthcare workers in
      Italy were found to be infected with SARS-CoV2 within less than one month
      (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30627-9/fulltext).
      Several media reports indicate that this proportion is similar across various healthcare
      institutions and countries
      (https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/world/europe/coronavirus-europe-covid-19.html) and
      (https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/spain-tightens-restrictions-week-lockdown-begins-2003
      30191539568.html).

      As the proposed study will be performed in a high-risk setting, we assumed an event (i.e. PCR
      positivity) probability of 10% in the control group and 3% in the experimental arm after the
      maximum study period. In summary, a sample size of 210 participants per arm is necessary to
      detect a HR of 0.3 with a power of 80.3% with an alpha-error of 0.05. To account for
      drop-outs and asymptomatic, undetected infection at inclusion or past infection with existing
      immunity, an additional 10 participants will randomized per treatment arm. The overall study
      population is therefore 440 participants.

      Statistical analysis will be based on two populations: A Modified Intention to Treat
      population excluding those who withdrew consent after randomization and those with a positive
      serology at baseline. And a per protocol population including all randomized subjects who
      completed at least 3 out of 4 follow-up visits and took at least 80% of all doses of study
      medication.
