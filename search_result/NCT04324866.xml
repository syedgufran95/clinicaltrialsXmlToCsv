  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has hit Northern Italy (including the Veneto region)
      particularly hard, causing several deaths and putting a huge strain on the Italian National
      Healthcare System. In the absence of specific treatments, preventing the infection from
      spreading remains the only effective measure. There is a lot of apprehension both from
      doctors (including dermatologists, rheumatologists and gastroenterologists) and their
      patients that immunosuppressive medications (biologics, methotrexate, ciclosporin and
      corticosteroids) might lead to an increased susceptibility to COVID-19 infection or
      negatively influence the course of the infection. However, there is currently a lack of
      scientific evidence to recommend whether immunosuppressive treatments should or should not be
      continued in patients who have no symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Besides, treatment
      discontinuation would cause flare-ups of diseases - such as plaque psoriasis, psoriatic
      arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases - which are invalidating and have a relatively high
      prevalence in the Veneto population. In the Unit of Dermatology of the Azienda Ospedaliera
      Universitaria Intergrata di Verona alone, more than 2000 patients are currently being treated
      with immunosuppressive agents. As of now, there are no data available on the prevalence and
      incidence of COVID-19 infection in patients with immune-mediated diseases, nor can data from
      randomized clinical trials be extrapolated to the susceptibility to COVID-19 infection in
      patients on biologic drugs. This study aims to assess the prevalence and incidence of
      COVID-19 infection in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis on immunosuppressive therapy and
      to identify associated risk factors. Such data would prove invaluable for clinicians dealing
      with patients on immunosuppressive agents during the coronavirus outbreak.
