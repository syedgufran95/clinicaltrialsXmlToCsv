      The role of CT scan of the chest in Pre-anesthetic assessment of the severity of COVID-19 and
      the correlations between CT measurements of the aortic and pulmonary arteries diameters and
      severity of pneumonia.

      Patients who were scheduled for emergency surgery during COVID-19 pandemic should have be
      screened for COVID pre-operatively given the prevalence f asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic
      cases that could be carriers to infection and possibly cause cross infection to the operating
      room staff especially the anesthetists who deal with the upper airway during intubation with
      high possibility of getting infected with SARS-COV 2 virus. Waiting respiratory tract PCR
      (RT-PCR) test for COVID can delay the surgery which may increase patients morbidity and
      mortality. RT-PCR test has limited sensitivity and specificity.

      Patients who are confirmed to have COVID-19 infection (have positive RT-PCR) or patients who
      have possible COVID-19 infection (have symptoms but were not tested with RT-PCR) will undergo
      non-enhanced CT scanning of the chest (without giving IV contrast).

      Chest CT scan will be interpreted by 2 Consultants radiologists with an experience of at
      least 10 years in their field.

      The radiologists are going to be requested to comment on the lung parenchyma, describing the
      findings , assess the pulmonary artery, aorta diameters and the aorta:pulmonary diameters
      ratio will be then calculated. The degree of pneumonia severity index will then be described
      as well.

      The radiologists will be blinded to the aim of the study.

      All data will be collected and then correlation between the data sets will be statistically
      tested.
