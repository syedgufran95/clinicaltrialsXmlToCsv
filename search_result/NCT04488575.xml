  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study to assess the safety and efficacy of
      EDP1815 in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection.

      The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of EDP1815 at reducing time to resolution of
      symptoms, preventing progression of COVID-19 symptoms and preventing COVID-Related
      Complications (CRC)
