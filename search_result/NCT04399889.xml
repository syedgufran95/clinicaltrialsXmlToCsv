  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 30 patient, Phase 1/2a multi-center pilot study to test the safety and to describe
      the preliminary efficacy of intravenous administration of allogenic human cord tissue
      mesenchymal stromal cells (hCT-MSC) as an investigational agent, under U.S. IND 19968 to
      patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 infection
      (COVID-ARDS). The key secondary endpoints are 28 day survival, an increase in PaO2/FiO2 ratio
      by 50% at 96 hours, days to hospital discharge to home or rehab, and number of days requiring
      mechanical ventilation.

      Patients will be eligible for treatment with 3 daily consecutive doses of hCT-MSC at 1
      million cells/kg (max dose 100 million cells), 18-30 hours apart, if they have a confirmed
      diagnosis of COVID-19 and meet clinical and radiographic criteria for ARDS.

      Results from the first 10 patients will be compared with concurrent outcomes utilizing
      standard of care treatments in participating hospitals and in published reports in the
      medical literature. Results from the additional 20 patients will be combined with the first
      10 and analyzed. The trial is relying on focused eligibility of the participants (patients
      with ARDS), single cohort with short trial time (4 weeks), and simple assessment of clinical
      outcome (survival, improvement of ARDS). This is a sequential design in the sense that after
      the first 10 patients are evaluated a decision will be made by the PIs and the Data Safety
      Monitoring Board whether to proceed with the exploratory randomized portion of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient or legally authorized representative (LAR) must have the ability to
             understand and the willingness to provide a signed and dated informed consent form.

          2. Age 18 years and over

          3. The patient agrees to use adequate contraception for the duration of the treatment
             protocol and for 6 months post treatment.

          4. Positive RT- PCR testing for COVID-19 nucleic acid using nasopharyngeal swabbing or
             any other site

          5. Patient meets ARDS criteria as defined by Berlin criteria, and is on mechanical
             ventilation a. Berlin criteria for ARDS are: i. bilateral opacities on chest imaging
             consistent with pulmonary edema ii. A need for positive pressure ventilation via
             endotracheal or tracheostomy tube iii. PaO2/FiO2 ratio ≤ 300mmHg with a minimum of 5
             cmH20 PEEP iv. Infiltrates not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload in
             the physician's best clinical judgement ARDS onset is considered the time that the
             last of criteria 1-4 is met. Infiltrates considered &quot;consistent with pulmonary edema&quot;
             include any infiltrate not due to mass, atelectasis, or effusion, or opacities known
             to be chronic (greater than 1 week old). Vascular redistribution or indistinct vessels
             or heart border alone do not qualify as opacities.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of multiorgan failure involving one or more organs, excluding the lungs as
             defined below:

               1. Presence of shock, defined as MAP &lt; 65 mmHg with signs of peripheral
                  hypoperfusion, or continuous infusion of 2 or more vasopressor or inotrope agents
                  to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg.

               2. Serum bilirubin &gt; 10 mg/dl

               3. Platelet count &lt; 50,000/ml

          2. Evidence of acquired or congenital immunodeficiency (due to immunosuppressive therapy,
             HIV, previous treatment for cancer, etc.)

          3. History of metastatic cancer in the past 3 years

          4. History of previous treatments with MSCs or other cell therapies

          5. Patient is co-enrolled in any other IND-sponsored clinical trials for COVID-19

          6. Evidence of pregnancy or lactation

          7. Moribund patient not expected to survive &gt; 24 hours

          8. Unable/unwilling to deliver lung protective ventilation

          9. Patient is receiving Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO)
