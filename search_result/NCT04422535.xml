  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 disease and its treatment on
      ventricular repolarization, assessed by measuring the QTc interval, in patients admitted to
      the critical care unit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus infection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome COVID-2 is characterized by a
      broad clinical spectrum ranging from asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory tract
      disease and severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and even death, with many
      patients hospitalized with pneumonia. In addition, the infection can have a direct impact on
      cardiovascular disease including the development of arrhythmias, although the exact incidence
      is not known. Treatments administered for COVID-19 infection have the potential to produce
      adverse cardiovascular effects including prolongation of the QT interval and development of
      arrhythmias.

      Relevant clinical data that may affect the QT interval and specifically the medication the
      patient has received will be recorded. The specific treatment administered for COVID-19 will
      be recorded as the concomitant medication of the critical patient that may have an impact on
      the QT interval. Analytical data will also be collected on plasma levels of ions such as
      potassium, calcium and magnesium, blood gases, renal and hepatic function parameters and
      cardiac markers.

    <measure>Assessing the QT and QTc interval in patients admitted to intensive care units for COVID-19 infection</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The QT interval measurement will be performed on the available 12-lead ECG from the medical record. The QT interval will be measured according to the recommendations of the scientific societies of cardiology: it is considered from the beginning of the activation of the ventricular myocardium and the end of its repolarization, which are represented in the ECG respectively by the beginning of the QRS and the end of the T wave. Ideally, the QT interval should be measured in Q-wave leads in DII and V5. An average value of 3 heart cycles (beats) should be recorded. Two researchers to control inter-observer variability will perform the measurement.</description>
