  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is an infection linked to a new coronavirus: SARS-CoV-2, which appeared in Wuhan in
      China at the end of 2019, and which has since spread around the world, responsible for a new
      major pandemic, which is upsetting the whole world.

      If severe respiratory disease is the form that constitutes the extreme gravity of the disease
      (mortality, with more than 170,000 deaths worldwide to date).

      However, there is a great heterogeneity of clinical forms with asymptomatic or symptomatic
      pauci forms, moderate forms, up to severe forms.

      Different symptoms may appear: fever, cough, asthenia, dyspnea, gastrointestinal forms,
      anosmia and / or ageusia, skin involvement, etc.

      Given the novelty of this infection, several questions remain:

        -  What are all the symptoms that can be contracted by a COVID-19 patient?

        -  Are there clinical forms not described?

        -  What is the evolutionary profile, the healing time of this disease in patients treated
           on an outpatient basis?

        -  What are the factors associated with a prolonged form of COVID-19 disease, including on
           an outpatient basis?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most of the descriptive studies relating to COVID-19 relate to the severe forms of the
      disease managed in the hospital sector.

      Few data have been published on moderate forms, requiring no hospitalization, of strict
      outpatient management.

      These so-called moderate forms, however, constitute the majority of cases of COVID-19
      (approximately 80%).

      In the Infectious and Tropical Diseases Department of Pitie Salpetriere, COVIDOM pilot site,
      at the beginning of March, during the intensification of the epidemic in France, a weekly
      telephone consultation was set up to take care of people tested for COVID + by PCR, or people
      not tested by PCR, or even tested with negative PCR but symptomatic and followed at home,
      suffering from moderate form of COVID-19, as well as their contact cases if they wished.

      Telemedicine is particularly suitable in this epidemic context, ensuring continuity of care,
      while limiting face-to-face consultations, thus reducing the risk of cross-contamination.

      Given the novelty of this infection, it is important to be able to best characterize these
      ambulatory forms, as well as their evolution, in order to manage these patients, and to offer
      primary care physicians a more detailed description of these forms. , which they are and will
      be called upon to take care of, general medicine being central to dealing with the epidemic.

        Enrolment will be done from the active queue of patients included in the COVIDOM / PSL
        platform.

        This study will be a monocentric data collection. The patient is called, on working days,
        weekly from D0 to D30, and beyond if the symptoms persist on D30.

        Data will be collected at D0, D7, D14, D21 and D30. The visit on D30 corresponds to the end
        of the systematic weekly telephone interviews if the patient has reached complete recovery,
        defined by the absence of symptoms for 3 days.

        If the symptoms persist on D30: monitoring is continued, on D45 and D60, and beyond if
        necessary.
