      Introduction: The SARS-Cov-2 outbreak in France and the concomitant massive increase in the
      number of cases requiring hospital management create a major risk of COVID-19 infection for
      hospital staff. In addition to nosocomial transmission, the health care workers (HCWs),
      defined as persons serving in health care settings who have the potential for direct or
      indirect exposure to patients or infectious materials, are also exposed to community
      transmission. Whether HCWs acquire infection at work or in the community is important to
      adapt protection measures. A few studies investigated COVID-19 infection among medical and
      nursing personnel. However, none have analyzed all categories of hospital staff. As of April
      9, 2020, a total of 9,282 US HCWs with confirmed COVID-19 had been reported to CDC (US),
      however description of occupational activities was not available. Therefore, limited
      information is available about COVID-19 infection among HCWs.

      Thus, the objectives of the sdudy are to estimate the incidence of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2
      infection in HCWs in five university hospitals (including geriatric hospitals) of the great
      Paris area and to estimate both nosocomial and community risk factors.

      Method: A prospective and retrospective cohort study that includes all hospital staff
      (including medical and nursing personnel, health care managers, laboratory, radiology,
      reception staffs, stretcher-bearers, etc.) working in different departments of five
      university hospitals (acute medical centers and geriatric hospitals) in the great Paris area
      (9 000 HCWs). Incidence of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection will be estimated with its 95%CI.
      Individual and contextual risk factors will be analyzed using multilevel multivariate
      logistic regression modelling to account for clustering and confounding.

      Conclusion This study should make it possible to better characterize SARS-Cov-2 contamination
      of HCWs and to estimate the share of nosocomial transmission.

      Details for &quot;Study design&quot; section

      Time perspective : Retrospective and prospective cohort study.

      Data from healthcare workers with COVID+ diagnostic at the time of inclusion will only be
      collected retrospectively. In contrast, data from healthcare workers free from infection will
      be collected prospectively.
