      Study objectives

        1. To identify the incidence of upper respiratory tract symptoms: fever, cough and
           breathing difficulties, other symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection, respiratory
           tract infections suggestive of COVID-19, and COVID-19 confirmed by laboratory testing
           among the UK MS population

        2. To establish if some DMDs increase the risk of COVID-19 infection

        3. To determine the incidence and effectiveness of self-isolation in the MS population. To
           examine the impact self-isolation has on mood, fatigue, and other routinely collected
           patient reported outcome measures from the MS Register.

        4. To determine the clinical outcome of respiratory tract infections, including confirmed
           and suspected cases of COVID-19, in terms of symptoms, time to recovery, hospital
           admission, requirement for ventilation, and death.

        5. To determine the longer-term impact of COVID-19 on MS, using routinely collected MS
           outcomes in the MS register, including impact on disability, relapses and changes in
           DMDs as assessed at 3 monthly intervals.

        6. To determine where people are obtaining their health information during the COVID-19
           outbreak.

        7. To establish changes in DMDs prior to and as a result of symptoms related and unrelated
           to COVID-19

        PwMS in the UK who self report as having MS, or have been recruited at a clinical site.

        Given the potentially vulnerable nature of pwMS due to active drug treatment and their
        potential susceptibility to infection it is important to chart this population within the
        MS Register
