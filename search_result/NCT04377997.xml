  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic caused by the severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused considerable morbidity and
      mortality in over 170 countries. Increasing age and burden of cardiovascular comorbidities
      are associated with a worse prognosis among patients with COVID-19. In addition, serologic
      markers of more severe disease including coagulation abnormalities and thrombocytopenia, are
      not uncommon among patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 infection and are more common
      in patients who died in-hospital. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to grow, there is a
      pressing need to identify safe, effective, and widely available therapies that can be scaled
      and rapidly incorporated into clinical practice. Understanding the putative mechanism of
      increased mortality risk associated with abnormal coagulation function and cardiac injury is
      critical to guide studies of promising therapeutic interventions. Published and anecdotal
      reports indicate that endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis are common in critically ill
      patients with COVID-19, including reports of diffuse microvascular thrombosis in the lungs,
      heart, liver, and kidneys. Patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CVD risk factors
      are known to have endothelial dysfunction and a heightened risk of thrombosis. A recent study
      of COVID-19 inpatients from Wuhan, China observed that an elevated D-dimer level greater than
      1 ug/mL was associated with an 18 times higher risk of in-hospital death, underscoring the
      importance of increased coagulation activity as a potential modifiable risk marker that may
      drive end-organ injury. Given the established link between endothelial dysfunction and
      thrombosis in patients with cardiovascular disease, and the association between coagulopathy
      and adverse outcomes in patients with sepsis, the association between increased coagulation
      activity, end-organ injury, and mortality risk may represent a modifiable risk factor among
      COVID-19 patients with critical illness. Therefore, we propose to conduct a randomized,
      open-label trial of therapeutic anticoagulation in COVID-19 patients with an elevated D-dimer
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety.

      Patients identified as eligible through discussions with the primary care team and review of
      the electronic medical record will be approached and consented as described above in &quot;Subject
      Enrollment&quot; and &quot;Procedures for obtaining consent&quot;.

      For research purposes, 20mL of blood will be drawn and stored for biobanking at the following
      timepoints: at baseline (i.e., after enrollment and before randomization), 5-7 days
      post-randomization, and on the day of discharge.

      After enrollment and blood collection, patients will then be randomized to therapeutic
      anticoagulation (LMWH for most subjects but UFH for those with morbid obesity or moderate to
      severe renal dysfunction as noted below) or standard of care.

      Based on the MGH COVID-19 Treatment Guidance document, the risk stratification recommends
      daily complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), creatine kinase (CPK),
      ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). In addition,
      PT, PTT, fibrinogen, and D-dimer are recommended to be checked every other day if in the ICU
      or daily if elevated. Given that by virtue of the inclusion criteria of our study (i.e., a
      D-dimer &gt;1ug/mL), all of our patients will be within Category 3 and all of the above markers
      will be obtained for clinical purposes and thus will also be documented for research
      purposes. For clinical risk stratification, LDH is to be checked daily if elevated and
      troponin to be checked q2-3d if elevated. If clinically indicated, procalcitonin will be
      measured and IL-6 obtained in patients in Category 2 or 3 disease severity. If measured for
      clinical purposes, LDH, troponin, procalcitonin, and IL-6 will be recorded for research
      purposes.
