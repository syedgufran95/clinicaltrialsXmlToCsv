    <textblock>
      During the last couple of years, a growing number of wearable devices evolved to provide
      accurate, cheap and non-invasive monitoring of vitals parameters.This connected care
      technology could be helpful for treatment and care during a pandemic such as COVID-19. The
      use of these non-invasive remote monitoring devices can help health care providers to assess
      patient's vital signs and symptom progression, reducing reducing patient and healthcare
      provider contact and exposure to COVID-19 during this pandemic.

    <textblock>
      Several cuff-less blood pressure monitoring devices have emerged in patient care using
      photoplethysmography. PPG utilizes an infrared or visible light to measure peripheral
      volumetric variations of blood circulation and its waveform has been proven to have a good
      correlation with BP waveform.Nonetheless, the accuracy of these instruments is of fundamental
      importance.

      Several validation procedures for assessing the precision of BP monitoring devices have been
      developed, including protocols by the Association for the Advancement of Medical
      Instrumentation, International Organization for Standardization and European Society of
      Hypertension. Adherence to these guidelines are essential to ensure the effectiveness of BP
      measurement of the wearable devices.

      Therefore, the investigators propose to test wearable low-noise, low-power SENBIOSYS
      photoplethysmography signals for estimation of BP.

    <description>The primary outcome is the assessment of mean bias (± 95% CI or precision of bias) for systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and mean blood pressure (MBP) between invasive and non-invasive BP measurements. The standard deviation of the bias (±95% limits of agreement), will be assessed for SBP, DBP, and MBP measurements.</description>

    <description>Immediately after coronary angiography, intra-arterial BP waveforms will be recorded using a fluid-filled catheter via right femoral or radial access. The catheter will be flushed before any waveform recordings is made. At first, the catheter will be positioned in the aorta for 3 minutes of stable BP waveforms recording. Intracoronary nitroglycerin will be administered at a dose of 300 µg, newly preceding 3 minute of recording. At the end of the coronary angiography, additional 3 minutes of recording will be performed in the aorta.</description>

    <description>Invasive BP monitoring is a commonly used technique in the ICU and is used to guide many intensive care unit therapies. Enrolled patients must have had an arterial catheter in place at the time of inclusion to the study. Arterial catheterization will be performed by the intensive care team according to current medical guidelines. No arterial catheters were placed for the sole purpose of this study. The Senbiosys device will be placed on the opposite arm of the arterial catheter for simultaneous measurements.</description>
