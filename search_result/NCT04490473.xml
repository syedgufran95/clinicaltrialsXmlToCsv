      The coronavirus outbreak has adversely affected individuals in the community, as in the rest
      of the world. However, in order to carry out this epidemic period in a healthy and conscious
      manner, determining the anxiety levels of individuals in the society and supporting them
      psychologically is of great importance. In order to achieve this, healthcare professionals
      working clinically or academically have important duties. This study was planned to test its
      validity and reliability in order to adapt the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale to Turkish.

      Coronaviruses can be seen in animals and humans as infections that can be mild and severe in
      society. The SARS-CoV-2 virus, a type of coronavirus, started in China in December 2019 and
      has spread worldwide as of January 2020. The absence of vaccine and treatment for SARS-CoV-2
      disease threatens health worldwide and significantly affects people's daily routine. In
      China, where the pandemic started, shopping malls and schools were closed for a while, and
      city entrances and exits were stopped for a while. Although there are similar practices in
      excellence, as in many countries, measures such as curfew, nursery and school closure
      continue to be taken for under-20s and over-65s. . The coronavirus epidemic that affects our
      entire life is not fully known about the disease process, WHO is defined as the pandemic of
      the epidemic, the nearest contact is the greatest risk of transmission, and the loss of many
      lives during this process affects all individuals in the society negatively and increases the
      level of anxiety .

      It is a psychological reaction involving many emotions such as anxiety, stress, or anxiety,
      fear and distress that arise in a situation that threatens the safety of the individual.
      Conditions such as uncertainty, various diseases (cancer, epidemic, etc.) and losing a
      relative can cause anxiety. Outbreaks that occur suddenly and are at risk of death are among
      these reasons.
