      Covid-19 pandemic now affects more than two million people worldwide. The neurotropism of the
      virus is assumed by its frequent association with neurological symptoms (anosmia, ageusia,
      headaches) but the extent of the central or peripheral nervous system involvement and the
      associated symptomatology remain poorly known for now. The main objective of this study is to
      describe the neurological and psychiatric manifestations occurring in the context of Covid-19
      infection in patients hospitalized or followed-up in the APHP.SU hospital group. A better
      understanding of the neuropsychiatric impairment related to Covid-19 would improve the
      management of these patients in the acute phase, and knowledge of subsequent complications
      would allow adapting their rehabilitation and follow-up. The precise phenomenological
      description of these manifestations and the imaging, biology and neuropathology data will be
      compiled from the data collected by the physicians in charge of these patients as part of
      their inpatient or outpatient care. This study will also allow collecting unusual clinical
      manifestations from patients followed for neurological or psychiatric pathology in hospital
      departments and presenting a Covid-19 infection, in order to optimize the reorganization of
      their management, follow-up and rehabilitation in the epidemic context.

      Pandemic context In December 2019, the first cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection
      (Covid-19) appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The virus quickly spread to other
      Chinese provinces and then to the rest of the world. The first cases in France were diagnosed
      on 23 January 2020 in patients who had been in China, and the number of cases rapidly
      increased to 100 confirmed cases on 29 February 2020. As of 16 April, 106,206 patients had
      been confirmed, 6,457 patients were hospitalized in intensive care units, and the number of
      deaths linked to Covid-19 in hospital was 10,643 (government.fr). At the same date, more than
      2,065,906 cases were confirmed worldwide, with more than 137,124 deaths (jhu.edu). The most
      commonly reported clinical manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection is an infectious syndrome
      associated with respiratory signs.

      Neurological and psychiatric manifestations of Covid-19 To date, little is known about
      neurological and psychiatric manifestations of Covid-19. Some authors suggested a significant
      proportion of patients with central neurological manifestations such as headache, confusion,
      seizures or strokes. Some cases of COVID-19 encephalitis have also been reported: a case of
      acute haemorrhagic encephalitis, and a case of encephalitis with seizure and positive
      SARS-CoV-2 PCR in the CSF. Neurological impairment of Covid-19 has been proposed as a
      contributing mechanism to respiratory failure in some patients with severe disease. Anosmia
      and ageusia are now recognized as common symptoms of the infection. Cases of Guillain-Barré
      syndrome and probable myelitis (without radiological confirmation) have also been described.
      Myalgia is frequently reported in patients with Covid-19 infection, but no cases of
      documented myopathy have been reported to date.

      Patients with Covid-19 infection may also present systemic encephalopathy in the context of
      severe respiratory failure, associated organ failure (renal, hepatic), and iatrogenicity.

      Patients hospitalized in intensive care unit for severe forms of the infection frequently
      present with confusion, and sometimes persistent cognitive disorders such as a dysexecutive
      syndrome, attention disorders, spatio-temporal disorientation. A high frequency of clinical
      signs of cortico-spinal bundle damage and leptomeningeal contrast images on cerebral MRI has
      also been reported.

      Regarding psychiatric manifestations, a high prevalence of anxiety disorders and depressive
      syndromes was noted in patients with Covid-19. Post-traumatic stress disorder may also occur
      in these patients, particularly those who have suffered from severe forms of stress and have
      been hospitalized in intensive care units.

      SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the coronavirus family and bears a strong similarity to other
      coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. Clinical and preclinical knowledge of other
      coronaviruses suggests neurotropism of viruses of this family. In particular, infection with
      SARS-CoV-2 or NCoV-OC43 may cause encephalitis or encephalomyelitis. The SARS-CoV-2 virus
      adheres to cell membranes by interaction with ACE2 receptors, which are highly expressed on
      the surfaces of neurons and glial cells. The ACE2 receptor is particularly expressed in the
      brainstem and in regions involved in cardiovascular control including the paraventricular
      nucleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract. The virus could reach the nervous system via
      systemic circulation (viremia) or via ethmoidal microcirculation via the olfactory
      epithelium. Indeed, animal studies have shown that SARS-Cov can invade the brain via the
      olfactory epithelium via the nasal route and cause neuronal death. The virus could also
      infect the brain through trans-synaptic transmission from the olfactory epithelium through
      the ethmoidal floor to the olfactory bulb. Another mechanism of neurological damage related
      to Covid-19 infection could be the initiation of an immune reaction with the release of
      cytokines and other inflammatory proteins, leading to a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier,
      which amplifies neuro-inflammatory processes. Systemic inflammation and cytokines may also
      promote ischemic stroke. Severe coagulopathies have been reported.

      Covid-19 and pre-existing neurological and psychiatric disorders SARS-CoV-2 infection could
      lead to the aggravation of certain pre-existing neurological and psychiatric disorders, but
      the potential impact of the infection in the short, medium and long term on these pathologies
      is still unknown.

      Indeed, infections are a classic aggravating factor in many neurological pathologies, such as
      autoimmune pathologies, metabolic pathologies, and also neurodegenerative pathologies. Brain
      inflammation is recognised as an important mechanism of neurodegenerative pathologies and has
      also been implicated in psychiatric pathologies such as schizophrenia and depression.

      Patients with cardiac or respiratory damage, particularly in the context of neuro-muscular
      pathologies, could particularly develop severe forms of infection. Patients with
      neurodegenerative pathologies often represent an elderly population, and therefore also at
      risk of severe forms of infection. Patients followed for inflammatory or neuro-oncological
      pathologies and undergoing immunosuppressive treatments or chemotherapy also represent a
      at-risk population. SARS-CoV-2 infection could also worsen certain psychiatric pathologies.

      Public interest research Neurological and psychiatric manifestations have been reported in
      patients with Covid-19 but the different neuropsychiatric expressions of Covid-19 infections
      are currently not well characterized.

      A better understanding of the neurological and psychiatric impairment related to Covid-19
      could improve management of the patients in the acute phase.

      Knowledge of neurological and psychiatric complications subsequently occurring would allow
      adapting the follow-up of these patients. The inclusion of prospective long-term follow-up
      data is crucial in the overall understanding of the neuropsychiatric disorders of Covid-19.
      Neurological complications are likely to occur at a distance from the infection or to be
      lately diagnosed, for instance, in patients who have been in intensive care. The collection
      of data from the rehabilitation follow-up of these patients is crucial in this context.

      The precise phenomenological description of these manifestations and the collection of
      imaging, biological and neuropathological data may also allow establishing hypotheses on the
      pathophysiology of the neurological damage caused by Covid-19.

      The impact of Covid-19 infection on pre-existing neurological and psychiatric pathologies is
      not known. This knowledge would optimize the reorganization of the management, follow-up and
      rehabilitation of these patients in the epidemic context.

      In this observational, retrospective, multicentre study, the investigators aim at i)
      describing the clinical and paraclinical manifestations of patients with neurological or
      psychiatric manifestations of Covid-19 infection, and ii) describing changes in the clinical
      trajectories of patients with Covid-19 infection, initially followed for neurological or
      psychiatric pathologies.
