    <textblock>
      A better understanding of the different phenotypes of COVID 19 in patients with inflammatory
      rheumatisms, and the persitence of antibodies against SARS CoV-2 in these patients under
      immunosuppressive drugs are required to propose appropriated recommendations for these
      patients in order to guide the strategy of vaccination in this immune-depressed population
      who is not immunized.

      In this multicentric epidemiological study, 3 workpackages (WPs) are proposed. For the first
      one, 5 000 patients with rheumatoid arthritis or spondyloarthritis using serological tests
      will be screened to determine the percentage of seroconverted patients with inflammatory
      rheumatisms (WP1). Different forms of COVID19 in patients with a positive serology will be
      studied, compared to a group of seronegative patients (WP1), as well as the impact of COVID19
      epidemic on the psychological aspect (WP1). The follow-up the persistence of SARS-CoV-2
      serological status for 2 years in 200 patients with inflammatory rheumatisms compared to
      matched healthy controls to evaluate the impact of immuno-suppressive drugs (WP2) will be
      proposed, as well as the study of the prevalence of thrombo-embolic events and different
      biological factors implicated in coagulation (WP3). 5000 patients with rheumatoid arthritis
      and spondyloarthritis will be recruited in 16 departments of rheumatology and screened for
      SARS-CoV-2 with a validated serological test. 200 patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 serology
      will be followed-up at 6, 12 and 24 months. Demographic data, informations on the rheumatic
      disease and the COVID-19, self-questionnaires evaluating psychological impact and blood test
      to evaluated serological status on SARS-CoV-2 and to dose coagulation factors will be
      performed at every visit
