  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019. This
      new coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan, China in late December 2019. According to WHO,
      the incidence rate of COVID-19 is prominent among adults and elderly people, reaching so far
      &gt;2 million cases globally. Meanwhile, confirmed death cases reached &gt;126 thousands of
      reported cases in 185 countries and still increasing. We anticipate that immunological
      differences among COVID19-infected patients might be a reason behind the variation of patient
      outcomes. Therefore, we intend to investigate cellular and humoral immune responses of
      COVID19-positive patients, and we claim to discover new indicators of patients' prognosis.
      Our target population includes three categories of patients staying at ICU, HMC
      (COVID19-positive vs. COVID19-negative vs. healthy control). Throughout their ICU stay,
      multiple blood samples will be screened for leukocytes surface markers, leukocytes'
      production of certain molecules, and circulating cytokines/chemokines/checkpoint inhibitors.
      Their plasma/serum will be used as well for immune proteomics, metabolomics, and other
      serological tests. Such parameters can provide the more comprehensive status of
      COVID19-infected patients at infection onset, during treatment intake, and at recovery or
      relapse stage. Following analysis, the main prospective outcome of this study is to identify
      the most reflective markers of COVID19-positive patients' outcomes.
