  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rapid spread of COVID-19 is expected to have a significant impact on medicine as well as
      all sectors worldwide. In particular, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic immune
      disease in which remission and activation are repeated and must be treated consistently
      throughout life. In addition, patients with IBD may be vulnerable to various infectious
      diseases due to the immuno-compromised state due to the use of immuno-suppressants or
      biological agents. During a pandemic, patients with IBD may postpone hospital visits due to
      concerns about infection with COVID-19, and if they cannot continue drug treatment, there is
      a concern about the flare up IBD disease activity. Therefore, in this study, we would like to
      investigate the current status of hospital utilization of IBD patients in Daegu, the epidemic
      area of COVID-19, and to investigate the effect of patient perception of COVID-19 on hospital
      ultilization.

      Background: In the epidemic area of COVID-19, emergency treatment of chronic diseases other
      than COVID-19 can be limited. Therefore, it is important to reduce the risk of exposure to
      COVID-19 in patients with chronic immune diseases such as IBD, but it is most important to
      manage well so that the underlying diseases are not exacerbated at times when emergency
      medical treatment may be difficult. However, there is a lack of evidence on the management
      policy of chronic immune diseases in the current epidemic, and only expert opinions are being
      presented.

      Aim: To investigate the current status of hospital utilization of IBD patients in Daegu, the
      epidemic area of COVID-19, and to investigate the effect of patient perception of COVID-19 on
      hospital utilization.

      Material and method: This study is a multicenter, prospective, cross-sectional survey which
      will be consulted in Keimyung University Dongsan Medical Center and Yeungnam University
      Hospital. Patients with IBD aged above 18 will enrolled and surveyed about their perception
      about COVID-19 and status of hospital utilization during pandemic period. Patients'
      demographics and disease-related variables will be evaluated to identify clinical
      significances.
