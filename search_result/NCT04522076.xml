  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus-2019 disease (COVID-19) and community-acquired pneumonia are significant problems
      of modern medicine. Pneumonia is the most common severe complication of COVID-19. But at the
      same time, COVID-19 is not the only cause of community-acquired pneumonia. Moreover,
      pneumonia is only one of the numerous possible severe complications of COVID-19. Medical
      centers specialized for the hospital treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 and
      community-acquired pneumonia were organized in different regions of Russia during coronavirus
      pandemic-2020. The indications for hospitalization to one of these centers based in the
      National Medical and Surgical Center (NMSC) are: confirmed or suspected severe COVID-19 or
      community-acquired pneumonia.

      A prospective medical registry of such patients hospitalized to NMSC, is intended to analyze
      and compare their clinical and instrumental data, co-morbidity, treatment, short-term and
      long-term outcomes in real clinical practice.

      Stage 1. Hospital treatment in NMSC

      Duration of this stage: from the date of admission to the hospital up to the date of
      discharge from the hospital / or up to the date of death during the reference
      hospitalization. The date of admission to the hospital will be the date of enrollment to the
      study.

      Evaluation of electronic health record data using the Medical Information System (MIS).
      Assessment of the outcomes of the hospital phase (discharge from the hospital, death) and
      significant events (acute respiratory and pulmonary failure, requiring mechanical
      ventilation; cardiovascular events - myocardial infarction, cerebral stroke, acute heart
      failure, paroxysmal heart rhythm disturbances, bleedings, thrombosis of large vessels and
      thromboembolic complications). A survey of patients to clarify data on risk factors, somatic
      diseases, and drug therapy before hospitalization.

      COVID-19 was diagnosed when severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
      infection was confirmed by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Pneumonia was confirmed according
      to computerized tomography (CT) data.

      Stage 2. Prospective outpatient follow-up for 24 months

      Duration of this stage: 24 months after discharge from the hospital This work will be
      delivered by investigators from the National Medical Research Center for Therapy and
      Preventive Medicine.

      Evaluation of long-term outcomes and events among residents of Moscow and the Moscow Region
      according to a patient survey (contact by phone for 30-60 days, 6 months, 12 and 24 months
      after discharge from the hospital) and medical records.
