  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, dose-escalating study to evaluate the safety and explore
      the dose limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of a human umbilical cord derived
      mesenchymal stem cell product (BX-U001) in severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients with acute
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Qualified subjects after the screening will be divided
      into low, medium, or high dose groups to receive a single intravenous infusion of BX-U001 at
      the dose of 0.5×10^6, 1.0×10^6, or 1.5×10^6 cells/kg of body weight, respectively.
