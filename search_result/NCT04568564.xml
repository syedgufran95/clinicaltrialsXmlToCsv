      In this study, providing access to physiotherapy applications by telerehabilitation method
      and the effectiveness of this application will be examined for patients who have undergone
      lung surgery in the early postoperative period during the pandemic process in which social

      -  Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and agree to participate in the study will be
           included in the study.

        -  Patients diagnosed with lung cancer and underwent thoracotomy will be randomly divided
           into Telerehabilitation Group (TGR) and Control (KG) groups.

        -  Before the operation, enlightened and signed consent will be obtained from the cases,
           the first evaluations of the patients in both groups will be made and the first exercise
           training will be given to the telerehabilitation group.

        -  The study group will be followed up every day during their hospitalizations and the
           final tests of both groups will be made before discharge. Long-term follow-up will be
           carried out in the 1st month and 3rd month after discharge.

    <measure>The six-minute walking test</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The six-minute walking test is an example of timed distance testing, widely used in clinical research and rehabilitation studies. According to the guidelines published by the American Thoracic Society, 6MWT is an easy-to-use, better tolerated test that reflects daily activities better than other walking tests. It can be applied in a short time. Requires little equipment. The six-minute walk test, used as a field test, is a simple and inexpensive test compatible with daily activities, which does not require exercise equipment. Before starting the test, the patient should rest for at least 10 minutes by sitting in the chair near the starting point. The walking area must be at least 30 m long. A shorter corridor causes more time to be spent for more frequent turns and changes of direction. With the help of stopwatch, it is kept for 6 minutes and the number of laps during the period is calculated and recorded. The functional capacity of the cases will be evaluated with 6MWT.</description>

The highest score is 80, the lowest is 20. Total anxiety the higher the score, the more anxiety level of the person filling the scale.</description>
