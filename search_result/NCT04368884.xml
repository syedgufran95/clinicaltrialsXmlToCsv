  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large number of Health Care Workers (HCWs) would be potentially getting exposed to COVID19.
      Some of them would be asymptomatic or may get subclinical symptoms. Our HCW would have higher
      exposure and possibly higher seroconversion either symptomatic or with clinical symptoms than
      the general population. This study is aimed to understand the rate of seroconversion states
      at different stages of exposure. It is crucial to collect baseline immune status and the
      early immunological changes that might occur in asymptomatic or symptomatic health care
      workers and to compare that with the suspected or confirmed cases by following them for six
      weeks.

      This prospective observational, longitudinal study is being conducted at Max Super Specialty
      Hospital, Saket, New Delhi. Below mentioned are the study objectives-

      Primary Objectives

        -  To determine the extent of infection in the healthcare workers (HCW) of a tertiary care
           hospital in India, by determining the seropositivity

        -  To compare immune changes that might occur in healthcare workers who are asymptomatic or
           symptomatic with the proven positive cases in OPD or IPD at Max hospital.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To determine the fraction of asymptomatic or subclinical infections

        -  To understand the seroconversion status at different stages of exposure to front line
           HCW

      The study population would include all employees of Max Hospitals, Delhi-NCR, who have been
      tested for COVID-19. Samples and data of the COVID positive patients admitted in the hospital
      will also be collected and OPD patients coming to the hospital for COVID-19 testing will be
      one of the study subsets.
