  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This epidemiological, transversal, cohort study aims to determine the potential influence of
      an active long-term hydroxychloroquine intake over the prevalence of a history of symptoms
      evocative of a COVID-19 infection in patients with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus,
      rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome or psoriatic arthritis, during the epidemic period
      in France. The information is gathered using a standardized questionnaire, by phone call.

    <description>2 questionnaires : at inclusion and 4 months later. The exposure to hydroxychloroquine and the history of autoimmune disease is determined during the phone call along with other exposure factors. The symptoms presented by the patient are classified in &quot;Suggestive of a COVID-19 infection&quot; or &quot;Not suggestive of COVID-19 infection&quot; by a team of internists and infectious diseases specialists, by studying the questionnaires after the completion in a blind-manner regarding the hydroxychloroquine intake.</description>
