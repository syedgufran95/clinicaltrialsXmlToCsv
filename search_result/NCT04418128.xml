  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In-vitro studies revealed that nafamostat mesylate has antiviral activity against Severe
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and anti-inflammatory and
      anti-coagulation effect. However, there is no clinical studies on the efficacy of nafamostat
      in patients with COVID-19.

      This study is conducted to evaluate the clinical efficacy of nafamostate mesylate in adult
      patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  The COVID-19 epidemic expanded to the whole world since it started from the Wuhan area
           in China in Dec. 2019. The Republic of Korea experiences a sharp increase in the patient
           since 24th Feb. 2020. An analysis of more than 70,000 patients in China, about 15% of
           them cause severe pneumonia, 5% require treatment in the intensive care unit, half of
           them die of the disease.

        -  There is no proven therapeutics for COVID-19 patients yet. Currently, the treatment with
           Kaletra, Hydroxychloroquine, etc. did not show apparent effect, and there are no other
           drugs that can apply to patients who get worse even with those drugs or severe.

        -  There are research reports that defective innate immunity and accelerated activation of
           the complement cascade, caused by the SARS-CoV-2, induce rapidly progressing
           pneumonitis.

             -  Action mechanism of Nafamostat mesilate A. Show anti-viral effect by an inhibition
                serine protease, which is required for the host membrane fusion of viral envelop
                protein. In vitro experiments showed that the drug is effective in MERS-CoV,
                Influenza virus, and SARS-CoV-2.

      B. Show anti-inflammatory effect by inhibition of the complement pathway, and inhibition of
      cytokine production.

      This study is conducted to evaluate the clinical efficacy of nafamostate mesylate in adult
      patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia.
