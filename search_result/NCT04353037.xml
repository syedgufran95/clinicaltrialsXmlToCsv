  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed hypothesis is that high doses of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for at least 2 weeks
      can be effective antiviral medication both as a treatment in ambulatory patients and
      prophylaxis/treatment in health care workers because it impairs lysosomal function and
      reorganizes lipid raft (cholesterol and sphingolipid rich microdomains in the plasma
      membrane) content in cells, which are both critical determinants of Emerging Viral Disease
      (EVD) infection. This hypothesis is based on a growing literature linking chloroquine to
      antiviral activity. It is estimated that enough information exists to launch a clinical trial
      of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19.

      Sub-Study 1: COVID-19 patients in self-quarantine. Arm 1: Hydroxychloroquine 400 mg bid (two
      200 mg tablets taken twice a day; totaling 800 mg per day) for two weeks; Arm 2: Placebo 2
      pills twice a day for two weeks

      Sub-Study 2: Asymptomatic health care worker prophylaxis. Arm 1: Hydroxychloroquine 600 mg
      once a day (three 200 mg tablets taken once a day) for up to 2 months; Arm 2: Placebo 3 pills
      once a day for up to 2 months; cross-over from placebo to HCQ 600 mg once a day is allowed
      upon confirmatory diagnosis for COVID-19.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      Sub-Study 1 (Patients tested for COVID-19 who meet symptomology and age requirements for
      eligibility): Rate of hospitalization

      Sub-Study 2 (Health Care Workers): Rate of COVID-19 infection (confirmed by accepted testing
      methods) at 2 months

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES Sub-Study 1: Rate of secondary infection of co-inhabitants, adverse
      events, and negative for COVID-19 (confirmed by accepted testing methods) at 14 days

      Sub-Study 2: Number of shifts missed; rate of adverse events, and hospitalization at 2 months
