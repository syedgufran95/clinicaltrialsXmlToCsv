  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, Phase 2 study, to assess the efficacy of the treatment with
      convalescent plasma in patients with severe COVID-19 infection.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Convalescent plasma will be collected by plasmapheresis from patients fully recovered from
      COVID-19 infection and will be administered in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. The
      results will be compared with an historical matched control.

    <description>The primary endpoint of this trial is the survival on day 21. The primary endpoint, as a dichotomous composite of survival (yes/no) and no longer fulfilling criteria of severe COVID-19, will be analyzed according their classification. Specifically, categorical variables will be analyzed by means of absolute and relative frequencies, and all continuous variables will be described using arithmetic mean, standard deviation, median, quartiles. Also, geometric means, variance and 95% confidence intervals (CI), will be calculated for all pharmacokinetics parameters.</description>

    <description>Convalescent Plasma - early treatment of patients with severe COVID-19. Clinical and laboratory data of patients will be collected before initiation of the procedure, 30 minutes after the first dose, 30 minutes after the second dose and 30 minutes after the third plasma dose and then on days 1-7, 14, 21, 28, 35 from the start of treatment. In case of adverse reactions during transfusion such as acute shortness of breath, haemodynamic instability or high pre-existing and non-disease-related fever, the transfusion will be interrupted and detailed recording of the event as well as updating the Adverse Events Management Committee will be performed.
In addition to the standard assessments, the titer of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies will be measured in a sample drawn prior to plasmapheresis.
All donors will be tested for:
the titer of IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Pasteur Institute)
the titer of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Pasteur Institute)</description>
