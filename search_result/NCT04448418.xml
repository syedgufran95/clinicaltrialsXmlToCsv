  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the COVID-19 outbreak, it was necessary to remodel the healthcare offer for all
      categories of subjects in order to minimize unnecessary movements of people while maintaining
      an adequate level of assistance. This is also true for transgender people, who are
      periodically requested to come into the clinic for hormonal therapy monitoring and
      continuation. In our center telemedicine programs dedicated to users have been activated for
      the remote management of hormone therapy.

      We use a web-based survey to assess the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on trans-population
      health and to assess the specific needs of this population in this particular moment.
