  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this single-center, randomized, open-label, controlled study, the investigators will
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) in combination with
      standard care for severe 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, viral pneumonia caused by a novel beta-coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbroke in
      Wuhan, China. Part of patients rapidly progress severe acute respiratory failure with
      substantial mortality, making it imperative to develop an efficient treatment for severe
      2019-nCoV pneumonia besides the supportive care.

      Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been shown to improve the treatment effect and
      prognosis of severe infection over the past decades with its capacity of proving passive
      immunity and anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory effect. We hypothesized that IVIG therapy
      would improve the prognosis of severe and critically ill patients with 2019-nCoV.

      This single-center, randomized, open-label, controlled trial will evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of IVIG therapy in patients with severe or critically ill 2019-nCoV respiratory
      disease.
