  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared an emergency public health problem by the
      World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. Since then, several initiatives by the medical
      and scientific community have sought alternatives to treat infected individuals, as well as
      identifying risk or protective factors for the contamination and prognosis of patients. In
      this perspective, vitamin D supplementation can improve some important outcomes in critically
      ill patients, being considered a potent immunomodulatory agent. Vitamin D deficiency is a
      common outcome in critically ill patients, thus making it a modifiable risk factor with great
      potential for reducing hospital stay and intensive care and mortality. The investigators
      speculate that vitamin D supplementation could have therapeutic effects in patients with
      COVID-19.
