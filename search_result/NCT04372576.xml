  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the risk factors for development of
      ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and to identify the prognostic factors of VAP among
      Coronavirus Disease 2019 (CoViD-19) patients. We hypothesized that CoViD-19 serves as a high
      risk factor for the development of VAP and it affects clinical outcome measures negatively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus Disease 2019 (CoViD-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2) became a pandemic affecting thousands of individuals worldwide. A considerable
      proportion of CoViD-19 patients require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), although
      limited data are available on their clinical characteristics and course. The results of
      retrospective studies indicate older age, presence of comorbidies and secondary infections as
      predictors of mortality among this population. Further evaluation regarding ICU clinical
      course and predictors of mortality is needed.

      The aim of this study is to determine the risk factors for development of VAP and to identify
      the prognostic factors of VAP among CoViD-19 patients.
