  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV-2 induces over-production of inflammatory cytokines, and especially interleukin-6
      (IL-6). The apparently strong association between blood levels of inflammaory cytokines and
      SARS-CoV-2 disease severity has led clinicians to evaluate the administration of steroids or
      anti-IL-6 antagonists in severely ill patients. As of this day, biomarkers capable of
      predicting clinical disease progression in Covid-19 patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms
      have not yet been formally identified. Identifying such markers and evaluating their
      predictive value may be exploited to guide patient care management, and as such forms the
      core objective of this proposal.

      Because of strong inter-individual variations in the ability of innate immune cells to
      produce cytokines, the hypothesis the investigators formulate and intend to test is that
      innate IL-6 responsiveness varies between recently infected Covid-19 patients and could
      predict disease outcome.

      To test this hypothesis, the investigators propose to follow recently infected chronic
      haemodialysis patients with moderate Covid-19 symptoms. These patients stand a higher risk to
      progress to severe disease. The investigators plan to collect a blood sample in these
      patients using a system whereby ex vivo cytokine production is initiated in the very same
      blood collection tube without prior separation and centrifugation, thus reducing labour and
      operator bias. After incubation with or without known innate immune stimuli, the cell-free
      phase from each collection-culture tube will be assayed for IL-6 content. Associations
      between IL-6 content and disease outcome (encephalopathy, transfer to acute care or death)
      will be determined in 115 Covid-19 chronic haemodialysis patients with moderate symptoms
      followed in 9 centers.
