      The COVID-19 pandemic might be an opportunity to review and refine our practices in anti TB
      treatment. For the follow-up of selected patients, telephone consultations may be efficient
      and cost-effective. The aim of the study is to assess the efficiency and the satisfaction
      with telephone consultation for the pharmacist and the TB patient. The study was conducted in
      tertiary care hospital TB control centres patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) is the world's biggest killer among infectious diseases, claiming more than
      4000 lives each day. The unprecedented coronavirus pandemic seriously impacts people with
      pre-existing health conditions. People who have TB are usually more vulnerable to other
      infections, including the novel coronavirus, due to pre-existing lung damage. They are at a
      higher risk of developing complications from COVID-19. Certain populations are at greater
      risk of TB, because of where they live, where they work or because of other socio-economic
      factors which result in them experiencing barriers to accessing health services.
