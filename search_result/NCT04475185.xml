      The objective of our study is to carry out an evaluation of the safety and the effectiveness
      of the use of the MakAir respirator as useful supplement in situation of shortage of
      technical devices of assistance to the mechanical invasive ventilation, related to COVID-19
      through a protocol in 3 successive sequences.
