  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19's mechanism to enter the cell is initiated by its interaction with its cellular
      receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme. As a result of this union, a clathrin-mediated
      endocytosis process begins. This route is one of the therapeutic targets for which available
      drugs are being investigated in order to treat COVID-19 infection. This is one of the
      mechanisms blocked by drugs like ruxolitinib and chloroquine.

      Various drugs approved for clinical use that block the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway
      have been explored. It has been found that the best in vitro and in vivo results were
      obtained with statins, which also allowed generating a greater potent adaptive immune
      response.

      Therefore, statins and specifically simvastatin make it possible to block the entry process
      used by COVID-19, block inflammation by various mechanisms and increase the adaptive immune
      response. All of these processes are desirable in patients infected with COVID-19.

      Statins have been proposed to have beneficial effects in patients infected with MERS-COV,
      another coronavirus similar to COVID-19, but there have been no randomized studies supporting
      the use of statins in patients with COVID-19 infection.

      In this project we propose the combined use of one of these drugs, ruxolitinib with
      simvastatin, looking for a synergistic effect in the inhibition of viral entry and in the
      anti-inflammatory effect.
