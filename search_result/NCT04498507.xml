  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the first part of the SRAS-COV2 pandemic, families were not allowed to visit the
      patients in ICU. We know that families can develop &quot;Family-PICS&quot; after their relatives' ICU
      stay. The aim of the study is to study the psychosocial outcomes of families of patients who
      were admitted in ICU for COVID-19 during the pandemic. The second objective was to search for
      any differences in outcomes whether families benefited from video-conferences with the
      medical team and their relatives or not during the ICU stay.
