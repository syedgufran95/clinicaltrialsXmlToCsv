  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose escalation trial will be
      conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic characteristics of a single dose of MW33 injection at different doses given
      to healthy subjects to provide a basis for exploration of the therapeutic and preventive
      effects of MW33 against neocoronavirus in human.
