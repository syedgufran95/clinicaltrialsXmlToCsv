  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Respiratory infection with the SARS-CoV2 virus is associated with a major risk of viral
      pneumonia that can lead to respiratory distress requiring resuscitation. In the most severe
      forms, it may require mechanical ventilation or even lead to an acute respiratory distress
      syndrome with a particularly poor prognosis. The SARS-CoV2 is a single-stranded RNA virus of
      positive polarity and belongs to the beta genus of Coronaviruses. SARS-CoV2 is responsible
      for the third epidemic in less than twenty years secondary to a Coronavirus (SARS-CoV then
      MERS-CoV) and if the mortality associated with it is lower than that of previous strains,
      notably MERS-CoV, its spread is considerably big. As a result, the number of patients
      developing respiratory distress requiring invasive mechanical ventilation is high, with
      prolonged ventilation duration in these situations

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation are at risk of secondary, nosocomial, a
      hospitalization in the ICU service and can affect up to 40% of ventilated patients. The
      occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia is associated with an increase in the duration
      of mechanical ventilation and its effect on mortality remains uncertain under general
      conditions. The mechanisms underlying the occurrence of lower respiratory infection during
      invasive mechanical ventilation are numerous, depending for the most part on two distinct
      elements: the occurrence of transcolonisation, which will secondarily promote colonisation of
      the lower respiratory tract, and the modification of the competence of the immune system in
      its response to aggression by microbial agents whose pathogenicity is highly variable.

      Throughout the infection by SARS-CoV2, the theoretical risk of secondary respiratory
      infection during mechanical ventilation is important due to the intrication of three
      concomitant phenomena: direct pulmonary aggression, which will alter the functionality of
      local immunity, the &quot;cytokinic storm&quot;, responsible for the severity of the respiratory
      picture that motivated intubation and the need for mechanical ventilation leading inevitably
      to transcolonisation. Despite all of these pathophysiological arguments, very little data are
      available on the possibility of secondary low respiratory tract infection occurring during
      SARS-CoV2 infection and more generally during Coronarivus infections. even though all of
      these elements are well known and widely studied, very little data are currently available on
      the potential interaction between Coronaviruses and bacteria. The importance of this issue is
      very significant as recent observations tend to show a relative rarity of the occurrence of
      secondary lung infections during mechanical ventilation and the population of smokers,
      subject to chronic obstructive bronchitis (usually particularly susceptible to bacterial
      superinfections), does not appear to be more affected than that of non-smokers although the
      current data are very partial.

      The research is prospective, non interventional study that involves patients suffering from
      another severe form a COVID-19 infection: the nosocomial pneumonia under mechanical
      ventilation

      During the inclusion, a 4 ml citrate tube of blood in addition to the usual management
      assessment and aspiration of tracheal secretions will be performed at D1, D3 and D7. Tracheal
      aspiration is performed systematically in order to limit patient congestion and the risk of
      atelectasis.
