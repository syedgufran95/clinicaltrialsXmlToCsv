      This phase I trial investigates breathing techniques and meditation for health care workers
      during COVID-19 pandemic. Breathing techniques and medication may help manage stress and
      improve lung health. The goal of this trial is to learn if breathing techniques and
      meditation may help to reduce stress and improve lung health in health care workers during
      the COVID-19 pandemic.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To demonstrate the feasibility of a short pranayama or breathing techniques and meditation
      during Covid-19 pandemic.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the adherence to the practice assessed as at least 50% of participants
      implement the intervention for 3 or more times in a week by the end of week 1/day 7 (+ 3
      days).

      II. To determine the change in resilience, perceived stress and psychological impact from day
      0 today 28 as measured by the Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS), Perceived Stress Scale
      (PSS4), and COVID-19 Stress among health care workers questionnaire.

      III. To determine the changes in breath holding time measured weekly for 4 weeks.

      IV. To determine the differences in breath holding time between those who are adherent and
      those who are not adherent to the practice.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients view an instructional video on breathing techniques and meditation. Patients then
      perform breathing techniques over 3 minutes and meditation over 2 minutes twice daily (BID)
      for 28 days.
