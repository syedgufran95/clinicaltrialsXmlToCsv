  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most feared complication of COVID-19 infection is the occurrence of an acute respiratory
      distress syndrome (ARDS) that requires ICU admission and prolonged mechanical ventilation in
      more than 2% of the affected patients. Establishing the correct time to extubate mechanically
      ventilated patients is a crucial issue in the critical care practice. Delayed extubation has
      several consequences such as patient's mortality, health-care-related complications,
      neuropsychological adverse events. The aim of the INVICTUS study is to evaluate whether a
      CTUS-based MV weaning strategy could reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation of ARDS
      COVID-19 ICU patients by 72 hours, compared with usual medical care.

      Identifying patients at risk for postextubation distress using standard clinical criteria and
      the only available test we have, that is, the spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) remains a
      challenging issue2. A cumulative body of evidence suggest that the decision to attempt
      extubation might be assisted by the use of thoracic ultrasound. This non-invasive,
      reproducible and fully bedside approach is able to provide accurate information about
      respiratory, cardiac and neuromuscular functions which are independent predictors of
      extubation outcome. Recently, we have demonstrated that a combined thoracic ultrasound (CTUS)
      strategy based on lung ultrasound, echocardiography and diaphragm ultrasonographic assessment
      data performs better than routine clinical assessment to evaluate extubation readiness in
      medical and surgical ICU patients3. CTUS appears as a unique point of care precision medicine
      prognostic and diagnostic tool for the management of patients experiencing ARDS. Based on
      those premises, we hypothesize that CTUS-based MV weaning strategy could reduce the duration
      of mechanical ventilation of ARDS COVID-19 ICU patients by 72 hours, compared with usual
      medical care. This research is a national, multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label,
      in parallel group. Patients will be randomized on 1:1 CTUS strategy group or standard
      strategy group, daily daily followed until extubation+48hours, reassessed at day 28 and at 3
      months. In CTUS strategy group, a combined CTUS examination will be performed until the day
      of patient extubation. CTUS examination will consist on a fully bedside ultrasonographic
      assessment of lung, cardiac and diaphragm functions. In standard strategy group, from the day
      of patient's inclusion and beyond every day, the clinical team in charge of patients will
      decide to perform or not an SBT following current recommendations2. These criteria are mainly
      based on clinical data and do not include any specific ultrasound assessment.
