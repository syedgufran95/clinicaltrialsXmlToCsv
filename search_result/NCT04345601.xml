  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study for patients who have respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 that have
      not gotten better. Because there is no standard treatment for this infection, patients are
      being asked to volunteer for a gene transfer research study using mesenchymal stem cells
      (MSCs).

      Stem cells are cells that do not yet have a specific function in the body. Mesenchymal stem
      cells (MSCs) are a type of stem cell that can be grown from bone marrow (the spongy tissue
      inside of bones). Stem cells can develop into other types of more mature (specific) cells,
      such as blood and muscle cells.

      The purpose of this study is to see if MSCs versus controls can help to treat respiratory
      infections caused by SARS-CoV-2.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Earlier, a healthy donor provided blood cells to generate MSCs. These cells were grown and
      frozen for later use.

      Before being treated, the patient will receive a series of standard medical tests:

        -  Physical exam and history

        -  SARS-CoV-2 test

        -  Blood tests

        -  Chest X-ray or chest CT Scan

        -  A urine pregnancy test, when applicable

      The patient will be randomly assigned to a study group. We'll use a computer to put the
      patient into study group A (study drug) or group B (control) by chance (randomized). Patients
      randomized to the control group, will receive the standard treatment for their respiratory
      infection.

      These tests are done to assess the patient's eligibility to receive the cells. On the day
      that the patient is scheduled to receive the cells they will be pre-medicated with Benadryl
      and Tylenol. The patient will then receive a single intravenous (into the vein) infusion of 2
      x 10^6 cells/kg of MSCs. The patient will be monitored closely for two hours after the
      infusion.

      The patient will receive standard medical tests when getting the infusion and afterwards. As
      part of the research study, the patient will be evaluated daily for 7 days and then weekly at
      weeks 2, 3, and 4. The evaluations that will be done at these visits include:

        -  Physical exam and history

        -  SARS-CoV-2 test

        -  Blood tests

        -  Chest X-ray or chest CT Scan

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1) 18 years or older 2) Confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection real-time reverse transcription
        polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay 3) Moderate to severe acute respiratory distress
        syndrome (ARDS), based on the degree of impairment of oxygenation as defined by the ratio
        of arterial oxygen tension to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2). Based on the Berlin
        criteria noted below.

          1. Moderate ARDS: PaO2/FiO2 100-200 mmHg, on invasive or noninvasive mechanical
             ventilation settings that include EEP ≥5 cm H2O

          2. Severe ARDS: PaO2/FiO2 ≤100 mmHg on ventilator settings that include PEEP ≥5 cm H2O

        AND

          -  Bilateral opacities present on chest radiograph or computed tomographic (CT) scan,
             that are not fully explained by pleural effusions, lung collapse, or lung nodules.

          -  Respiratory failure not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload.
