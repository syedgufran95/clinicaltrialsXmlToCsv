  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shaare-Zedek Medical Center is a tertiary academic hospital in Jerusalem, Israel. On March
      2020, a dramatic increase in the number of COVID-19 cases were diagnosed in Jerusalem.
      RedHill Biopharma, Ltd. offered opaganib under compassionate use for the treatment of
      COVID-19 patients. Eligible patients were those hospitalized with COVID-19 confirmed by a
      reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay. Patients received opaganib and
      Standard of Care. For the purpose of this study, the opaganib and Standard of Care patient
      group was compared to a group of patients that received only Standard of Care. Opaganib is an
      investigational drug under development and not approved for commercial distribution.

    <textblock>
      In this observational study, the two cohorts were assigned retrospectively. Patients either
      received opaganib and Standard of Care (SOC) or SOC only. All patients were defined by the
      treating physicians at baseline as severe COVID-19. For the control cohort, IRB approval was
      granted to collect de-identified data. Both cohorts had similar median age and similar rates
      of diabetes, hypertension and obesity.

      The two treatment groups, opaganib and SOC vs. SOC were then analyzed for their clinical
      outcomes including baseline characteristics.
