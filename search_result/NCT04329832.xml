  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare two drugs (hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin) to see if
      hydroxychloroquine is better than azithromycin in treating hospitalized patients with
      suspected or confirmed COVID-19.

    <description>Per https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/key-action/COVID-19_Treatment_Trial_Design_Master_Protocol_synopsis_Final_18022020.pdf, this scale reflects a range from uninfected to dead, where 0 is &quot;no clinical or virological evidence of infection&quot;, 1 is &quot;no limitation of activities&quot;, 2 is &quot;limitation of activities&quot;, 3 is &quot;hospitalized, no oxygen therapy&quot;, 4 is &quot;oxygen by mask or nasal prongs&quot;, 5 is &quot;non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen&quot;, 6 is &quot;intubation and mechanical ventilation&quot;, 7 is &quot;ventilation + additional organ support - pressors, RRT (renal replacement therapy), ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation)&quot;, and 8 is &quot;death&quot;.</description>

    <description>Patients in the hydroxychloroquine arm will receive hydroxychloroquine 400 mg by mouth twice daily for 1 day, then 200 mg by mouth twice daily for 4 days (dose reductions for weight &lt; 45 kg or GFR (glomerular filtration rate)&lt;50ml/min). For patients &lt; 45kg, doses will be halved. For patients with GFR&lt;50ml/min, the final dose of hydroxychloroquine will not be administered. If the patient has already received hydroxychloroquine prior to randomization (no more than 2 days), the prior doses will count toward the 5-day total.</description>

    <description>Patients in the azithromycin arm will receive azithromycin 500 mg on day 1 plus 250 mg daily on days 2-5 (may be administered intravenously per clinician preference). If the patient has already received azithromycin prior to randomization (no more than 2 days), the prior doses will count toward the 5-day total.</description>
