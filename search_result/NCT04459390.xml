    <textblock>
      COVID19 is a new emerging, rapidly disseminating disease that consuming most of resources of
      efficient healthcare systems, and several hospitals, worldwide, are currently experiencing a
      shortage of ICU beds for critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

      A risk stratification based on clinical, radiological and laboratory parameters seems
      necessary in order to better identify those patients who may need hospital and/or ICU
      admission.

      One of the most alarming clinical parameters in general is the presence comorbidities. The
      underlying diseases including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, respiratory system disease and
      cardiovascular disease, may be risk factors for severe COVID-19 patients with adverse
      outcomes compared with non-severe patients. Obesity is also a risk factor for COVID-19
      severity with increased need to mechanical ventilation.

      Chronic diseases share several features with infectious disorders, such as the
      proinflammatory state, and the attenuation of the innate immune response which may be linked
      etiologically to its pathogenesis.

      Aim of the study:to assess the impact of comorbidities in patients with diagnosis of Covid-19
      on outcome, in order to find the predictors of prolonged hospital stay, need for ICU
      admission or poor outcome

      For initial diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2, CDC recommends collecting and testing an upper
      respiratory specimen. The following are acceptable specimens:

        -  A nasopharyngeal (NP) specimen collected by a healthcare provider; or

        -  An oropharyngeal (OP) specimen collected by a healthcare provider; or

        -  Sputum specimen collected by a healthcare provider. Swab specimens should be collected
           using only swabs with a synthetic tip, and an aluminum or plastic shaft. Place swabs
           immediately into sterile tubes containing 2-3 mL of viral transport media. Store the
           samples at 2-8°C up to 72 hours. If a delay in shipping or extraction is expected, store
           samples at -70°C in accordance with CDC's protocol.
