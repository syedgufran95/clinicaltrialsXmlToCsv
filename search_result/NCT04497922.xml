  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Communication with patients on their clinical status is important in delivering care in the
      emergency department. During times of high volume or complex patients, there may be lapses in
      communicating with patients about their hospital course or plans of action. These
      miscommunications may be enhanced during the current COVID-19 pandemic as there is minimized
      in-person interaction with patients in order to conserve personal protective equipment and
      decrease the risk of disease transmission. This study utilizes a virtual white board to
      deliver updates to patients about the status of their emergency department stay.

      The ultimate goal of this study is to understand the effect of delivering timely information
      about a patient's emergency department course of their satisfaction surrounding the emergency
      department stay. The experience of patients in the emergency department has been
      significantly altered by the COVID-19 pandemic due to decreased in-person encounters, and the
      use of PPE. Delivering information about their clinical course and expected hospital course
      is more difficult now given the emphasis on less in-person interaction. In response, the
      investigators have deployed in collaboration with e-ink, a virtual e-paper white board that
      can be remotely edited to help display pertinent hospital course information to patients in
      the emergency department. The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to
      understand the effect of deploying these white boards on patient satisfaction in the
      emergency department.
