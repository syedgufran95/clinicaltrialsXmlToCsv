  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective study simulating return to school for two full days prior to the
      start of the school year in September. Volunteer students and teachers from six grade ranges
      will be recruited to participate in the study. In each grade range, there will be two classes
      that will participate, one that will be assigned to wear face masks/coverings at all times
      (experimental group/class) and the other that will not wear face masks/coverings at all times
      (control group/class). Students will be randomized to either the masking at all times
      (experimental across all grades) or no masking (control across JK-Grade 4) / masking only
      when physical distance can be maintained (control across Grade 5-Grade 12) class in their
      appropriate grade. Personal behaviours and person-to-person interactions will be recorded
      using video cameras. In addition, a safe biological indicator will be applied to the hands to
      simulate potential asymptomatic infection in a subset of students. Other students will have
      sanitizer applied so that students are blinded to who has the indicator. Cameras will be used
      to document how the indicator moves throughout the classroom.

      Grade ranges will include 1) Senior Kindergarten (children who have just completed JK or SK
      in the 2019-2020 year), 2) Grades 1-2, 3) Grades 3-4, 4) Grades 5-6, 5) Grades 7-8 and 6)
      high school. A total of 14 teachers and up to 240 students will be recruited. Final class
      sizes will be in accordance with Ministry of Education and public health guidelines.
