      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled single-center study using nebulized
      platelet lysate compared to placebo control of saline administered via handheld nebulizer 1x
      daily for eight weeks to determine effect on lung function in patients with post-COVID-19
      ARDS syndrome.

      20 patients randomized to Treatment group: Inhaled nebulized platelet lysate (PL) 1x daily
      for eight weeks 20 patients randomized to Control group: Inhaled nebulized saline, 1x daily
      for eight weeks.

      Outcomes will be measured at 4-weeks, 8-weeks, 3-months, 6- months

      Goals for this study are as follows:

        1. Investigate and compare the efficacy of autologous PL inhaled via handheld ultrasonic
           nebulizer, 2-ml once per day for 4-weeks compared to saline control (Phase 1), early
           treatment timepoint.

        2. Investigate and compare the efficacy of autologous PL inhaled via handheld ultrasonic
           nebulizer, 2-ml once per day for 8-weeks compared to saline control (Phase 1), final
           treatment timepoint.

        3. Investigate, compare, and monitor long term function and quality of life through
           6-months for treatment arm compared to control.

    <description>Approximately 520 cc of autologous venous blood (within AABB guideline limits) will be drawn and platelet lysate (PL), maximizing the patients baseline platelet levels (~2-4x baseline) will be produced in a clean room setting using the Regenexx, LLC proprietary lab protocols (PL-M) utilizing a double lysis technique. From that sample, a high growth factor lysate will be created using a double lysis technique, and a sample will be retained to quantify the protein profile of the PL via ELISA quantitative analysis. The PL will be aliquoted into 56 (n=28x2) 2-ml ampules using sterile technique which will then be frozen at -20°C. The patient will unfreeze each ampule and place it into a handheld ultrasonic nebulizer and inhale the platelet lysate following the nebulizer manufacture's protocol until the treatment is completed. The treatment will be applied once a day for 8-weeks.</description>

    <description>Approximately 520 cc of autologous venous blood (within AABB guideline limits) will be drawn and donated for research purposes to keep patient blinded to group allocation. Sterile normal saline to mimic the appearance of the platelet lysate will be aliquoted into 56 (n=28x2) 2-ml ampules using sterile technique which will then be frozen at -20°C. The patient will unfreeze each ampule and place it into a handheld ultrasonic nebulizer and inhale the sterile saline following the nebulizer manufacture's protocol until the treatment is completed.
