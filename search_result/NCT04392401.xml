  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infection with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (COVID-19) has recently been identified as a
      pandemic due to the speed and global scale of its transmission. In Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes
      region (AURA), the epidemic began in February 2020 and the number of infected people is still
      important. Between 15 and 20% of COVID-19 patients develop an acute respiratory distress
      syndrome (ARDS) leading to their hospitalization in intensive care. Their clinical
      progression can be rapidly harmful with the development of severe ARDS associated with an
      increased risk of death.

      Preliminary data on the immune response of COVID-19 patients describe the induction of a
      moderate inflammatory response and the occurrence of major progressive lymphopenia over time
      associated with potential immunosuppression. Up to 50% of secondary infections are reported
      in deceased COVID-19 patients. However, no prospective study has exhaustively described the
      kinetics of the immune response of COVID-19 patients in intensive care.

      The precise description of the immune response over time in adult patients with a proven
      infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the study of the relation between this response and
      the increased risk of organ failure (severe ARDS), death or nosocomial infection will allow
      us to better understand the pathophysiology of the immune response induced by COVID-19 in
      order to (i) identify new therapeutic strategies targeting the host response in patients in
      intensive care (ii) to develop biological markers to stratify patients for future clinical
      trials evaluating these immunoadjuvant treatments in COVID-19.
