  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overall mortality of COVID-19 is variable and has been reported to be between less than 1%
      and 7%. Many authors around the world also reported data on hospitalization rate, need for
      intensive care unit (ICU) care and need for mechanical ventilation in SARS-CoV-2 infected
      patients. To provide anesthetic and surgical care to SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, many
      health workers have to organize surgical platforms, personal protections and in-hospital
      trajectories to prevent dissemination and cross-contamination. However, no data has been
      published on the surgical need of these patients, their postoperative outcomes and the impact
      they may have on the operating room.

      Postoperative outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are completely unknown. Expected
      benefits that justify a surgical procedure may be different in this population as well as the
      effects of preoperative characteristics on postoperative outcomes.

      The surgical needs of these patients, their postoperative outcomes as well as the associated
      workload imposed to operating rooms are unknown. There is a need to better quantify these and
      inform needed surgical resources in a pandemic. To address this knowledge gap, the
      investigators propose to conduct a multicenter observational cohort study in SARS-CoV-2
      infected patients undergoing a surgical procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      METHODS Objectives

      Primary: To describe the observed surgical needs of COVID-19 patients in Canadian centers.

      Secondary: To measure the association between preoperative characteristics and postoperative
      outcomes in COVID-19 patients.

      Tertiary: To quantify the operating room workload and modified workflow associated with the
      surgical care of COVID-19 patients as well as impact of a viral pneumonia pandemic on
      surgical activities.

      Exposure variables:

      To answer the primary objective, the main variables of interest will be the surgical disease
      that brought the patient to the operating room, its urgent nature and the invasiveness of the
      surgical approach.

      To answer the secondary objective, the investigators will gather baseline characteristics of
      the COVID-19 presentation as the main exposure variables: presence of symptoms at time of
      surgery, number of days since first symptoms, number of days since diagnosis, recovery,
      presence of pulmonary infiltrates, preoperative hospitalization, preoperative need for
      mechanical ventilation (still in use or weaned), oxygen need at time of surgery and received
      treatments (antiviral, steroids, antibiotics). The investigators will also gather other
      demographic characteristics, baseline comorbidities, baseline laboratory values, preoperative
      SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) score and intraoperative variables (type of
      anesthesia, type of intubation technique, blood loss, fluid balance, transfusions, duration
      of surgery).

      To answer the tertiary objective, the investigators will gather the type and number of
      personal protective equipment used per case in the operating room, the required time for
      operating room preparation and cleaning, patient extubation localization and patient disposal
      after surgery.

      Surgical care impact variables:

      The investigators will collect from operating room administrative databases the number of
      surgeries performed during the period of observation and the number of surgeries performed
      during a comparative period of observation of the preceding year in all sites. The
      investigators will also collect the mean time from operating room entry to room exit and the
      mean time from operating room exit to end of cleaning both in surgeries of the preceding year
      and in surgeries of the period of observation.

      Variable definitions:

      All COVID-19 variables will be based on either the day when symptoms start as reported by the
      patient or the first day of diagnosis (either clinical or by RT-PCR from either an
      oronasopharyngeal swab or an endotracheal specimen). The investigators will also capture
      asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carrier. Recovery at surgery will be defined as having two negative
      SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests between the last positive one and the surgery or one negative test and a
      clinically significant period without symptoms between the last positive test and the
      negative one. Surgical disease will be defined as the one reported by the surgeon. Surgeries
      will be further categorized into the following categories: neurosurgical (head, neck and
      spine), cardiac, thoracic, major vascular (intrathoracic and/or intra-abdominal),
      non-vascular abdominal (laparotomy or laparoscopy), urogenital (urology and/or gynecology),
      non-spine orthopedics, peripheral vascular, ENT and other. Any neurosurgical, cardiac,
      thoracic, major vascular or non-vascular abdominal surgery will be defined as a major
      surgery. The investigators will capture the surgical approach (minimally invasive or
      invasive) and the urgent nature of the procedure. Minimally invasive surgery will be defined
      as a one that does not need to open an anatomical cavity (laparoscopy, thoracoscopy,
      endoluminal). Urgency of surgery will be defined as one that needs to be done within 6 hours
      (emergent), between 6 and 24 hours (urgent) and can wait for more than 24 hours (non-urgent).

      The investigators will measure survival up to 30 days and survival up to 6 months will also
      be captured. The investigators will use existing definitions for the postoperative pulmonary
      complications outcome. Non-pulmonary infectious complications will be defined as any
      infection that needed antibiotics for more than 72 hours. Acute kidney injury will be defined
      by the creatinine difference of the KDIGO-AKI criteria. Myocardial infraction and stroke will
      be defined as reported by treating physicians. Mechanical ventilation will be defined as any
      mechanical support (non-invasive or invasive). All 30-day outcomes will include any day with
      the outcome and the 30-day organ dysfunction free days will use existing definitions. Time of
      room cleaning will be defined from patient transfer out of the operating room to end of
      cleaning.

      Sample size:

      The investigators plan a convenient sample size depending on the number of patients and
      center included. Inclusion will start on the 13th of March 2020. A formal statistical
      analytic plan (SAP) will be proposed according to the power this cohort may provide. The SAP
      will be published before any statistical analysis is conducted.

      Analyses:

      Descriptive analyses of baseline characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 confirmed patients
      (symptomatic and asymptomatic) will be conducted. The primary analysis will be a
      determination multivariable model on survival of these patients up to 30 days after surgery.
      A multivariable Cox model will include presence of symptoms, preoperative oxygen need and
      urgency of surgery as independent variables and a frailty factor a center random effect.

      The secondary analyses will be descriptive analyses of suspected and recovered patients and a
      similar multivariable survival model on all patients included in this study (confirmed,
      suspected or recovered). Preoperative oxygen need, urgency of surgery and disease status
      (confirmed, suspected or recovered) will be included as independent variables in this
      analysis.

      Also, the following outcomes will be reported descriptively: proportion of patients with
      pulmonary complications, thromboembolic complications, non-pulmonary infectious
      complications, need for a new postoperative ICU admission, mean hospital length of stay,
      30-day mechanical ventilation free-days and 30-day organ dysfunction free days.

      The number and types of surgeries on all patients during the observed period will be
      reported. The number of surgeries performed during the year before and the mean time of room
      usage and cleaning in all patients of both observation periods will also be reported.
