  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To understand and analyse the global impact of COVID-19 on outpatient services, inpatient
      care, elective surgery, and perioperative colorectal cancer care, a DElayed COloRectal cancer
      surgery (DECOR-19) survey was conducted in collaboration with numerous international
      colorectal societies with the objective of obtaining several learning points from the impact
      of the COVID-19 outbreak on our colorectal cancer patients which will assist us in the
      ongoing management of our colorectal cancer patients and to provide us safe oncological
      pathways for future outbreaks.

        The survey link was sent to scientific societies of interest to coloproctologists and
        disseminated to their members. Participation was entirely voluntary with no compensation
        offered. Informed consent was obtained from all those agreeing to complete a survey. This
        study was exempt from review board approval at authors' institutions.
