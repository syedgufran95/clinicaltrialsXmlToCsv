  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, Wuhan, in Hubei province, China, became the center of an outbreak of
      pneumonia caused by CoVID-19, and the number of cases of infection with CoVID-19 identified
      in Wuhan increased markedly over the later part of January 2020, with cases identified in
      multiple other Provinces of China and internationally.Given no specific antiviral therapy for
      CoVID-19 infection and the availability of Yinhu Qingwen Granula as a potential antiviral
      Chinese medicine based on vivo antiviral studies in CoVID-19, this adaptive,
      randomized,double-blind,controlled trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Yinhu
      Qingwen Granula in patients hospitalized with severe CoVID-19.

      In December 2019, Wuhan, in Hubei province, China, became the center of an outbreak of
      pneumonia caused by CoVID-19, and the number of cases of infection with CoVID-19 identified
      in Wuhan increased markedly over the later part of January 2020, with cases identified in
      multiple other Provinces of China and internationally.The clinical spectrum of CoVID-19
      infection appears to be wide,including asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory
      disease, severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure, and even death. However,there is no
      specific antiviral therapy for CoVID-19 infection, which provides a window of opportunity for
      testing candidate antiviral therapies. Previous experiences with SARS and MERS-CoV, highlight
      the need of the early intervention with Chinese medicine, and so as for CoVID-19 infection.
      The treatment of Chinese medicine for CoVID-19 infection suggested its benefits to improve of
      clinical outcomes, reduce the risk of disease progression, accelerate recovery, and reduce
      intensive supportive care and long-term hospitalization.Yinhu Qingwen Granula was a kind of
      herbal granula made from &quot;Yinhu Qingwen Decoction&quot;, which consists of 11 common non-toxic
      traditional Chinese medicine such as Polygonum cuspidatum, Honeysuckle, Nepeta, Ligustrum
      lucidum. Previous vivo antiviral studies showed its activity for the inbition of CoVID-19.
      This clinical trial is planned to evaluate the improvement of the changes in the ratio of
      PaO2 to FiO2 from the baseline for patients with severe CoVID-19 as the primary outcome, and
      to evaluate the effect of the symptoms relief and virus clearance as well as the clinical
      safety.
