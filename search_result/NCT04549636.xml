  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is currently known about the immediate and long-term effect of COVID-19 on lung
      ventilation (delivery of air to the lungs) and lung perfusion (delivery of blood to the
      lungs). Some people who survive COVID-19 may have lung ventilation and/or perfusion injury
      that persists following COVID-19 recovery. This lung injury may be related to inflammation in
      the lung, breathlessness, exercise limitation and reduced quality of life. Therefore, towards
      the goal of understanding the effects of COVID-19 on lung health, the purpose of this study
      is to characterize and understand the clinical relevance of COVID-19 related lung ventilation
      and perfusion injury and associated inflammatory status, ≤4 weeks and 6-months following
      COVID-19 recovery in an asthmatic and healthy population. To do this, an asthmatic and
      healthy population who have, and have not, been previously diagnosed with COVID-19 will be
      studied.
