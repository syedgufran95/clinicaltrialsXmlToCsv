  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence and typical patterns of neurological complications in hospitalized COVID-19
      patients admitted to the intensive care units of the University Hospital Zurich will be
      investigated. The impact of neurological complications among COVID-19 patients on mortality,
      functional outcome, and organizational outcomes will be analyzed.

    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective observational cohort study to document prevalence and severity of
      neurological symptoms among patients requiring critical care admission for confirmed novel
      coronavirus disease (COVID-19). COVID-19 is classified as severe acute respiratory syndrome 2
      (SARS-CoV-2) and shares significant structural and biological similarities with SARS-CoV,
      which has neuroinvasive properties and brainstem involvement. Early reports of COVID-19
      progression indicate presence of severe neurological complications, including seizures, coma,
      encephalitis, and cerebrovascular events including ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage,
      and cerebral venous sinus thromboses. In addition, recent data from Zika-virus and H1N1
      influenza pandemics reveal a high incidence of neurological complications, including Guillain
      Barré syndrome and neonatal microcephaly for Zika-virus and narcolepsy with H1N1 infections.
      Early reports from China suggest neurological symptoms may occur in approximately 36% of
      SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, with increased prevalence among more severe cases, and fall
      into three categories: central nervous system symptoms or diseases, peripheral nervous system
      symptoms, and skeletal muscular symptoms. However, the exact prevalence of these conditions
      and impact on patient disease severity and outcomes is unknown. As the incidence and severity
      of COVID-19 infection continues to rapidly rise on an international level, it is imperative
      to capture prospective data to accurately document prevalence, severity and clinical
      characterization of neurological components of COVID-19, the influence of treatment regimens
      of neurological complications, and role of these confounders on patient and organizational
      outcomes.
