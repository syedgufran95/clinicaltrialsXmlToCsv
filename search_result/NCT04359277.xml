  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized open label trial to compare effectiveness of two dosing regimens
      currently used for prevention of clotting events in COVID-19 positive inpatients. Both doses
      and routes of anticoagulation regimens are currently used in COVID-19 positive inpatients at
      NYU Langone Health.

    <intervention_model_description>The proposed study is designed as an open label randomized trial of patients hospitalized COVID-19 positive patients with an elevated D-dimer. Patients will be randomized to higher-dose (e.g. therapeutic) anticoagulation versus lower-dose (e.g. prophylactic) anticoagulation in 1:1 ratio.</intervention_model_description>
