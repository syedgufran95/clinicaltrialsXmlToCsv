  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a registry-based cohort study of all adult patients (≥18 years) admitted to Swedish
      Intensive Care Units with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease during the
      first 2 months of the 2020 pandemic.

      The main goal is to describe demographic characteristics, coexisting conditions, treatments
      and outcomes among critically ill patients with COVID-19. A secondary goal is to identify
      independent risk factors associated with increased mortality for these patients.

      Data regarding baseline characteristics including comorbidities, intensive care treatments
      and outcomes will be extracted. ICU lengths of stay and 30-day mortalities will be
      calculated. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality

      Previous studies reporting outcomes for COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units
      (ICUs) have been hampered by right-censoring after short observation periods. None have
      reported 30-day mortality rates and the vast majority of studies have substantial proportions
      of undischarged patients at the time of follow-up. The lack of follow-up at least to ICU
      discharge may cause bias in reported mortality rates. Further, national data on critically
      ill patients have not been previously published.

      This is a registry-based cohort study of all adult patients (≥18 years) admitted to Swedish
      Intensive Care Units with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease during the
      first 2 months of the 2020 pandemic. The Swedish Intensive Care Registry (SIR) collects data
      on patients admitted to all Swedish ICUs, with 100% coverage since 2019. Thus, SIR is able to
      report on outcomes in a national intensive care population without selection. Little is known
      about the epidemiology of COVID-19 infections in Sweden, which has one of the world's highest
      life expectancies and a significant burden of comorbidity. Coupled with Sweden's 'relaxed'
      approach to COVID-19 pandemic management, health care outcomes are understandably under
      question.

      The main goal is to describe demographic characteristics, coexisting conditions, treatments
      and outcomes among critically ill patients with COVID-19. A secondary goal is to identify
      independent risk factors associated with increased mortality for these patients.
