  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of orally administered NLRP3
      inhibitor, dapansutrile, for the treatment of moderate COVID-19 symptoms and early cytokine
      release syndrome (CRS) in an ambulatory, at-home setting.

      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by infection from a new strain of severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 is characterized by fever, cough
      and shortness of breath, which in certain patients can lead to systemic organ failure and
      mortality.

      The data show that SARS-CoV-2 activates the innate immune signaling sensor NLRP3. Activation
      of NLRP3 initiates the cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which includes the production of
      primary cytokine, IL-1, triggering an intense inflammatory response that is prevalent in
      symptomatic COVID-19 patients. When CRS advances further to a fulminant 'cytokine storm', the
      data show that respiratory distress syndrome and multiple-organ failure take place.

      As a specific inhibitor of NLRP3, dapansutrile may reduce or prevent the hyperinflammation
      associated with CRS by inhibiting the production of IL-1β early to arrest the progression to
      a severe 'cytokine storm.' The end result would be a reduction in the need for COVID-19
      patients to receive intensive medical treatment, allowing for fewer hospitalizations,
      administration of mechanical ventilation and deaths.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating dapansutrile
      versus placebo. Approximately 80 subjects randomized 1:1 (40 dapansutrile, 40 placebo) are
      planned to be enrolled.

      At the Screening/Baseline/Day 1 Visit, subjects will provide informed consent, be screened
      for eligibility, and be randomized/enrolled into the study. Subjects will also receive the
      first dose of study drug at this visit once study eligibility has been confirmed, and the
      second dose of study drug will be taken approximately 12 hours after the first dose. Study
      drug will be continued twice daily (morning and evening doses) through Day 14.

      The trial duration will be approximately 45 days for all subjects enrolled, with assessments
      as follows: Screening/Baseline/Day 1, Day 4, Day 8, Day 15 (±1 day), Day 29 (±3 days), and
      Day 45 (± 3 days). The Day 29 and Day 45 follow-up visits may be conducted virtually via the
      institution's telehealth process.

      Each subject will be asked to maintain two paper diaries at home daily for the first 14 days:
      a dosing diary and a subject diary. The dosing diary will be used to record the number of
      capsules taken each morning and evening. The subject diary will be used to record
      temperature, oxygen levels, COVID-19 symptoms, and overall health (using the prior 24-hour
      period for parameters requiring subject recall). The set of questions used in the subject
      diary will also be administered to the subjects at the Screening/Baseline/Day 1Visit
      (pre-dose), Day 15, Day 29, and Day 45 visits. Each subject will be provided a no-contact
      thermometer and a hand-held pulse oximeter at the Screening/Baseline/Day 1 Visit for home
      use.

      At Day 29 and Day 45, additional assessments of safety and clinical activity will occur. The
      Day 29 and Day 45 follow-up visits will be conducted virtually via the sites' telehealth
      process.

             Treatment Period, including specifically:

               1. use of ibuprofen or diclofenac

               2. use of colchicine

               3. use of systemic steroids within 30 days of randomization

               4. use of janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors

               5. use of off-label agents (e.g., hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, dexamethasone) and
                  biologic and oral anti-cytokine agents (e.g., current treatment with adalimumab,
                  infliximab, etanercept, golimumab, certolizumab pegol, tocilizumab, sarilumab,
                  anakinra, canakinumab, rilonacept, baricitinib, tofacitinib, or upadacitinib);

             Note: During the treatment period a patient may meet the criteria for a treatment
             approved by the FDA specifically for COVID-19 (e.g. remdesivir). In this situation the
             investigator and medical monitor should confer and take the most appropriate decision
             for the patient. If possible, the preference would be for the patient to complete the
             14 days of dosing before adding on the 2nd treatment. If that is not possible the
             preference would be for the patient to continue their 14 days on dapansutrile and
             complete all study related visits.

         12. Known history of renal impairment (e.g., calculated glomerular filtration rate [GFR] &lt;
             45 mL/min);

         13. Evidence of malignant disease, or malignancies diagnosed within the previous 5 years
             (except for local basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of
             the cervix uteri that has been excised and cured);

         14. History of infection or known active infection with human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV);

         15. Any other concomitant medical or psychiatric conditions, diseases, or prior surgeries
             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would impair the subject from safely
             participating in the trial and/or completing protocol requirements;

         16. Individuals who have been in a chronic care facility in the past 30 days;

         17. Individuals who are incarcerated;

         18. Participation in any clinical trial and/or use of any investigational product within
             the immediate 30-day period prior to the Screening/Baseline//Day 1 Visit.
