  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An increased proportion of deaths occur in the intensive care unit (ICU). Some amenable
      factors such as end-of-life practices may contribute to complicated grief.

      Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, visitor restrictions in health care facilities have been
      implemented. Families were also unable to implement usual funerals. The investigators
      hypothesize that these policies and practices may impact grief during covid-19 pandemic. The
      aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of complicated grief after death of a
      relative in the ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic.

    <description>Proportion of complicated grief 4 month after death in relative from patients who died in ICU after covid-19 infection evaluate with ICG score.
The primary outcome measure is the Inventory of Complicate Grief (ICG) score. This is the most commonly used assessment tool for complicated grief which focuses on different symptoms than depression or anxiety. A score &gt; 25 indicate complicated grief.
All patients who died in ICU after SARS-Cov-2 infection will be identify. Their relatives (spouse, children and relative who served as a surrogate) will also be identify. Relatives will be included up to 4 months after the time of death.</description>
