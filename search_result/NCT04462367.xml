      Methods: A prospective and retrospective cohort study will be conducted including pregnant
      and postpartum women with clinical or laboratorial diagnosis of COVID-19, admitted in six
      healthcare centers in the Northeast of Brazil. All pregnant and postpartum women with
      clinical and/or diagnosis of COVID-19, attended in prenatal care, in emergency (maternity
      triage), high-risk pregnancy ward, obstetric intensive care unit and rooming-in ward will be
      included. The data will be collected in specific forms. The exams will be carried out by
      trained professionals within each institution. A database will be created on the RedCap
      platform. For the association of dependent variables (maternal mortality / near miss and
      unfavorable perinatal outcomes) with independent variables (biological, sociodemographic
      characteristics, history, clinical characteristics, ultrasound modifications, doppler
      velocimetric and laboratory tests, chi-square tests will be used and Fisher's exact, when
      pertinent, with a significance level of 5%. The relative risk and its 95% confidence interval
      will also be calculated to determine the strength of association between the variables.
      outcomes, Student t or Mann-Whitney tests will be adopted. A multivariate analysis will be
      performed to determine the variables that will actually remain associated, in addition, a
      Kaplan-Meier survival curve will be constructed.
