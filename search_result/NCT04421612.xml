  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Corona pandemic is affecting the whole world and since March 12.th 2020 there has been
      strict qurantene and social isolation interventions in Norway. The aim of this intervention
      is to reduce the negative and fatal effects of the pandemic. The pandemic and the
      restrictions that follows it is assumed to affect the mental health of the general
      population. In this research project we want to examine the use and the effects of a digital
      self-guided psychological intervention with the aim to increase coping and to reduce
      psychological problems during and after the pandemic. The participants will be randomized to
      either an intensive group (new module every 3rd day) or to an ordinary group (new module
      every 5th day).

      The intervention was developed in a crossdiciplinary and cross-sectorial team within the
      framework of the research project INTROMAT, an ICT Lighthouse research project funded by the
      Norwegian Research Council. The content of the digital covid-19 intervention was based on
      four previously developed digital interventions, all based on systematic user-involvement and
      user-testing, from our group. The person-based approach inspired the development of the
      intervention. Based on the research literature and experience from our existing digital
      interventions we started the development with establishing guiding principles. The
      intervention consists of 8 modules.
