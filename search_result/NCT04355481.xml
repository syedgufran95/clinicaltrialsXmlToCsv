  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this protocol is to estimate the proportion of patients hospitalized in
      intensive care unit for a SARS-Cov-2 viral lung infection and contaminating their environment
      at 1 meter. The contamination will be assessed by quantifying the viral RNA by RT-PCR on a
      600-liter air sample aspirated by a Coriolis® system. This sample will be taken within 48
      hours after the confirmation of SARS-Cov-2 infection, documented by RT-PCR. In fact, the
      hospital hygiene measures practiced in intensive care unit in patients with viral respiratory
      infection are identical to those practiced in other services. These measures are possibly
      insufficient as evidenced by recent data related to the COVID-19 epidemic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory viruses are frequently responsible for acute respiratory failure which justifies
      hospitalization in intensive care unit. Actually, recent epidemics of emerging viruses
      (including COVID-19) have highlighted the possibility of air-type transmission in this
      specific population. Despite the fact that the risk of environmental contamination has never
      been objectified, It is probable that in intensive care patients, this contamination is
      greater than in other patients because of the gravity of the patients (greater inoculum) and
      the use of ventilation techniques responsible for probably increased exhaled viral
      expression. Defining the mode of transmission of respiratory viruses has major consequences
      in terms means of prevention. The &quot;air&quot; mode of transmission absolutely requires
      hospitalization in a single room and sometimes additional air treatment. The droplet
      transmission mode due to its short range requires simpler measures (wearing a surgical mask,
      no specific air treatment) and has also led to the discussion of the value of the individual
      room. Indeed, the use of high flow ventilation system such as &quot;optiflow&quot; or non-invasive
      ventilation, can transform a droplet risk into &quot;air&quot; risk. For this reason, measuring the
      extent of environmental contamination around infected patients in intensive care is a major
      issue.

        Patients are recruited at the intensive care unit, for all patients admitted to intensive
        care for a low respiratory infection during which the SARS-Cov-2 virus (RT-PCR positive) is
        documented within 48 hours before carrying out the air and surfaces specimens.
