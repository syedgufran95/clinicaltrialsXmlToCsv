  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is spreading throughout the United States. While
      there are no known therapies to treat those who have become sick, there have been some
      reports that a medication currently used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and malaria
      (Hydroxychloroquine sulfate, also known as Plaquenil) may help to lessen the chance or
      severity of illness, especially if combined with a medicine that treats other kinds of
      infections (Azithromycin, also known as Zithromax or Zmax or Zpak).

      There are some people who test positive for the virus but who are otherwise not ill. Current
      standard of care is to advise these people to self-monitor but no treatment is offered. It is
      not known how many of these individuals will remain symptom free, and how many will become
      sick or how severe those symptoms will be. This study will randomize those people who do not
      have symptoms into one of three treatment plans 1) Hydroxycholoquine and Azithromycin, or 2)
      no active medication (placebo). All participants will be followed for 2 months.

      The study will determine if there is any benefit to those who are asymptomatic to taking
      taking Hydroxychloroquine sulfate in combination with Azithromycin, or if there is no benefit
      from taking these medications.

      Participants will be randomized into one of two treatment plans

        1. Hydroxycholoquine sulfate in combination with Azithromycin Hydroxycholorquine as above,
           plus Azithromycine: 500 mg po for day 1and then 250 mg QD for 4 days

        2. no active medication (placebo)

      All participants will be followed for 2 months. The primary aim is to determine if there is
      any benefit (reduced likelihood for development of fever and other symptoms of COVID-19 ) to
      taking only Hydroxychloroquine sulfate, or to taking Hydroxychloroquine sulfate in
      combination with Azithromycin, or if there is no benefit to taking these medications for this
      population.
