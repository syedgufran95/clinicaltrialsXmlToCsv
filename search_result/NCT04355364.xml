  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about the effects of Dornase Alfa in COVID19 (coronavirus
      disease of 2019) patients, the medical condition caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory
      Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Dornase Alfa is a FDA-approved drug for the treatment of
      cystic fibrosis, which facilitates mucus clearance by cutting apart neutrophil-derived
      extracellular double-stranded DNA. This study intends to define the impact of aerosolized
      intra-tracheal Dornase Alfa administration on the severity and progression of acute
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients. This drug might make lung mucus
      thinner and looser, promoting improved clearance of secretions and reduce extracellular
      double-stranded DNA-induced hyperinflammation in alveoli, preventing further damage to the
      lungs.

      The study will recruit mechanically ventilated patients hospitalized in ICU who have been
      diagnosed with COVID-19 and meet ARDS criteria. It is a prospective, randomized, controlled,
      multicentric, open-label clinical trial.

      The goal is to recruit 100 patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is the most severe form of COVID-19 with a
      mortality reaching 50%. To date, no specific therapy has been shown to be effective. During
      an acute viral respiratory infection, lungs are the site of an intense neutrophil
      recruitment. Recruited neutrophils generate NETs (extracellular neutrophil traps) in the
      alveoli and bronchioles. NETs have been shown to be involved in bronchoalveolar congestion
      and amplification of the inflammatory response during viral pneumonia responsible for ARDS.
      Deoxyribonuclease 1 (DNAse 1) is an enzyme capable of cutting apart extracellular DNA
      strands, the backbone of NETs. The administration of recombinant human DNAse 1 (dornase alfa)
      leads to the loosening of the broncho-alveolar mucus and to a reduction in the inflammatory
      response within the alveoli.

      By conducting a randomized, open-label, multicenter, controlled trial, our goal is to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of aerosolized intra-tracheal dornase alfa administration in
      mechanically ventilated patients hospitalized for COVID19-related ARDS.

      This is a randomized, controlled, multicentric, open-label clinical trial to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of intra-tracheal dornase alfa administration in mechanically ventilated,
      intensive care hospitalized patients with COVID19-related ARDS.

      The comparison of D7-D0 between the groups will be carried out using a linear regression
      fitted to the stratification factors.
