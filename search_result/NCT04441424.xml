    <textblock>
      Out of 49 early-stage critically-ill COVID-19 patients, 21 patients are the experimental
      group who take convalescent plasma compared to 28 patients receive only conventional therapy
      without taking Convalescent plasma. Recovery or death, length of stay in hospital, and
      improvement in the clinical course of the disease are monitored in relation to monitoring
      through severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA detection via poly
      chain reaction (PCR), and SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM)
      serological monitoring.

      Objectives: The current COVID-19 pandemic needs unconventional therapies to tackle the
      resulted high morbidity and mortality. Convalescent plasma is one of the therapeutic
      approaches that might be of benefit. Methods: Forty nine early-stage critically-ill COVID-19
      patients residing in respiratory care units (RCU) of three hospitals in Baghdad, Iraq were
      included, 21 received convalescent plasma while 28 did not receive, namely control group.
      Recovery or death, length of stay in hospital, and improvement in the clinical course of the
      disease were monitored clinically along with laboratory monitoring through SARS-CoV-2 RNA
      detection via PCR, and SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM serological monitoring.
