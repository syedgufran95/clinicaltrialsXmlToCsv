  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-arm, phase II trial for rapid efficacy and toxicity assessment of multiple
      therapies immediately after COVID19 positive testing in high-risk individuals. Therapies
      include stand-alone or combination treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin,
      ivermectin, or camostat mesilate, artemesia annua. The hypothesis of this study is that the
      addition of agents that inhibit viral entry or replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus replication in
      will be devoid of additional moderate to severe toxicities, will prevent clinical
      deterioration, and will improve viral clearance in high risk individuals.

      Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease, caused by a novel
      enveloped RNA beta-coronavirus, also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2
      (SARS-CoV-2). The first case of this unprecedented outbreak &quot;pneumonia of unknown etiology&quot;
      was reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China on December 8th, 2019 and reported to the
      World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31st, 2019. WHO declared a COVID-19 global
      emergency on January 30, 2020, and then categorized the outbreak as a pandemic on March 11,
      2020. As of April 22, 2020, more than 2,628,894 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide and
      182,740 people globally have died from COVID-19 since it emerged in China, according to the
      data from Johns Hopkins University.

      While the majority of patients with COVID-19 develop mild or uncomplicated illness,
      approximately 20-30% of hospitalized patients have required intensive care support and 5% of
      those have multi-organ failure or shock. The case fatality rate ranges from 1 to 4% and it is
      higher among those with pre-existing comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease,
      diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension and cancer. The vast
      majority of patients present with fever (83-99%), cough (59-82%), fatigue (44-70%), anorexia
      (40-84%), shortness of breath (31-40%), sputum production (28-33%), myalgias (11-35%). Less
      than 10% of patients will present with headache, confusion, rhinorrhea, sore throat,
      hemoptysis, vomiting, or diarrhea. Anosmia or ageusia proceeding the onset of respiratory
      symptoms has been anecdotally reported.

      To date, treatments for COVID-19 in high risks individuals remain experimental and
      therapeutic strategies to deal with the infection are at best supportive, with prevention
      aimed at reducing transmission in the community as the best weapon. No proven therapies have
      been demonstrated to prevent the progression of COVID-19 to severe illness and this is a
      critical unmet need for high-risk individuals and warrants study. Recently, the Infectious
      Disease Society of America has made recommendations for the treatment of patients with
      COVID-19, focusing on inpatient care, and recommending randomized trials where possible as
      the best step to improve treatment outcomes and to increase our understanding of this
      coronavirus pandemic. Discoveries in this area may inform clinicians on effective treatment
      for low-risk individuals who progress to severe illness, as well.
