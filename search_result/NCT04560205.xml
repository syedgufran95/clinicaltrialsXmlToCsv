  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most accepted description of severe COVID-19 disease is development and over production
      of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Autopsy studies have been done on COVID-19 patients proved
      that severe disease is resulted due to deviant host-immune response and cytokine storm.
      Elevated inflammatory biomarkers like C-Reactive protein (CRP) and pro-inflammatory cytokines
      shown to be higher in severe disease of COVID-19. Several studies on severe COVID-19 have
      revealed raised levels of plasma cytokines like IL-6, IL-2, IL-10, Gamma interferon (INF),
      Tumor necrosis factor Alpha TNF. The Cytokines release syndrome (CRS) is a hyperinflammatory
      deadly syndrome characterized by release of uncontrolled immune system activation which is
      responsible for multi-organ failure. It has the main role in ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2 virus
      which binds to alveolar epithelium and resulting in IL-6 release that is responsible for
      increase alveolar-epithelium permeability. In many studies it has been observed that IL-6
      have played a main role in CRS induction. Previous experiences from hyperinflammatory and
      cytokine storm syndromes recommends that early involvement of inhibiting CRS is essential to
      prevent lethal tissue damage and poor clinical outcome. In this scenario the judgement of
      clinical specialist who are suggesting that evidence of CRS can be cured with
      glucocorticoids, I/V immunoglobulin and anti-cytokine therapy cannot be ignored.

      This is intervention single-center study, that will be done at Lahore General Hospital in
      which 95 beds are allocated for COVID-19 patients including ICUs and HDUs. Ethical approval
      will be obtained from research ethical committee of Lahore General hospital, Lahore. Informed
      consent will be obtained from all patients who will agree to publish their data in this
      research. Patient's privacy and obey will be protected with the Helsinki Declaration.

    <description>Review effect of Tocilizumab as clinical trial among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection.
Participants with severe disease will receive an intravenous (IV) injection of 8 mg/kg (not to exceed 800 mg) tocilizumab. Specifically, we will test whether tocilizumab is associated with a reduction in multi-organ dysfunction among hospitalized COVID-19 adult patients with elevated inflammatory biomarkers.</description>
