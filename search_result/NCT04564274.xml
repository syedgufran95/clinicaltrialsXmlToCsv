      Background:

      SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID. It has caused a global pandemic. Most people have
      no to mild symptoms. But some people need to be hospitalized, and a small number need
      critical care. Older age as well as some socio-demographic factors and chronic health
      conditions may play a role in the severity of COVID. In this study, researchers want to
      assess population-, disease-, and gene-based risks for features associated with severe
      SARS-CoV-2 outcomes.

      Objective:

      To measure the frequency and severity of COVID infection in people with rare and common
      diseases, looking for conditions that increase risk of severe outcomes.

      Eligibility:

      People greater than 1 month of age, both with and without rare disease, who have access to
      the Internet.

      Design:

      This study will take place online.

      Participants will visit a website. They will fill out a survey. It should take less than 30
      minutes to complete. They will answer questions about their current health and COVID
      exposures. They will answer questions about their demographic and location features that may
      impact their exposure to the virus. All questions are optional.

      Participants may repeat the survey in 6 to 12 months.

      Participants medical records may be reviewed.

      Participants may be contacted for future studies related to:

        -  COVID

        -  Their underlying health conditions

        -  A new exposure that is being studied.

      Study Description:

      This protocol will collect information on frequency and severity of COVID infection for
      patients with rare diseases and community controls.

      Study Objectives:

      Primary Objective: To quantify the frequency and severity of COVID infection in patients with
      rare and common diseases, looking for conditions that increase risk of severe outcomes.

      Secondary Objective: To identify gene-, tissue- or sociodemographic level features that
      increase risk of severe COVID outcomes that may inform future genetic modifier studies.

      Endpoints:

      Primary Endpoint: Frequency of severe infection (hospitalization +/- ICU stay and/or
      COVID-related death) secondary to COVID in patients with a shared disease designation.

      Secondary Endpoint: Frequency of severe infection (hospitalization +/- ICU stay and/or
      COVID-related death) secondary to COVID in patients with shared organ system involvement,
      secondary comorbidities, or sociodemographic differences.

      AND Frequency of any infection secondary to COVID in study patients as grouped by genetic
      diagnosis, organ system involvement, secondary comorbidities, or sociodemographic features.

      Study Population:

      The study will include people greater than 1 month old, with and without rare disease. Some
      members of the study population have cognitive impairment on the basis of their rare disease.

      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants:

      All consent and study procedures/questionnaire will be performed online.

      Study Duration:

      The study will enroll for up to 13 months.

      Participant Duration:

      After consent, participants (or their legal authorized representative) will be asked to fill
      out an online questionnaire that should take &lt;30 minutes. We may re-send the survey to the
      participants in 6 - 12 months. Filling out the second round questionnaire is preferred but
      not required. New enrollees at the time the 2nd questionnaire is sent will fill out the
      questionnaire once at Time 2. Participants will be consented for re-contact.

        Study groups (those being reported upon) include those with known rare medical conditions
        and those without (community populations). Some individuals being reported on may be
        children or those with cognitive impairment.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The person being reported upon must be 1 month of age or older. The reporter must have
        access to the internet and be able to read and answer questions in English or Spanish.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Individuals unwilling to allow sharing of their research data should not participate. With
        the use of online consents for large numbers of individuals, opting in or out of sharing
        for this low risk study creates a burden for this research study as well as the ability to
        share data with other related research studies for meta-analysis.
