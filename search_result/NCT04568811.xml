  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 2019 novel-coronavirus (2019-nCov) is the cause of a cluster of unexplained pneumonia
      that started in Hubei province in China. It has manifest into a global health crisis with
      escalating confirmed cases and spread across many countries.

      In view of the fact that there is currently no effective antiviral therapy, the prevention or
      treatment of diseases caused by COVID-19 can be tough for current treatment.

      This study is a phase I clinical trial of booster vaccination of adenovirus type-5 vectored
      COVID-19 vaccine 6 months after prime vaccination. The investigators intent to evaluate the
      safety and immunogenicity of booster vaccination of adenovirus type-5 vectored COVID-19
      vaccine in healthy adults aged aged 18-60 years.

      This is a single-center, open-label phase I clinical trial of booster vaccination in healthy
      18 to 60 years of age, inclusive, who has been prime vaccinated with adenovirus type-5
      vectored COVID-19 vaccine. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety and
      immunogenicity of booted vaccination of adenovirus type-5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine
      manufactured by Beijing Institute of Biotechnology and CanSino Biologics Inc.
