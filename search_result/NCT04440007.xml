    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, randomized 2-arm multicenter study to assess the safety and
      efficacy of STI-5656 (Abivertinib Maleate) administered orally plus Standard of Care (SOC)
      versus SOC in subjects with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 pneumonia
      (documented radiographically) requiring hospitalization.

          -  Received anti-rejection or immunomodulatory drugs (eg, anti-cytokines, BTK inhibitors,
             JAK inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors) within 30 days before randomization on study

          -  Concurrent participation in another clinical trial involving therapeutic interventions
             (observational study participation is acceptable)

          -  Any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study

          -  Any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality or psychiatric illness that
             would interfere or prevent the subject from participating in the study
