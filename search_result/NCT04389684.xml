  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To limit Corona virus dissemination on its territory, France applied strict confinement from
      March 16th to May 11th. Scientific societies recommended treatment modifications and remote
      consultations that were applied. This study evaluates the clinical impact of these care
      adaptation on patients under treatment for a digestive tumor. A special focus is made on
      quality of life and psycho-social impact of treatment modifications on patients diagnosed
      with metastatic colorectal cancer and metastatic pancreatic cancer.
