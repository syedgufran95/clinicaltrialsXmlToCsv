  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot, prospective study will assess the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent
      plasma versus standard care as treatment for severe and/or critical COVID-19 (as defined in
      the inclusion criteria) in adults 18 years of age and older. A total of 350 eligible subjects
      will receive a transfusion of anti-SARS-CoV2 convalescent plasma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will be approached for study consent based on
      the time of hospital admission and the availability of an ABO-compatible product. 300mL
      plasma units of COVID-19 convalescent patients will be utilized for transfusion. During a
      period of 14 days, the patient will be eligible to receive up to 10 units of plasma,to be
      completed with 4 hours as per institutional transfusion SOP. Transfusion by apheresis (plasma
      exchange) may be employed to reduce the risk of volume overload. The number of units to be
      used will be determined by the study team based on protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria,
      and clinical evaluation of the patient's severity and response.

      Subjects will be followed for at least 60 days or up to 3 months following initial
      transfusion for adverse event monitoring and data collection.
