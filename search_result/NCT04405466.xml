  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, epidemiological, cohort study to assess the feasibility of screening
      healthy asymptomatic workers for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV-2
      by pharyngeal swaps and serology at baseline, day 21 and day 40.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study has been designed to assess the feasibility of screening asymptomatic workers and
      to investigate the extent of infection, as determined by pharyngeal swaps analysis and immune
      response against the virus and virus specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell analysis. Furthermore, the
      extent to which virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells are induced is investigated as well as
      the persistence of virus-specific memory CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells -especially in asymptomatic
      infected persons.

      In total, approximately up to 500 workers will be enrolled into the trial to have 450
      evaluable subjects at the end of the study. There will be three individual cohorts of workers
      working in different departments: workers from the production area (cohort 1), workers from
      the laboratory area (cohort 2) and workers working in other areas (cohort 3).

      The fraction of asymptomatic or subclinical infections should be determined as well as the
      kinetics of the immune responses. For each timepoint the difference between the cohorts is
      investigated. This study also aims to evaluate the impact of sanitary and preventive measures
      taken within the company during the pandemic situation.

      Epidemiological exposure data and biological samples will be systematically collected. The
      present study is being conducted in line with World Health Organization recommendations to
      help understanding the epidemiology of SARS-Cov-2.
