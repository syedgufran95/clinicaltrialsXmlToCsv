      Importance: During COVID-19 pandemic, it is necessary to collect and analyze data concerning
      management of hospitals and wards in order to work out solutions for potential future crisis.

      Objective: The objective of the study was to investigate how surgical wards in Poland are
      managing during the COVID-19 pandemic.

      Design, Setting and Participants: An anonymous, online survey was designed and published on
      the official website of The Association of Polish Surgeons. Data was collected between March
      the 30th and April the 6th of 2020. After data analysis responders were divided into two
      groups: Group 1 (responders currently working in a &quot;COVID-19-dedicated&quot; hospital) and Group 2
      (responders currently working in &quot;non-COVID-19-dedicated&quot; hospital). The study group included
      Polish surgeons and surgery residents working in surgical departments during pandemic.
