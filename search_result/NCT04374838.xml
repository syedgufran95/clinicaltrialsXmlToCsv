      Observational cohort study to assess the effects of COVID19 on pediatric cancer care in Egypt
      and the Arab World through a survey applied to pediatric oncologists who will be interviewed
      either directly or through the internet to assess the effect of COVID 19 on pediatric cancer
      care

      Corona viruses are single stranded enveloped RNA viruses with helical capsids. They infect
      wide variety of hosts including humans and animals. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was
      first described in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province. A novel
      corona virus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was
      identified as the causative organism. On 30 Jan 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 as a Public
      Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Subsequently on 11 March 2020, WHO
      declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. On April 30, 2020; 3,239,220 confirmed cases were diagnosed
      across the globe with 228,860 deaths. The united states has the highest number of cases
      followed by spain and Italy. The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Egypt was reported on 14
      February 2020. As of April 30, 2020, there have been 5,537 confirmed cases, 1381 recovered
      and 392 deaths The overall global incidence of cancers in children aged 0-14 years is 140Â·6
      per million, whereas, It's 130.9 per million in Egypt. Although cancer is a rare disease
      among children and adolescent, It's one of the leading causes of death. The prognosis of
      childhood cancer has significantly improved over the past decades with 5-year survival rates
      improved from 58% in the mid-1970 to around 83% in 2008-2014.

      Little is known about the effects of COVID-19 on children with cancer. Children with cancer
      face numerous challenges during COVID-19 pandemic. Children with cancer are immunocompromised
      because of cancer or anti-cancer therapy. They have to be hospitalized to receive their
      anti-cancer therapy. The major problem we-as pediatric oncologist- face nowadays is how to
      organize pediatric cancer care in the COVID-19 ERA.
