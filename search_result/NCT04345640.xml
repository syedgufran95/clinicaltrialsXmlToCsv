  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To address the existing deficiencies in the knowledge regarding liver involvement and
      spectrum of clinical presentation and the impact of COVID-19 infection in patients of liver
      disease was planned. The present study will be a hospital based and the cases of confirmed
      COVID-19 infection will be evaluated in relation to liver involvement irrespective of
      pre-existing liver disease. The primary objective was to address the clinical presentation,
      biochemical alteration and outcomes of COVID-19 infection in subjects with chronic hepatitis,
      cirrhosis in comparison to those having infection in the absence of pre-existing liver
      disease
