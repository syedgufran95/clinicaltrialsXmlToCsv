  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we aim to investigate the difference between the brain response to different
      urban environments in Singapore before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. We will use the
      datasets acquired from 34 healthy individuals as part of ongoing study &quot;Effects of Landscape
      on the Brain&quot; (IRB Ref #: S-18-352). These datasets consist of neurophysiological data
      recordings and behavioral self-reported measures and were collected before 20 of January
      2020. The same experimental protocol would be followed, given that the data collection in the
      lab-setting would start after 7 th May 2020/whenever research activities are allowed to
      resume, and the outdoor sessions after the &quot;circuit-breaker&quot; period in Singapore is over.

      We want to explore the difference between pre and post COVID-19-related isolation on their
      perception of green and public spaces, as well as mood, neuroelectrical (EEG) and
      haemodynamic (fNIRS) response.

      We hypothesize that crowded, busy public spaces, such as experimental site near Chinatown
      MRT, may induce more patterns of brain activity related to stress, anxiety and aversive
      attitudes after COVID-19 as compared to before. Similarily, we expect that green urban
      spaces, such as experimental site at Hortpark, perceived after COVID-19 can elicit more
      salutogenic effect of relaxation, positive emotions and attention restoration than before the
      pandemic.

      This study will allow better understanding of the mental health consequences of unprecedented
      period of isolation at home and social distancing. The relationship between city residents
      and their living environment may change due to COVID-19 and it's very important to uncover
      the mental health implications of social distancing to prepare for potential future outbreaks
      through developing tools and solutions addressing specific issues. Finally, for the urban
      planning and design the study may highlight important trends in changing human perception of
      space and redefine the concept of a &quot;healthy city&quot;.
