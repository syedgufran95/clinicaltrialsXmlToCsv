  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled study is to assess the
      efficacy and safety of tofacitinib in hospitalized adult (18-65 years old) patients with
      SARS-CoV-2 and pneumonia who require supplemental oxygen and have serologic markers of
      inflammation but do not need mechanical ventilation.

      The purpose of this randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled Phase 2b study is to
      assess the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib in hospitalized adult (18-65 years old) male
      and female patients with SARS-CoV-2 and pneumonia who require supplemental oxygen and have
      serologic markers of inflammation but do not need mechanical ventilation (see Inclusion
      criteria). Sixty patients will be recruited to receive tofacitinib or placebo in addition to
      standard of care (SOC) in a 2:1 ratio.

      Subjects will be screened during hospitalization. Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2
      infection, and meeting all other Inclusion and Exclusion criteria, will be randomized to
      either treatment with tofacitinib or placebo in addition to SOC during hospitalization (dose
      adjusted, if required), with the exception of any immunomodulatory agents (as documented in
      the inclusion/exclusion criteria). Tofacitinib will be administered in a dose of 10 mg PO BID
      until return to their clinical baseline (as defined by need for supplementary oxygen), and
      will continue to be administered at 5 mg PO BID for a total duration of therapy of 14 days;
      follow-up off tofacitinib will continue up to Day 90. We anticipate completion of subject
      recruitment in 6 months.
