  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LIINC is a study of volunteers who were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 (also known as
      novel coronavirus or COVID-19) who have recovered from acute infection. The study is designed
      to provide a specimen bank of samples with carefully characterized clinical data. LIINC
      specimens will be used to examine multiple questions involving the virologic, immunologic,
      and host factors involved in COVID-19, with a focus on understanding variability in the
      long-term immune response between individuals.

      LIINC is an observational, prospective study of individuals previously infected with
      SARS-CoV-2 who have recovered from acute illness. The overall objective of the study is to
      investigate the clinical consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These include the
      pre-existence and development of medical conditions, measures of immune activation and
      inflammation, changes in immunologic function, and variability in host responses. There will
      be a specific focus on demographic differences including age, gender, and race.

      Enrolled volunteers are seen at San Francisco General Hospital at baseline, monthly for 3
      months and then every 3 months for up to 2 years. Visits include a detailed interview, saliva
      collection, and a blood draw. Baseline visits take approximately 90 minutes, and follow up
      visits take approximately 20-40 minutes. No personal identifiers are used for specimen bank
      samples.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Willing and able to provide written informed consent, and

          2. Age &gt;/= 18 years, and

          3. A history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as evidenced by:

               1. Available laboratory documentation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity on a nucleic acid
                  amplification test or by serologic testing when this becomes available, or

               2. Reference by the participant to a laboratory test performed on respiratory tract
                  secretions or blood, fingerstick, or saliva test that was reported to the
                  participant to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 infection,

          4. And a period of 21 days or more has elapsed since the first positive test or symptoms
             preceding the first positive test, whichever is earlier.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Self-reported or documented chronic anemia with hemoglobin &lt; 9 g/dL. Anemia during a
             preceding acute illness will not be exclusionary.

          2. Serious medical or psychiatric illness that, in the opinion of the site investigator,
             would interfere with the ability to adhere to study requirements or to give informed
             consent.

          3. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the Principal
             Investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements or to give informed
             consent.
