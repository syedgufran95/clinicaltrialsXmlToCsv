  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 virus remains in infected patients for extended periods of time. A great resource
      burden is placed on the healthcare system and society at large to isolate COVID-19 patients
      for prolonged periods. Thus, being able to increase the rate of viral clearance, thus
      reducing the duration of COVID-19 infection, would allow patients to be discharged earlier to
      free up resources for those who require it. The investigators designed a randomized
      controlled trial, investigating the use of Lianhua Qingwen, a TCM treatment, in COVID-19
      infected patients with mild symptoms. The investigators hypothesize that the use of Lianhua
      Qingwen will increase the proportion of patients who test negative for COVID-19 after 8 days
      of TCM treatment when compared to the group of patients provided with standard care and
      placebo. Patients will be recruited from community isolation facilities, and have onset of
      symptoms within 5 days prior to admission to the isolation facility. The trial also evaluates
      the time taken for relief of clinical symptoms associated with COVID-19 and assesses the
      safety of the TCM treatment given to patients.
