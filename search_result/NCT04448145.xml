  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 2019-2020 COVID-19 pandemic is the largest outbreak in recent history. It is not known
      how long after someone gets sick with COVID-19 and recovers that they can still infect other
      people. It is also not known how quickly people make antibodies against the virus, which help
      clear infection from the body. The investigators will enroll 250 people who had COVID-19
      based on lab testing to participate. Participants will complete a survey at enrollment. The
      investigators will also collect blood, nose swab, saliva, stool, semen, and breast milk to
      test for the virus. The investigators will ask participants to complete a survey and give
      specimens up to 8 times over 6 months. This information will be used to study how long the
      virus can live in different parts of the body, antibody development, and post-infectious
      complications. The investigators hope that this information will allow medical and public
      health providers to make recommendations to better care for patients in the convalescent
      phase of COVID-19 infection.

      This is an observational prospective cohort study of confirmed cases of COVID-19 recruited
      from communities surrounding New York City. 250 participants will be recruited from
      NewYork-Presbyterian (NYP)-Columbia hospital, the community using flyers and snowball
      sampling, and by contacting participants who are already participating in a Columbia
      University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) COVID-19 related study and have given consent to be
      contacted about participation in related research studies. Candidates will be eligible to
      participate if they have received a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 or were
      symptomatic and had a known contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19, and are over the age
      of 7. Participants who were diagnosed empirically due to symptoms and exposure yet test
      negative by Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and serology at baseline
      will not be considered infected with SARS-CoV-2 and may be excluded. Participants will be
      consented prior to participation in any study activities and will be prospectively followed
      for 24 weeks. At baseline, an enrollment survey will be administered that includes
      demographics, comorbidities, and characteristics of their COVID-19 illness (e.g., exposure,
      symptom onset, symptom duration, severity of symptoms) and will provide blood and host
      reservoir site samples. Participants will be followed for a 6 month period after symptom
      onset, with a maximum of 8 visits.
