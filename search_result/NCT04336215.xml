  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific objective is to rapidly establish a prospective cohort to characterize the
      factors related to viral transmission and disease severity in a large healthcare system in
      healthcare settings and HCW (healthcare worker) households. Investigators propose to address
      this hypothesis by recruiting and longitudinally following 500 HCW and 250 age- and
      sex-matched NHCW (Non-healthcare workers) within a large academic health system, Rutgers
      Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS). By intensively following participants over a six-month
      period and collecting serial biospecimens (nasopharyngeal/throat swabs, blood, and saliva)
      and questionnaire data at nine time points, investigators can uniquely characterize Severe
      Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission and risk factors for
      Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) among health care workers and their families

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective longitudinal cohort study is comprised of: (1) 500 HCW from two RBHS
      hospitals: Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) in New Brunswick and University
      Hospital (UH) in Newark ; (both hospital presidents have approved the study) (2) 250 NHCW
      from Rutgers faculty, staff, and hospital employees without patient contact; and (3)
      household members of participants who contract SARS-CoV-2 during the study period. At
      baseline, investigators will obtain nasopharyngeal or throat swabs, saliva, and blood (for
      detecting SARS-CoV-2 positivity and immunity, respectively) and collect questionnaire data on
      sociodemographic factors, lifestyle, and medical history. In participants who test negative
      for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, nasopharyngeal/throat swabs, saliva, and blood collection will be
      collected every two weeks for two months, after which monthly samples will be collected for
      four additional months (9 visits total, including baseline). Weekly questionnaire data and
      daily temperature data will be collected from each participant for the first two months of
      the study. Participants with positive nasopharyngeal/throat swabs or saliva will be
      immediately referred for medical care or home isolation as medically appropriate.
      Investigators will calculate and compare incidence rates and risk factors of SARS-CoV-2
      positivity and COVID-19 in healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers and assess symptoms,
      severity of disease, and rates and direction of household transmission.

    <description>500 HCW with high intensity direct patient care from two RBHS-affiliated academic hospitals: Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (New Brunswick, NJ) and University Hospital (Newark, NJ) and Rutgers School of Dental Medicine (Newark, NJ) . Since rates of asymptomatic carriage, clinical infection, and morbidity likely vary by age and sex, the aim is to recruit 125 HCW in each of the following 4 groups: males ages 20-59; males ages ≥60; females ages 20-59; and females ages ≥60.</description>

    <description>250 non-healthcare workers (NHCW) from Rutgers faculty, postdoctoral students, students, other trainees, administrators, and staff who do not have patient contact. The aim is to recruit even numbers of NHCW from each of these 4 groups: males ages 20-59; males ages ≥60; females ages 20-59; females ages ≥60.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Household Members</arm_group_label>
    <description>Complementing the HCW cohort study, approximately 540 household members in a subset of the participants who test positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2 will be invited to be followed prospectively to assess patterns of viral transmission. The target population will be multigenerational households (e.g., with children and/or parents) from up to 6 infected HCW, 6 infected NHCW, 4 uninfected HCW, and 4 uninfected NHCW at each timepoint. The participant will ask household members to contact research staff if they wish to volunteer for the study. Research coordinators will individually consent adult members of the household for questionnaire and serial samples collection. When children are in the home, parental permission as well as assent for children ages 7 and older (written at ages 12 and older) will be the course of action. The estimated 540 participants assumes 20 houses per timepoint, 9 timepoints, and an average of 3 participants per house.</description>
