      This is a phase I prospective, open-labeled, single-center study to evaluate the safety and
      immunogenicity of MVC-COV1901. This study is a dose escalation study with three separate arms
      for subjects at the age of ≥20 and &lt;50 years. The vaccination schedule consists of two doses
      of MVC-COV1901 for each study subject, administered by intramuscular (IM) injection 0.5mL in
      the deltoid region of non-dominant arm preferably 28 days apart, on Day 1 and Day 29.
