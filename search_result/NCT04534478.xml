  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Based on data from the 2003 SARS-COVID pandemic, other serious lung infections,
      and patients with respiratory distress, it is estimated that 10-30% of patients with severe
      SARS-COVID-2 pneumonia may present as a sequel an organized pneumonia. The treatment of this
      complication is not well defined. The use of oral corticosteroids is mandatory to avoid a
      possible evolution to pulmonary fibrosis, however, the doses to be administered and the
      duration of treatment are unknown as there is no study specifically aimed at solving this
      doubt. Many authors advocate high-dose treatment regimens for a minimum of six months, as
      proposed for cryptogenic organized pneumonia. However, there is a question whether in
      non-idiopathic cases of organized pneumonia, less intense treatment could resolve the
      disease. Hypothesis: The use of a less intensive prednisone regimen may be sufficient for
      therapeutic control in patients with post-COVID-19 organizing pneumonia, in relation to the
      established standard regimen Simplicity of the procedures: The objective of the NORCOVID
      study is to identify the optimal treatment regimen with corticosteroids in post-COVID19
      patients diagnosed with NO. Specifically, the primary objective of this multicenter
      randomized trial is to evaluate whether treatment with a less intensive regimen of
      corticosteroids produces a non-inferior therapeutic effect than the established control
      regimen. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of treatment on secondary efficacy
      variables and on safety. DLCO, respiratory function tests, 6MWT test, need for rescue,
      radiological tests, complications, mortality and the WHO ordinal scale will be evaluated.

      Hypothesis The use of a less intensive prednisone regimen may be sufficient for therapeutic
      control in patients with post-COVID-19 organizing pneumonia, in relation to the established
      standard regimen.

      Objectives The objective of the NORCOVID study is to identify the optimal treatment regimen
      with corticosteroids in post-COVID19 patients diagnosed with NO. Specifically, the primary
      objective of this multicenter randomized trial is to evaluate whether treatment with a less
      intensive regimen of corticosteroids produces a non-inferior therapeutic effect than the
      established control regimen. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of treatment on
      secondary efficacy variables and on safety. DLCO, respiratory function tests, 6MWT test, need
      for rescue, radiological tests, complications, mortality and the WHO ordinal scale will be
      evaluated.

           the investigator. 5) Clinical evidence of active infection, including but not limited to
           bronchitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, urinary tract infection, and / or cellulitis. 6)

           mellitus (glycosylated Hb&gt; 10%). 9) Pregnancy or breastfeeding 10) Have any
           contraindication to the study drug 11) Are participating in another intervention study.

      Products evaluated and administration regimens.

      The product evaluated will be Prednisone orally in two administration schedules:

        1. Control Group: Prednisone 0.75mg / Kg / d 4week; 0.5mg / Kg / d 4 weeks; 20mg / d 4
           weeks; 10mg / d 6 weeks; 5mg / d 6 weeks (6m).

        2. Experimental Group: Prednisone 0.5mg / Kg / d 3 weeks, 20mg / day 3 weeks; 15mg / day 2
           weeks; 10mg / day 2 weeks, 5mg / day 2 weeks and discontinue.

      Main variable - The main variable will be the change in pulmonary diffusion, in terms of
      predicted DLCO (%), between the baseline value and that obtained at 6 months, comparing the
      two treatment groups adjusting for the baseline value using a model of Repeated measures with
      random effects (mixed model for repeated measurements: MMRM).

      Secondary variables

        -  DLCO in original units (DLCO10s mLmin - 1mmHg - 1)

        -  Percentage of patients with values &lt;80% predicted

        -  Respiratory function tests

        -  6-Minute-Walk Test (6MWT) test

        -  Need for rescue

        -  Computed Axial Tomography Test

        -  Complications related to the evolution of the disease (serious and non-serious)

        -  Complications related to corticosteroid treatment (serious and non-serious)

        -  Complication of any kind (serious and non-serious)

        -  Mortality from any cause

        -  Ordinal variable of clinical improvement recommended by the WHO R&amp;D Blueprint expert
           group15 for the acute phase. The worst score obtained during the study will be evaluated
           at each visit and as a summary measure.
