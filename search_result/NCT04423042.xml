  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cohort study of COVID-19 patients with hyperinflammation. It aims to determine the
      impact of adjunctive Tocilizumab (TCZ) to standard of care on the reduction of
      hyperinflammation-related mortality in COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 are at high risk of
      life-threatening hyperinflammation and death. One in three COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU
      was found to develop life-threatening hyperinflammation. The risk of death when untreated is
      estimated to be 50-80%.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The novel coronavirus, SARS-Cov2/COVID-19, emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan, China. Quickly,
      SARS-CoV2 spread to all corners of the globe. In March 2020, The World Health Organization
      (WHO) declared SARS-CoV2/COVID-19 a pandemic. Individuals infected with SARS-CoV2 have a
      varied clinical presentation, ranging from asymptomatic or mild respiratory symptoms to
      severe involvement of the lower respiratory tract, with patients requiring mechanical
      ventilation. A particular point of interest is how the overall severity and clinical outcomes
      of COVID-19 patients may be associated with the excessive production of pro-inflammatory
      cytokines, or hyperinflammation, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome. This state
      of hyperinflammation may be associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients.
      Tocilizumab, an Interleukin-6 antagonist, may help treat COVID-19 associated
      hyperinflammation.

      This is a nested interventional cohort study of COVID-19 patients with hyperinflammation. It
      aims to determine the impact of adjunctive Tocilizumab (TCZ) to standard of care on the
      reduction of hyperinflammation-related mortality in COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 are at
      high risk of life-threatening hyperinflammation and death. One in three COVID-19 patients
      admitted to ICU was found to develop life-threatening hyperinflammation. The risk of death
      when untreated is estimated to be 50-80%. TCZ treatment may reduce mortality.

      Primary objective: To establish that tocilizumab, in addition to standard of care, reduces
      the 30-day mortality from hyperinflammation in COVID-19 disease significantly compared to no
      anti-interleukin therapy plus standard of care.

      Secondary objectives: To evaluate the addition of tocilizumab therapy to standard of care on
      a number of secondary outcomes.
