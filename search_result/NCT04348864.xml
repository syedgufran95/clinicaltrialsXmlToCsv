  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the research is to assess candidate COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests (e.g.
      immunodiagnostic tests, like Coris Bioconcept Ag Respi-strip COVID-19 test, and LAMP-based
      molecular tests) in order to judge their clinical accuracy compared to Centers for Disease
      Control (CDC)-recommended molecular genetic testing and clinical diagnosis. Second, it is our
      goal to determine if self-testing assisted by COVIDscanDX mobile device camera acquisition
      software platform and telemedicine clinical/technical support (virtual point-of-care)
      improves the ease of use and immediate interpretation of the tests, thus making self-testing
      comparable in accuracy and safety to testing in a clinical setting. The overall purpose of
      the study is to dramatically increase the capacity of COVID-19 testing by establishing the
      safety, ease-of-use and validity of self-testing assisted by mobile device imaging and
      telemedicine remote support.
