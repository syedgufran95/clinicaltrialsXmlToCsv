    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center randomized, controlled, and blinded clinical trial study that
      will be performed in four medical-educational centers. In this study, the samples will be
      selected from among patients with SARS-CoV-2 as easy access and based on entry criteria and
      will be randomly divided into two groups, including a control group and an intervention
      group. The study will be conducted in four medical centers. From each center, 56 definitive
      Corona patients will be selected, who will be randomly divided into two groups of 28, for a
      total of 224 patients will enter the study. In the intervention group, in addition to
      receiving the test spray, Patients will also receive standard treatment
