  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Historically and traditionally, the recommendations related to physical exercise during
      pregnancy have been based more on moral or cultural issues than on scientific evidence.
      During some phases of history, pregnancy has meant a period of seclusion for women (not only
      physical). One of the adverse consequences has been the common recommendation of rest as a
      general rule for pregnant women.

      Scientific evidence from recent years has achieved a better understanding of the process of
      pregnancy and childbirth as well as maternal and fetal responses to exercise. Currently, both
      from a scientific and clinical/obstetric point of view, there is no doubt about the benefits
      of an active pregnancy for entire body of pregnant woman, and even her child. In fact, risks
      of a sedentary lifestyle are applicable to the pregnancy situation, even more with important
      associated complications during pregnancy and postpartum period.

      Unfortunately, the impact of COVID-19 has caused an unprecedented global crisis, in this
      sense the necessary measures taken by the different administrations, especially in terms of
      confinement causes (from now on) a large number of complications affecting different
      populations. In summary a complex situation without established prevention strategies exists.

      The pregnant population is, due to the nature of the gestation and delivery process, one of
      the population groups with the highest risk of adverse outcomes and associated complications
      and whose consequences include the mother, fetus, newborn and even children. According to an
      important body of scientific literature and based on an epigenetic effect, the intrauterine
      environment can be a determining factor for the future human being to evolve regardless of
      complications and pathologies (cardiovascular, metabolic, psychic, emotional). This is
      demonstrated by numerous recent scientific evidences that confirm the unfortunate association
      between an adverse intrauterine environment (due to various factors) and observable postnatal
      pathologies in infants.

      In addition, current publications report the large number and variety of alterations that the
      COVID-19 situation causes in pregnant women and that includes the entire female organism.
      This complex situation does not only affect aspects of a physical or physiological nature,
      but also psychic and emotional factors. In summary, a new state of confinement or similar
      situations in the near future (impossibility of groupings, distance between people), avoid
      during the daily life of pregnant women one of the important and recent recommendations made
      by the international scientific community: a pregnancy physically active.

      This is especially relevant, due to the dangerous association between complications of a
      psychological or emotional nature during pregnancy with pre, peri and postnatal disorders
      (low birth weights, perinatal complications, altered and prolonged deliveries, etc.), which
      affect not only to the mother and can determine the health of the future human being.
      According to the scientific literature and based on an epigenetic effect, the intrauterine
      environment can be a determining aspect in the health of the future human being and the
      prevention of complications and pathologies (cardiovascular, metabolic, psychic, emotional).
      This is demonstrated by numerous and recent scientific evidences that confirm the unfortunate
      association between an adverse intrauterine environment (due to various factors) and
      different pathologies during and after pregnancy.

      It is evident the change that COVID-19 and its effects will generate in the lifestyle of the
      pregnant population and the increased probability of suffering associated pathologies in the
      next 24-36 months. No preventive actions have yet been planned in Spain and its public
      hospitals against the impact of COVID-19 on the quality of life of pregnant women. It is
      urgent to design and perform an adequate strategy of intervention for its possible
      prevention. From the scientific point of view, the recommendations are clear and concrete, an
      aerobic exercise program, designed and supervised by professionals from the Sciences of
      Physical Activity and Sports, is the best option for pregnant women.

      In this sense, in the last 30 years, physical exercise has proven to have many benefits for
      pregnant women, without causing risks or adverse effects on maternal-fetal well-being. This
      is confirmed by an important body of scientific literature on gestational physical exercise
      and its effects on pregnancy outcomes.

      Hypothesis Aerobic, moderate, and supervised exercise during pregnancy can be an efficient
      element of prevention of alterations that the situation generated by COVID-19 causes to the
      healthy pregnant population and their children.

      Objective Examine the influence of a supervised aerobic exercise program during pregnancy, by
      non-face-to-face and face-to-face ways, on the prevention of maternal, fetal, newborn and
      infant alterations during the pandemic state and in the near future.

      Material and Methods

      - Study design.

      A randomized clinical trial (RCT) will be carried out, not masked with healthy pregnant
      women, giving rise to two study groups: exercise group (EG), pregnant women participating in
      a regular program of supervised physical exercise and control group ( CG), pregnant women who
      receive normal obstetric monitoring of their pregnancy, including recommendations regarding
      dietary-nutritional factors, as well as the benefits of an active pregnancy.

      All selected pregnant women will sign an Informed Consent before participating in the study.

      Women randomly assigned to the CG received general advice from their health care provider
      about the positive effects of physical activity. Participants in the CG had their usual
      visits with health care providers during pregnancy, which were equal to the exercise group.
      Women were not discouraged from exercising on their own. However, women in the CG were asked
      about their exercise once each trimester using a &quot;Decision Algorithm&quot; (by telephone).

      Intervention

      General characteristics of the physical exercise program:

        -  The minimum adherence required will be 80% of the total sessions.

        -  Onset: gestational week 9-11, immediately after the first prenatal ultrasound, in order
           to rule out Obstetric Contraindications for physical exercise.

        -  End: gestational week 38-39.

        -  Frequency: 3 weekly sessions, various possibilities will be offered at different times
           from which the pregnant woman can choose, in order to promote work and family
           conciliation.

      Basic Considerations:

        1. All the activity carried out will be aerobic.

        2. Avoid working positions in which areas normally overloaded by pregnancy are further
           affected.

        3. The work corresponding to flexibility will be carried out always bearing in mind that
           these are pregnant women, this forces us once again not to include forced operating
           positions in the exercises or to excessively maintain the stretching times in each area.

        4. An adequate fluid intake will be maintained before and after the activity.

        5. Also as a general rule and to eliminate potential risks, the following will be avoided:

             -  Activities that include the Valsalva maneuver.

             -  High ambient temperatures or very humid environments in order to avoid hyperthermia
                (body temperature higher than 38º C).

             -  Sudden movements.

             -  Positions of extreme muscular tension.

      Structure:

      All sessions will begin with a warm-up of 7-8 minutes composed of mild movements and joint
      mobility of upper and lower limbs exercises. Then a central part of 35-40 minutes, four types
      of activities will be included (aerobic work, muscle strengthening, coordination/balance
      tasks, pelvic floor exercises), finally a section of flexibility, relaxation and final talk
      (comments and sharing) will be performed (12-15 minutes).

      Below we offer a greater detail of each part:

      I. Warm-up-General activation. Displacements varied without impact activities (avoiding
      jumps, falls). Mild work of mobility of the main joints.

      II. Aerobic section. Exercise to increase intensity up to moderate activities, play with
      sports equipment (balls, ropes, pikes) or choreographies of different musical styles.

      III. Muscle strengthening, general toning exercises of the whole body: lower part (calf,
      quadriceps, hamstrings, adductors, abductors), upper part (abdominal, pectoral, shoulders,
      paravertebral musculature). Also exercises for the most weakened and needy muscle groups
      during pregnancy, the aim is to avoid muscular decompensation.

      IV. Coordination and balance exercises: simple tasks of eye-hand and eye-foot coordination
      with sports equipment, as well as body axis balance exercises.

      V. Strengthening the pelvic floor muscles, Kegel exercises will be applied and is basically
      composed of contractions (slow and fast) of the different structures of the pelvic floor
      musculature.

      VI. Cool down section during 7-8 minutes, aiming to gradually lower the intensity of work
      with flexibility-stretching and relaxation exercises.

      VII. Final Talk. This part is intended for pregnant women to express clearly and openly the
      sensations and perceptions experienced during the session. The reflection of each participant
      on the effect of physical practice is sought, not only in the physical or physiological
      aspect, but also in the psychic and emotional section. The exchange of impressions between
      the pregnant women, enhances the role of a correctly designed and conducted physical exercise
      program, as a social mobile of maintenance and improvement of the quality of life of the
      pregnant woman.

    <description>The design of the physical exercise program will be supported by the Canadian and Spanish Guidelines for exercise throughout pregnancy (11,13) and published by Barakat model (10).
Frequency: The program will consist of three weekly sessions. The duration of every session will be 55-60 minutes. The intensity of the workload will be 55-60% of the maximum maternal Heart Rate, and controlled by Polar monitor (FT60). Likewise, once a week, the Borg Scale of Perceived Effort will be administered to participants, in order to have a more reliable assessment of the intensity of the activities, 12-14 (moderate; out of a 20 point scale) will be the level used.
The minimum adherence required for the participants will be 80% of the total sessions (approximately 80 sessions).</description>
