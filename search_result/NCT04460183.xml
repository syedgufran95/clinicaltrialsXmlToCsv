  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of RESP301 as an add on treatment to SOC will be evaluated for its efficacy in
      reducing rate of progression to a more severe level of COVID-19 and for safety, by comparison
      with SOC alone in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter, parallel group, concurrent, controlled study
      using a sequential adaptive design to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RESP301 plus SOC
      versus SOC alone in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen (World
      Health Organization [WHO] ordinary scale level 4).

      Approximately 300 participants will be enrolled and randomized 2:1 to the Investigational arm
      or the Control arm. The study will be divided into the following periods: Screening period:
      (up to 2 days), Intervention (up to 10 days), follow-up (Day 14 and Day 28).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participant has laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by reverse
             transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or other approved clinical testing
             prior to randomization.

          2. Participant is hospitalized in relation to COVID-19, requiring supplemental oxygen to
             maintain SpO2 at a safe level (WHO level 4).

          3. Participant is capable of giving signed informed consent

          4. Participant is male or female. All females of childbearing potential, including
             pregnant females, must consent to urine pregnancy testing at screening to be eligible
             for the study.

          1. Rapidly deteriorating or likely to require escalation to high flow oxygen, invasive or
             non-invasive ventilatory support within 24 hours according to Investigator's opinion.

          2. Unable to safely receive a nebulized treatment for approximately 4 minutes according
             to Investigator's opinion.

          3. Unable to receive or considered ineligible for invasive or non-invasive ventilatory
             support.

          4. History of methemoglobinemia.

          5. Presence of uncontrolled asthma, history of severe bronchospasm.

          6. Presence of severe chronic respiratory disease and tracheostomy.

          7. Suspected or confirmed untreated, active tuberculosis.
