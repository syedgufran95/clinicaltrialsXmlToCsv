  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to demonstrate the feasibility and validity of a saliva based home
      surveillance monitoring test for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      Participants will be asked to carry out as many tests as are included in the bag they are
      provided, on a daily basis until they are used up.

      Number of Tests Provided to Participants:

        1. Five tests to each hospitalized patient

        2. Two tests to each high risk or positive patient

        3. Three tests to each participant from the low risk population
