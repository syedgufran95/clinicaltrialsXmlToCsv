  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospital staff and emergency personnel are expected to suffer impaired psychological outcomes
      during a pandemic in terms of Quality of Life, anxiety, depression or other outcomes. The
      Covid-19 pandemic is a threat for both somatic and psychological health, therefore the impact
      of the impairment of this event on psychological parameters has to be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hospital staff and emergency personell are confronted with severe and life-threatening
      situations, therefore this group is considered to be at risk for impaired psychological
      health. A pandemic such as the Covid-19 endemic is suggested to severely impair the
      psychological state of this profession, amongst others Quality of life, anxiety, depression
      and other parameters. Therefore, it is crucial to assess the impact of impairment due to this
      global threat on the psychological health of health care providers. We therefore designed
      this study to evaluate baseline psychological characteristics and to re-assess those values
      in an interval of 60 days.
