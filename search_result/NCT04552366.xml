    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a recombinant
      adenovirus 5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine (Ad5-nCoV) with two doses and with different
      adminstration routes in healthy adults aged 18 years and older.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 168 healthy adult volunteers will be vaccinated in this clinical trial according
      to open, partly randomized design from the healthy adults aged 18 years and older. The safety
      and immunogenicity of intramuscular vaccination and mucosal vaccination of two doses of
      Ad5-nCoV in different administration schedules will be evaluated.
