  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, multi-center, open-label clinical trial. Eligible patients were
      recruited from seven hospitals in China. On the basis of standard-of-care, patients in
      treatment group inhaled H2-O2 (66% hydrogen; 33% oxygen) at 3 L/min via nasal cannula by
      using the Hydrogen/Oxygen Generator (model AMS-H-03, Shanghai Asclepius Meditech Co., Ltd.,
      China) until discharge. Patients in control group received standard-of-care (consisting of
      oxygen therapy) alone until discharge.

      oxygen therapy) alone until discharge. Clinical assessments included the five-category
      ordinal scale, four-category ordinary scale of dyspnea, coughing, chest distress and chest
      pain (0: None; 1: Mild; 2: Moderate; 3: Severe; 4: Very severe) and adverse events, performed
      on admission, at enrollment, at day 2 and 3 after randomization, and the day before
      discharge. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with improved disease severity
      (by at least one scale). Secondary endpoints comprised the change from baseline in oxygen
      saturation and symptom scales.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with lab-confirmed Covid-19 aged 18 to 75 years.

          -  Had dyspnea both on hospital admission and at enrollment.

          -  The patients volunteered to participate in this study and signed the informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have other systemic diseases other than COVID-19 -- a disease that, according to the
             investigator's judgment, might increase the risk of developing adverse outcomes or
             affect the outcome measures after participation in the study.

        Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or plan to be pregnant during the study.

        Subjects with one of the following respiratory diseases:

          -  Subjects in critical or unstable conditions. Critical (meeting any of the following
             symptoms): 1. Respiratory failure occurs and mechanical ventilation is needed; 2.
             Shock occurs; 3. Other organ failure, ICU monitoring and treatment is needed.

          -  Having immunosuppressive diseases (HIV), severe neurological disease affecting upper
             respiratory tract control, or other risk factors that the investigator believes can
             cause a significant risk of pneumonia in subjects.

          -  Subjects with mental disorder and cognitive impairment.

          -  Subjects who do not follow the study steps.

          -  Patients with mental retardation, poor motivation, drug abuse (including drugs and
             alcohol) or other disease history restricting the effectiveness of informed consent in
             this study.

          -  Use of antioxidants, including large doses of vitamin C and vitamin E.

          -  Subjects who are not suitable for participation in this study in the judgment of
             investigator.
