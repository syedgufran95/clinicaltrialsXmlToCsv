  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has been spreading continuously, and in Brazil, until August 18, 2020,
      there have been more than 3,359,000 cases with more than 108,536 deaths, with daily
      increases. The present study proposes to evaluate the efficacy and safety of using
      convalescent plasma for treating patients with COVID-19 pneumonia without indication of
      ventilatory support.
