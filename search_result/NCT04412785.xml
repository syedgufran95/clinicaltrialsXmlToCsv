  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1 safety study to determine the tolerability, clinical effects, and changes in
      laboratory parameters of short course oral or IV cyclosporine (CSA) administration in
      patients with COVID-19 disease requiring oxygen supplementation but not requiring ventilator
      support.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our overall hypothesis is that CSA is safe in this patient population and that it will have
      antiviral and anti-cytokine effects as measured in laboratory tests.

      The initial dose will be 9 mg/kg/day oral divided q12h or 3 mg/kg/day by continuous IV
      infusion. Oral administration is generally preferred, however IV administration can be used
      if oral administration is not feasible or cannot be tolerated, or at the
      physician-investigator's clinical discretion. The dose will be adjusted to target a trough
      level of 200 to 300 ng/ml, which is in alignment with common clinical practice. The planned
      duration of CSA treatment is up to 14 days, with planned discontinuation upon discharge from
      the hospital. Dose reduction of 25% to 50% can be made for patients who experience adverse
      events such as hypertension or serum creatinine elevation.

      The end of study will be study day 30 for those patients who have been discharged from the
      hospital. If the patient remains in the hospital, the subject will still complete the end of
      study visit at day 30 as planned, but will continue to be followed until date of discharge.
