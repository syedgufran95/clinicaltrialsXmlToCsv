  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are aiming to see if participant deterioration due to suspected coronavirus in a
      designated location (e.g. hotel) can be identified sooner by wearing the sensor. If we can
      identify sick participants early, participants are more likely to have better outcomes; we
      believe that the sensor can help us do this. The sensor measures heart rate, respiratory rate
      and temperature every 2 minutes and this can be reviewed by the clinical team looking after
      the participants.
