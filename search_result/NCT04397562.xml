    <textblock>
      This study is multicenter, comparative, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical
      trial with adaptive design. Females and males, aged 18 years and older, admitted to hospital
      with severe COVID-19 pneumonia on SOC therapy will receive either levilimab 324 mg s/c or
      placebo s/c. In case of no clinical improvement is observed, investigator can administer a
      rescue therapy - open label LVL 324 mg s/c. The outcomes will be assessed up to day 60.
      Results of interim analysis of safety and efficacy data of first 60 enrolled subjects will be
      submitted for independent DMC review and decision about changes to the protocol.
