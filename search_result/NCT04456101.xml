  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intent of this study was to examine the recovery of individuals who had been hospitalized
      for COVID-19 in the year following their discharge from the hospital. Parameters studied
      included serum levels of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV 2) IgG antibody, tests of lung
      function, and imaging data to evaluate changes in lung fibrosis. In addition, we explored the
      systematic Immune &amp; Inflammation in some of the individuals recovering from COVID-19.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 20% of COVID-19 developed into a critical illness and about 2% died. The global
      epidemic continues to develop, but some patients in China have entered the rehabilitation
      period, which is accompanied by a large number of respiratory symptoms and pulmonary
      fibrosis, bringing serious harm to the country. Therefore, early accurate detection and
      prediction of the development trend of patients in rehabilitation period and targeted
      treatment measures for corresponding patients are the key to the success of COVID-19
      rehabilitation period. It will play a key role in the stratified management of the
      post-epidemic situation, which is crucial to improve the quality of life of COVID-19
      patients. We aim to explore the clinical characteristics of rehabilitation patients by
      detecting some indicators of patients in rehabilitation period, including serum IgG and IgM
      antibody of SARS-CoV 2, pulmonary function, chest CT imaging, systematic Immune &amp;
      Inflammation states.
