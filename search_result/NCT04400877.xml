  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the prevalence of venous thromboembolism in a
      regional health care system (Region Östergötland, Sweden) before and during the SARS-COV-2
      pandemic. In a retrospective observational study, we will review patient data, diagnostic
      data and treatment data over a three-month period since the onset of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic.
      This data will be compared with data from the corresponding time frame during the years 2015
      to 2019.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the current SARS-COV-2 pandemic there is a concern about an increased risk of venous
      thromboembolism (VTE) concurrent with the infection, including both pulmonary embolism (PE)
      and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) (Klok et al. 2020; Cui et al. 2020; Helms et al. 2020;
      Leonard-Lorant et al. 2020; Poissy et al. 2020). International guidelines now recommend
      prophylactic anticoagulation for all hospitalized patients with a SARS-COV-2 infection in the
      absence of any contraindication (Thachil et al. 2020). The majority of the studies on VTE in
      SARS-COV-2 infections have been carried out in the ICU and show prevalence of VTE of between
      20 and 30%.(Klok et al. 2020; Cui et al. 2020; Helms et al. 2020). This is a clear increase
      compared to the less than 10 % prevalence seen in other ICU patients (Muscedere, Heyland, and
      Cook 2007; Deborah Cook et al. 2005; D. Cook et al. 2000). However, a single center study on
      consecutive ICU patients with severe sepsis showed a prevalence of VTE of 37% (Kaplan et al.
      2015) and another recent publication of patients with severe influenza A/H1N1 infection had a
      prevalence of VTE of 44% (Obi et al. 2019).

      This raises the question whether the increase in VTE seen in recent publications of
      SARS-COV-2 infections is the result of the specific pathophysiology of the virus itself or
      the subsequent sepsis with multiorgan failure seen in most complicated and severe cases. The
      former would have large implications for patients treated outside the ICU and possibly
      outside hospitals (Thachil et al. 2020).

      The aim of this study will be to investigate the prevalence of VTE in a regional healthcare
      system prior to, and during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic and the differences between ICU,
      hospitalized and outpatient cohorts.
