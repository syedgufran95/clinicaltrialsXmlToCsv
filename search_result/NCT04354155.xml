      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, dose-requirements, and exploratory
      efficacy of twice-daily subcutaneous enoxaparin as venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in
      children (birth to 18 years) hospitalized with signs and/or symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection
      (i.e., COVID-19).

    <measure>Safety of in-hospital thromboprophylaxis</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>To investigate the safety of in-hospital thromboprophylaxis with twice-daily low-dose enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis as measured by cumulative incidence of ISTH-defined clinically-relevant bleeding events during hospitalization. Clinically relevant bleeding episodes may include any of the following: 1) fatal bleeding; 2) clinically overt bleeding associated with a decline in hemoglobin of ≥2g/dL in a 24h period; 3) retroperitoneal, pulmonary, or central nervous system bleeding; 4) bleeding requiring surgical intervention in an operating suite; 5) bleeding for which a blood product is administered (blood product administration not directly attributable to the patient's underlying condition); 6) bleeding that requires medical or surgical intervention to restore hemostasis, other than in an operating suite.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median twice-daily enoxaparin dose</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours post initial dose</time_frame>
    <description>The median twice-daily enoxaparin dose, as measured in mg/kg, required to achieve a 4 hour post-dose anti-factor Xa level of 0.20-0.49 anti-Xa U/mL in children hospitalized with COVID-19, and to compare dose-requirements by age group (birth to &lt;1 year old, 1-&lt;6 years old, 6-&lt;13 years old, and 13-&lt;18 years old).</description>

    <time_frame>Enrollment, Day 1, Day 2, and Day 3, 7, and 14 if still hospitalized</time_frame>
    <description>To investigate, on a preliminary basis, the efficacy of in-hospital thromboprophylaxis with twice-daily enoxaparin in children hospitalized with COVID-19, as measured by the proportion of serial D-dimer levels obtained at standardized time points that are &lt;2 times the upper limit of normal (&lt;2x ULN) values for age.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of in-hospital thromboprophylaxis as measured by median duration of increased respiratory support</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>To investigate, on a preliminary basis, the efficacy of in-hospital thromboprophylaxis with twice-daily enoxaparin in children hospitalized with COVID-19, as measured by median duration of in-hospital increased respiratory support (new requirement for high-flow nasal cannula, non-invasive ventilation, and/or mechanical ventilation, relative to any at-home baseline requirement).</description>
