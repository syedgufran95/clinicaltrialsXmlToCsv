  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At the time of writing (3/4/2020), close to a million people have been infected by the
      SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus around the world. The severe clinical condition that leads to deaths
      is now called CoVID-19. Currently, there are no effective treatments for the early or late
      stages of this illness. Governments worldwide have undertaken dramatic interventions to try
      and reduce the rate of spread of this deadly coronavirus.

      Early data from multiple studies in China, where the virus originated, show that severe cases
      of CoVID-19 are not as prevalent in patients with chronic lung diseases as expected. This
      data has been confirmed by the Italian physicians. The investigators think that the
      widespread use of inhaled corticosteroids reduces the risk of CoVID-19 pneumonia in patients
      with chronic lung disease. Early microbiological data also shows that these corticosteroids
      are effective at slowing down the rate of coronavirus replication on lung cells.

      Inhaled corticosteroids are widely used to manage common lung conditions, such as asthma.
      This type of medicine is among the top 3 most common medication prescribed around the world.
      Their safety is well understood, and their potential side effects are mild and reversible.

      The investigators propose to test this idea that, in participants early in the course of
      CoVID-19 illness, daily high dose inhaled corticosteroids for 28 days, will reduce the
      chances of severe respiratory illness needing hospitalisation. We will also study the effect
      of this inhaled therapy on symptoms and viral load.
