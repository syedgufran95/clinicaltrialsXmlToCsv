      Cross-sectional non-incentivized worldwide web survey.

      A worldwide survey of 1050 respondents showed that proctologic practice has been seriously
      affected by the pandemic. Age, gender and level of hospital preparedness predicted the change
      of status of surgical and outpatient activities.

      The results of our study may inform the development of strategies to reopen activities while
      protecting frontline healthcare workers.

      A 27-item survey (namely, 'ProctoLock 2020') was designed and developed by the authors using
      an online platform ('Online surveys' [formerly BOS - Bristol Online Survey], developed by the
      University of Bristol) in accordance with the American Association for Public Opinion
      Research (AAPOR) guidelines and the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys

        Experts in the field who joined a previous qualitative study[15] (N=492) were invited to
        complete a web survey (participants could be identified only via their valid email address;
        no other identifying information was collected). The survey link was sent to scientific
        societies of interest to coloproctologists (i.e. Italian Society of Colorectal Surgery,
        Russian Association of Coloproctologists, Mediterranean Society of Coloproctology) and
        disseminated to their members. All collaborators (ProctoLock 2020 Working Group) committed
        to further recruitment of participants by direct invitation. Participation was entirely
        voluntary with no compensation offered. Informed consent was obtained from all those
        agreeing to complete a survey. This study was exempt from review board approval at authors'
        institutions.
