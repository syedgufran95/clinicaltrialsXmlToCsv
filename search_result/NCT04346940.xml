  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An epidemic of pneumonia , which is thought to have developed due to a new coronavirus, was
      detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province of the People's Republic of China, and this epidemic could
      not be brought under control, leading to other provinces of China in a short time and then to
      a pandemic. It has spread all over the world including the European continent. Causative
      Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease caused by the new virus
      (novel) coronavirus-2019 (2019-nCoV) and subsequently the COVID-19. After the virus was
      officially detected in our country on 11 March 2020, the number of cases increased rapidly
      and the virus was isolated in 670 patients within 10 days. The group that is most affected by
      the outbreak and has the highest mortality rate is the elderly with known cardiovascular
      diseases. It is important to ensure the social isolation of elderly patients and to minimize
      all hospital applications as much as possible if they do not have life-threatening urgent
      problems. To this end, Turkey on 21 March 2020, 65 years of age and older people and patients
      with chronic curfew was implemented.

      Individuals moving away from social life are dealing with their body more, their level of
      depression and anxiety increase, and their physical functions decrease. The therapy service
      is offered to people who cannot travel with telerehabilitation, which is defined as the
      transmission of rehabilitation service to long distances by using electronic information and
      communication technology.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of telerehabilitation exercises given
      to elderly individuals on sleep quality, quality of life and balance within the scope of
      geriatric rehabilitation.

    <measure>Standardized Mini Mental Test</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Screening test in which cognitive functions are evaluated globally. With standardized mini mental test, the patient is evaluated under 5 main topics. The patient receives a maximum of 30 minimum 0 points at the end of the test. The critical score here is 27 or 24. It is decided that patients scoring below 24 have cognitive impairment. In some cases, the limit is considered to be 27 points.</description>

    <measure>Mini Nutritional Assesment</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) has recently been designed and validated to provide a single, rapid assessment of nutritional status in elderly patients in outpatient clinics, hospitals, and nursing homes. sum of the MNA score distinguishes between elderly patients with: 1) adequate nutritional status, MNA ≥ 24; 2) protein-calorie malnutrition, MNA &lt; 17; 3) at risk of malnutrition, MNA between 17 and 23.5.</description>

    <measure>Short Physical Performance Test</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The short physical performance battery (SPPB) is a group of measures that combines the results of the gait speed, chair stand and balance tests. It has been used as a predictive tool for possible disability and can aid in the monitoring of function in older people. The scores range from 0 (worst performance) to 12 (best performance). The SPPB has been shown to have predictive validity showing a gradient of risk for mortality, nursing home admission, and disability.</description>

    <measure>Single Leg Stance Test</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The one-leg standing (OLS) test is one of the balance tests used to diagnose musculoskeletal ambulation disability symptom complex (MARS), a condition newly defined by three professional Japanese medical societies in 2006 to help identify the symptoms of motor organ deterioration and establish preventive strategies. Although many studies have used the OLS test, none has shown conclusively that the test can be used as a practical marker of frailty among elderly people, especially in community settings.</description>

    <description>15 volunteers aged 65 and over will be included in this group. An online exercise program has been created for individuals who will participate in the study. It is planned that this program will continue for 3 days a week, 6 weeks, and the duration of exercise will reach 45 minutes in the last week due to the increase in the number of repetitions about 30 minutes at the beginning. The treatment sessions will start with warm-up exercises, complete with posture exercises, joint range of motion exercises, stretching exercises, and cool-down exercises in the main program.</description>
