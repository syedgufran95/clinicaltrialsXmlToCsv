  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project is a part of the &quot;Protocol for a multicentre study of nosocomial SARS-CoV2
      transmission: The NOSO-COR Project&quot; registered in ClinicalTrials (NCT04290780).

      In the current pandemic context, medical resources have often been exceeded. Developing,
      using artificial intelligence techniques, an algorithm capable of detecting patients at risk
      of acute respiratory distress following Sars-Cov2 infection could help physicians to optimize
      the treatment of patients and health decision-makers to optimize resources. Thus, the goal of
      this project is to create a prediction model using artificial intelligence to predict an
      unfavorable evolution of Covid-19 at the hospital admission of patients

        The project is a part of the &quot;Protocol for a multicentre study of nosocomial SARS-CoV2
        transmission: The NOSO-COR Project&quot;

        It is an international multicentre prospective, observational, hospital-based study in
        adults. It will include volunteer patients, care givers and healthcare professionals in
        France and hospitals affiliated with the GABRIEL network. Demographic and clinical data
        will be collected using case-report forms designed especially for the purpose of the
        project. A nasopharyngeal swab will be collected and tested for SARS-CoV2 by RT-PCR.
        Characteristics of the study participants, the proportion of confirmed nosocomial SARS-CoV2
        infections relative to all patients with syndromes suggestive of 2019-nCoV infection will
        be analyzed.
