      A prospective, longitudinal, observational cohort study looking at patients following
      COVID-19 disease using multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the degree
      and prevalence of organ injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, correctly, all of the Government's efforts have been dedicated to providing
      sufficient hospital space, and the appropriate equipment, for treating the most serious cases
      of COVID-19. Equally, enormous resource is being dedicated to developing technologies that
      determine who has the disease, and who has developed antibodies to it.

      However, patients recovering from serious disease will also pose a huge, ongoing challenge.
      Not only are people with co-morbidities including underlying fatty liver disease, metabolic
      syndrome and diabetes at higher risk for complications with COVID-19; but patients discharged
      from hospital after severe COVID-19 are reported to have liver and kidney injuries, and
      impacts on pancreas and spleen. However, the extent of organ health/damage has not been
      mapped.

      This is a prospective, longitudinal, observational cohort study looking at patients
      recovering from COVID-19 disease using multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to
      assess the degree and prevalence of organ injury. This proposed study aims to measure the
      prevalence of organ volume changes and damage in lungs, heart, kidney, liver, pancreas,
      spleen as assessed by MRI among those having recovered, or recovering, from the SARS-CoV-2
      infection - participants will have a final MRI scan at 12 months. Assessing the severity and
      sequelae of COVID-19 in patients is crucial to enable global planning for health-care needs.
      The study includes up to 3 visits for MRI scans and blood tests over a 12 month period. All
      participants will receive standard-of-care by their healthcare provider/s.

    <description>Participation in the study includes up to 3 visits to a partnering imaging facility - this will include measurement of height and weight (to calculate BMI), blood pressure measurement, 3 sets of blood tests, 3 Questionnaires and 3 MRI tests.
There will be no medical interventions as part of the study. All participants will receive standard-of-care by their healthcare provider/s. With the participant's consent, the participant's primary care physician will be made aware of their participation in the study. Furthermore, participants will be informed of any structural abnormalities found in the MRI scan (e.g. abnormal vessels, haemangioma, tumour, cyst, among others) and abnormal blood test results as these may have clinical implications.</description>

        Participants will be recovered or recovering from COVID-19 disease, at least age 18 years
        and invited to partake in this study. Participants will previously have experienced
        symptomatic and confirmed COVID-19 disease and will be outpatients able to breath
        independently without oxygen. Participants will have been discharged back into the
        community with no respiratory symptoms for at least 7 days. Although subsequent negative
        testing for infectivity is ideal prior to study entry, participants will be considered
        non-infectious based on the absence of any fever or severe cough for at least 7 days, as
        per the advice of the UK Chief Medical Officer.
