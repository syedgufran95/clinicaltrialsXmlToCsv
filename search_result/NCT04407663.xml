  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric patients represent a peculiar and frail subset of subjects, constantly increasing.
      During the novel coronavirus disease outbreak, for the lockdown of any non-urgent and
      non-oncological activity, the access to healthcare services was severely limited, according
      to the International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The constant and strict follow-up is mandatory in this special subset of patients. Therefore,
      starting from the telemedicine experience in different medical fields, in our bariatric
      surgery division we designed and started a dedicated project to follow-up obese patients
      using remote counselling.

    <description>Patients that referred for the first time to our bariatric center were investigated for anthropometric, psychological and instrumental data in order to evaluate the eligibility for a future bariatric procedure. In established patients, eligibility for tele-consultation was evaluated by three experienced physicians, consulting the stored patients' data. All included patients provided oral informed consent. Patients approached the virtual visit with their personal smart devices, desktop or laptop computer. Medical counselling was performed using a desktop or laptop computer from the Hospital or home in a smart working modality. The video call was carried out using Skype platform by Microsoft®; any document drawn up by the physician was saved as pdf using the Cute Professional™ PDF software, that allows to add passwords and set security options to protect the patients' data.</description>
