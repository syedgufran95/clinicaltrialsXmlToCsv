  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SARS-CoV2 virus causes severe or even fatal disease in a fraction of infected people. The
      clinical severity is based on a complicated pneumopathy with acute respiratory distress
      syndrome that can lead to multi-visceral failure. The underlying mechanism is a cytokinergic
      storm, an emerging facet of immunological dysregulation.

      This clinical trial is aimed to understand the mechanisms of this immunological dysregulation
      in order to identify therapeutic levers.

      The main objective is to understand the relationships between clinical severity, death or
      morbidity of resuscitation management, and immune status (i.e., immune pathways activated or
      not). Immune status will be investigated at many levels of organization (i.e., circulating
      leukocytes, cytokines and chemokines, transcripts).

      The secondary objectives are :

        -  to understand what is responsible for clinical severity, viral load, or immune
           activation;

        -  to highlight the consequences of immunological dysregulation on associated risks (i.e.,
           immunosuppression leading to the emergence of infectious comorbidities) as well as the
           functioning of neurotransmission through metabolic pathway diversions. The impact of
           dysimmunity on these biological pathways will be assessed with a metabolomic analysis;

        -  to understand the mechanisms of vulnerability related to the field. Moreover, while
           co-morbidities are likely to be a risk factor for severe disease progression, there are
           many situations in which they do not occur. Stress, with its neurovegetative and
           endocrinological dimensions, modulates the immune response. It is essential to know
           whether the stress response plays a role in immunological dysregulation. This analysis
           is a prerequisite for understanding the conditions of treatment with glucocorticoids.

      Angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) also plays a likely role in host viral infection.
      It is also thought to play an important role in the emergence of severe syndromes by
      affecting the quality of vascular response.

        The target population is a population infected with SARS-CoV2 and justifying
        hospitalisation in an intensive care unit, i.e. presenting at least one immediate vital
        failure that would lead in short term to the death of the patient without the
        implementation of an adapted active therapeutic intervention. As the variable of interest
        is immuno-inflammatory activation, patients with an immune deficiency of any origin will be
        excluded. Patients will be recruited from patients admitted to the intensive care unit with
        biological confirmation of SARS-Cov2 infection.
