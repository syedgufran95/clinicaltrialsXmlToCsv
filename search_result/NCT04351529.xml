      The AGMT_COVID-19 Registry is designed as multicenter observational cohort of patients, that
      are tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Data will be collected from all sites in Austria willing
      to participate.

      Due to the non-interventional nature of the AGMT_COVID-19 registry, only routine data, which
      has already been recorded in the patient's medical chart, is transferred to the eCRF.

    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first identified at the end
      of 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in central China, and has since spread
      globally.

      There are currently no authorised vaccines or treatments in the EU (European Union) to
      prevent or treat novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) specifically or any other
      coronaviruses.

      The AGMT_COVID-19 Registry is designed as multicenter observational cohort of patients, that
      are tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Data will be collected from all sites in Austria willing

      Treatment indication, the decision to offer treatment, treatment choice, dose, schedule and
      dose reductions/escalations, and response assessments shall be exclusively based on the
      risk/benefit estimation of the treating physician.
