  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to document the feasibility and tolerability of low dose
      thoracic radiotherapy in patients with WHO level 5 COVID 19 infections.

    <textblock>
      Subjects will be identified following admission to hospital who test positive for COVID-19
      infection. They will then be informed and consented, and eligibility confirmed and registered
      to study. Following this the first, sentinel patient, will be treated with 0.5Gy dose
      radiotherapy to cover the lungs, with heterogeneity correction. A further 0.5Gy dose can be
      repeated within 96 hours. There shall then be a 7 day gap prior to recruiting patient 2. The
      remaining patients will be recruited, treated and observed in cohorts of 3.

      The patients shall then be followed up at 48 hours post Radiotherapy, 7 days post
      radiotherapy and 29 days post radiotherapy. With assessment of Physiological parameters,
      survival status, laboratory testing and imaging performed on follow up at 7 and 29 days.
