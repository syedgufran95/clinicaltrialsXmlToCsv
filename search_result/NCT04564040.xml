  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 study is being conducted to support the clinical development of acalabrutinib in
      hospitalized patients who are unable to swallow acalabrutinib tablet or capsule due to
      respiratory failure, eg, they may require endotracheal intubation for ventilator support and
      nasogastric (NG) tube placement, and it is important to have a clinically acceptable method
      to administer acalabrutinib via NG tube.

      Part 1 of the study is designed to evaluate relative bioavailability by comparing the
      pharmacokinetic (PK) of AT suspension in water administered via NG tube with the PK of
      acalabrutinib capsule suspension in flat COCA-COLA administered via NG tube. Additionally,
      the PPI effect will be evaluated by comparing the PK of AT suspension in water administered
      via NG tube plus rabeprazole with the PK of AT suspension in water administered via NG tube.

      Part 2 of the study is designed to evaluate the effect of NG administration on AT by
      comparing the PK of AT suspension in water administered via NG tube with the PK of AT orally
      administered with water.

           2, ie, subjects will be discharged the morning of Day 3, Treatment Period 2.

        -  A Follow-up Visit within 7 to 10 days after the last dose of acalabrutinib.

      There will be a minimum washout period of 4 days between treatment periods. Up to 20 subjects
      will be included to ensure at least 16 subjects are evaluable. Subjects will be randomized to
