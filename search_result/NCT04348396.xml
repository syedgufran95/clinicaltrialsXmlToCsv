  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project is an observational, prospective study. Its aim is to deepen our understanding of
      COVID-19 in older patients hospitalized and diagnosed with COVID-19.

      In particular, socioeconomic, diagnostic, biological, functional, therapy data will be
      collected at the patients' admission, during hospital stay, at the discharge and 1, 3, 6, 12
      months after discharge.

      Results and findings will help support changes in clinical practice and decision making, with
      the aim to reduce the use of healthcare services and the healthcare expenditure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current knowledge about clinical and biological characteristics of COVID 19 among older
      people is very limited. A better comprehension of the clinical picture of older patients
      affected by COVID-19, (e.g. frailty, multimorbidity and polypharmacy patterns and functional
      performance) may significantly contribute to deepen our understanding of the clinical
      epidemiology knowledge of COVID-19 among hospitalized older people.

      Therefore, the ReportAge-COVID project aims to collect - using a minimum clinical and
      biological data set - a series of data and indicators on the conditions of elderly patients
      that are suspected of having a compatible clinical picture or were confirmed positive for
      COVID-19. Data will be collected at the patients' admission, during hospital stay, at
      discharge and 1, 3, 6, 12 months after discharge.

      In particular, the following specific pieces of information will be gathered:

        -  routinely collected demographic, socioeconomic, clinical, biological and diagnostic data

        -  frailty condition (by using the clinical frailty scale)

        -  assessment of the functional capacities through ADL and IADL tests

        -  health conditions; nutritional status; medications; treatments and procedures

        -  biomarkers of aging including cytokines and anti-inflammatory molecules, previously
           identified in a focus group of experts

      Results and findings will help support changes in clinical practice and decision making, with
      the aim of reducing adverse outcomes, the worsening of health conditions in the elderly
      population, the use of healthcare services and, as a consequence, lower healthcare
      expenditure.
