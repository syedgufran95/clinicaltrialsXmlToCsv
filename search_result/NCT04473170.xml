  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SENTAD-COVID Study is an adaptive, prospective, multicentric, open-label, and randomized
      controlled clinical trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed coronavirus
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection during the outbreak in Abu Dhabi, 2020. The patients were
      randomly allocated in a parallel assignment involving two groups of participants: Group A
      (Experimental arm): autologous non-hematopoietic peripheral blood stem cells (NHPBSC) therapy
      as add-on COVID-19 standard care, or Group B (No investigational intervention arm): COVID-19
      standard care. Standard care is defined as per the &quot;UAE National Guidelines for Clinical
      Management and Treatment of COVID-19&quot;. SENTAD-COVID Study was conducted in the Sheikh Khalifa
      Medical City (SKMC) of Abu Dhabi, as Primary Care Clinical Trial Unit, while the cell
      processing and investigational product formulation were completed by Abu Dhabi Stem Cells
      Center (ADSCC), according to Good Laboratory Practices (GLPs) and Good Manufacturing
      Practices (GMPs).

      Group A patients received autologous NHPBSC therapy through jet nebulization, in addition to
      the standard care, while Group B (No investigational intervention arm) received only the UAE
      approved standard care. The primary endpoints were the safety and efficacy assessment,
      measured as Adverse Reactions (ARs) incidence [according to World Health Organization -
      Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) causality assessment system], rate of mortality within
      28-days, and the time to clinical improvement of 2 points on a seven-category ordinal scale
      or discharge from the Hospital, whichever came first. Immune response profile, acute-phase
      serum markers, and coagulation testing profile were evaluated as well, before treatment
      (baseline - Day 0), at Day 14, and Day 21 (in patients with early response, defined as 2
      points of difference in the clinical critical treatment index within 7 days of treatment, the
      assessment will be performed at Day 7). The trial was approved by the institutional ADSCC
      Research Ethics Committees (REC), and the Emirates Institutional Review Board (IRB) for
      COVID-19 Research and the written informed consent was obtained from all patients or from the
      patient's legal representative if the patient was too unwell to provide consent. SENTAD-COVID
      Study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the
      Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization
      (ICH). The authors were responsible for designing the trial and for compiling and analyzing
      the data.
