  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the context of the containment imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and taking into account
      the numerous restrictions imposed, the practice of physical and sports activities (PSA) could
      be reduced by general population and sports population. While the practice of regular
      physical activity (PA) is prescribed and widely recognized as effective for the management of
      many chronic conditions and that regular participation in sports (SA) reduces the risk of
      injury and cardiac accidents- vascular disease in sports subjects, the reduction in regular
      physical activity levels in the wake of the period of confinement is likely to induce a
      medical risk in connection with the resumption of PSA.

      The study is non-interventional. The data that will be collected are data that can be
      integrated into a care procedure in accordance with the recommendations to accompany the
      patients with chronic pathology and athletes for the resumption of PSA after hypothetical
      deconditioning. Support will be implemented in accordance with the recommendations of the
      HCSP and the Ministry of Sports. The objective of this study is to evaluate the data of this
      recommended medical follow-up.

      The questionnaires used for the subjects' self-evaluation are all validated in French
      language, used in the context of medical monitoring, and used in clinical research:
      assessment of physical activity levels by the questionnaire of RICCI and GAGNON (RG),
      evaluation of the level of Anxiety and Depression by the Hospital and Anxiety Scale
      Depression (AHH), assessment of sleep quality by the score of LEEDS.

      Medical questionnaires to assess the evolutionary stage of chronic pathologies (MS,
      Parkinson's disease and Fibromyalgia) will be informed by the investigating physician during
      the interview telephone with the patient.
