  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood samples from participants who have recovered from COVID-19 infection will be obtained
      and studied. The goal of the research is to identify antibodies that have been generated by
      the patient to fight the COVID-19 infection. By identifying the most effective antibodies,
      scientists can make specific antibodies to use to prevent future coronavirus outbreaks or to
      treat patients with severe disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused over 1,273,712 infections and over 69,458
      deaths worldwide. Columbia University Irving Medical Center/NewYork-Presbyterian (CUIMC/NYP)
      has assembled a team of committed virologists, molecular biologists, chemists, and
      technologists to address this emerging threat. Monoclonal antibodies have become great
      additions to our therapeutic arsenal, primarily in treating cancer or autoimmune diseases.
      Recently, the use of monoclonal antibodies in combating infections such as respiratory
      syncytial virus and HIV have also become clear. In recent years, advanced cell sorting and
      sequencing technologies have been utilized to identify neutralizing antibodies from human B
      cells. This protocol will outline our approach to obtaining blood specimens from participants
      who are recovering from COVID-19 infection. Potential participants will be referred by health
      care providers from within the CUIMC/NYP system and from outside institutions. If the
      potential participant agrees to be contacted, study staff will call them to review the
      informed consent, eligibility criteria and study procedures, and set up a study visit for
      blood draw. Monoclonal antibodies that could potently neutralize 2019 novel coronavirus
      (2019-nCoV) and related coronaviruses will be isolated from these specimens. Candidate
      monoclonal antibodies will then be optimized and evaluated for therapeutic potential. The
      ultimate goal would be able to produce a monoclonal antibody that could confer protection
      during an outbreak or be utilized to treat patients with severe COVID disease.

    <description>The blood specimen will be proceeded into peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma to be stored for testing. In brief, CD27+ memory B cells that can bind to a SARS-CoV-2 S protein bait will be sorted by flow cytometry and RNA will be extracted to obtain heavy and light chain sequences. Antibody sequences will be annotated using bioinformatics approaches, and candidate sequences will be cloned. Purified antibodies will be characterized and neutralization breadth and potency against SARS-CoV-2 and other related coronaviruses will be assessed using neutralization assays.</description>
