  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, participant-blinded, placebo-controlled, pilot study to
      assess the preliminary efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of
      patients with lower respiratory tract SARS-CoV-2 infection.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 40 participants are planned for enrollment. Those enrolled into this study will be
      randomized 1:1 to receive either hydroxychloroquine or placebo control.

      Participants will receive their study intervention for 5 days, after which they will be
      considered off protocol- directed therapy and receive medical management of their disease
      according to institutional standards. Participants may be followed for up to 180 days from
      initiating protocol therapy for clinical outcome, after which they will discontinue study
      participation.

    <description>Hydroxychloroquine is more polar, less lipophilic, and has more difficulty diffusing across cell membranes than the parent compound, chloroquine. These characteristics result in hydroxychloroquine having a longer half-life, comparatively lower toxicity to chloroquine, as well as fewer concerns pertaining to drug-drug interactions</description>

             or compromise the ability of the patient to give written informed consent.
