  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted anesthesia care all over the world. There remains very
      little data on current practice patterns and patient outcomes, particularly in anesthetized
      children. This is a prospective observational, multi-center study to investigate airway
      management related outcomes in children undergoing anesthesia during this pandemic. The
      investigators will compare the incidence of complications (particularly hypoxemia) in
      patients with COVID-19 to those who are COVID-19 negative during airway management.

        The study population will include all children (from birth to 18yrs) receiving sedation or
        general anesthesia for an elective, emergency, or urgent diagnostic or surgical procedure.
        Each institution will collect de-identified data on all children under anesthetic care for
        a two week period. In addition, data collection for all children who are positive or
        presumed positive for COVID19 receiving anesthetic care will be collected outside of the
        two week period until study completion.
