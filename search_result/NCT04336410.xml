        Inclusion Criteria:

             examination and vital signs performed at screening.

          -  Able and willing to comply with all study procedures.

          -  Screening laboratory results within normal limits or deemed not clinically significant
             by the Investigator.

             significant findings (e.g. Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome).

          -  Use of medically effective contraception with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year when
             used consistently and correctly from screening until 3 months following last dose, be

             product within 30 days preceding Day 0.

          -  Previous exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or
             receipt of an investigational product for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19,
             middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

          -  In a current occupation with high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., health care
             workers or emergency response personnel having direct interactions with or providing
             direct care to patients).

          -  Current or history of the following medical conditions:

               -  Respiratory diseases

               -  Hypersensitivity or severe allergic reactions to vaccines or drugs

               -  Cardiovascular diseases

          -  Immunosuppression as a result of underlying illness or treatment including:

               -  Primary immunodeficiencies

               -  Long term use (≥7 days) of oral or parenteral glucocorticoids

               -  Current or anticipated use of disease-modifying doses of anti-rheumatic drugs and
                  biologic disease-modifying drugs

               -  History of solid organ or bone marrow transplantation

               -  Prior history of other clinically significant immunosuppressive or clinically
                  diagnosed autoimmune disease

          -  Fewer than two acceptable sites available for intradermal (ID) injection and
             electroporation (EP) considering the deltoid and anterolateral quadriceps muscles.

          -  Reported smoking, vaping, or active drug, alcohol or substance abuse or dependence.

          -  Any physical examination findings and/or history of any illness that, in the opinion
             of the study investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose an
             additional risk to the patient by their participation in the study.
