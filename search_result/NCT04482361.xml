  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pandemic of a new coronavirus SARS-COV-2, which causes COVID-19 disease, has spread
      rapidly and is a major public health challenge. While the focus is primarily on containing
      the number of cases and finding alternative therapies, information is still lacking to
      elucidate the dynamics of viral circulation and to understand the distribution of the
      infection in the population.

      The cases reported in Argentina and worldwide could plausibly represent only a small
      proportion of the number of asymptomatic or poorly symptomatic cases that exist in society.
      However, the magnitude of this dissociation between symptomatic cases and asymptomatic
      persons is unknown.

      Knowing this information is of strategic importance as it will allow the estimation of a
      community prevalence and the evaluation of the best containment strategy. In fact, although
      all social distancing measures are now indispensable, the feasibility of prolonging the
      measure over time is a complex issue and in any case will require population-based
      information.

      The best way to approach the estimation of a true population prevalence is to take
      representative samples from the population and test them periodically. These experiences were
      carried out in other contexts showing heterogeneous results within the community studied. In
      Spain, for example, the range of antibodies present in the population varied from 1.1% to
      14.2%, also showing that an important part of the population had had contact with the virus
      without symptoms. Studies in Switzerland and the United States also show similar findings.
      However, these estimates are not automatically transferable to other settings.

      The city of Buenos Aires has a particular demographic composition with an important group of
      the population living in shantytowns (it is estimated that between 7% and 10% of the
      population lives in shantytowns) and with much heterogeneity among the different communes of
      the city. In the villas, the incidence rates of COVID-19 infection differ significantly from
      those present in the group &quot;outside the village&quot;. However, there is also an important
      difference in the incidence rates by commune, even without considering the villas.

      Thus, it is important to know the sero-epidemiology of antibodies against SARS-COV2 in a
      representative sample of the city of Buenos Aires.

      For this purpose, a nationally produced test (COVIDAR IgG) developed by professionals from
      CONICET and Instituto Leloir will be used.

      The aim of this initiative is to estimate the true dimension of the COVID-19 epidemic in the
      City of Buenos Aires, by studying the immunological status of the Buenos Aires population in
      relation to SARS-Cov2, as well as to observe the evolution of the infection among the
      population, since this information is essential to guide future public health measures
      related to the control of COVID-19.

      To achieve this objective, a comprehensive sero-epidemiological study will be carried out to
      provide estimates of past SARS-Cov2 infection with sufficient precision to be representative
      of the sero-epidemiological status of the Buenos Aires city population.

        The present study will be a transversal study carried out on 1,800 people over 18 years of
        age resident in CABA for 10 working days, between the months of July and August. The survey
        will be repeated in August and September.
