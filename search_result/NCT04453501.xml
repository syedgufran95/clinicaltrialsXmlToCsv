  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During COVID-19 epidemic, hydroxychloroquine was proposed and authorized as a possible key
      agent in the treatment of COVID-19 hospitalized pneumonia, including in France. Gautret et
      al. proposed the combination regimen with azithromycin. However only one study reported the
      interest of azithromycin alone.

      Retrospective study reporting the impact of the anti-infective agents used during the
      pandemic in a tertiary care hospital, using azithromycin with or without hydroxychloroquine.

    <description>After being admitted, patient was monitored whether he does not required to be transferred in ICU or died because of a severe COVID-19 pneumonia within 7 days. The outcome was purely clinical. If patient was discharged at home after admission and/or was transferred into a rehabilitation center he was considered as a favorable outcome independently of any biological marker.</description>
