  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether rivaroxaban reduces the risk of a composite
      endpoint of major venous and arterial thrombotic events, all-cause hospitalization, and
      all-cause mortality compared with placebo in outpatients with acute, symptomatic Coronavirus
      Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Infection.

    <description>Time to first occurrence of ISTH major bleeding will be assessed. Major bleeding is defined as clinically overt bleeding that is associated with a reduction in hemoglobin of 2 gram per deciliter (g/dL) or more, or a transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells or whole blood, or occurrence at a critical site defined as intracranial, intra-spinal, intraocular, pericardial, intra-articular, intra-muscular with compartment syndrome, retroperitoneal, or fatal outcome.</description>

             diagnostic test (example, polymerase chain reaction [PCR]). This may be nasal swab or
             saliva test or other available technology to demonstrate current infection

          -  Confirm that participant is known to health system, with at least 1 contact in
             electronic medical records (EMR) prior to screening

          -  Symptoms attributable to COVID-19 (example, fever, cough, loss of taste or smell,
             muscle aches, shortness of breath, fatigue)

          -  Initial treatment plan does not include hospitalization

          -  Presence of at least 1 additional risk factor: a) age more than or equal to (&gt;=) 60

             failure; j) body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 35 kilogram per meter
             square (kg/m^2); k) D-dimer greater than (&gt;) upper limit of normal for local
             laboratory (within 2 weeks of the date of the COVID-19 test and prior to
             randomization)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Increased risk of bleeding such as a) significant bleeding in the last 3 months; b)
             active gastroduodenal ulcer in the last 3 months; c) history of bronchiectasis or
             pulmonary cavitation; d) need for dual antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation; e)
             prior intracranial hemorrhage, f) known severe thrombocytopenia g) active cancer and
             undergoing treatment

          -  Any illness or condition that in the opinion of the investigator would significantly
             increase the risk of bleeding (example recent trauma, recent surgery, severe
             uncontrolled hypertension, gastrointestinal cancer, renal failure requiring dialysis,
             severe liver disease, known bleeding diathesis)
