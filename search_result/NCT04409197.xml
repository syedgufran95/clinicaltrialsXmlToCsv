  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During confinement, food intake can become compulsive, physical activity is significantly
      reduced, sleep is altered with exacerbated anxiety and stress levels and increased family
      violence. In some at-risk patients, mental health may even deteriorate. The temptation is
      great for all to take refuge in food or in front of screens. The main elements that can
      impact weight changes during this period of confinement are stress and anxiety, lack of
      physical activity, changes in eating habits, sleep disturbance and alcohol consumption.

      The investigators wish to study the impact of confinement on pre-post confinement weight loss
      kinetics in adults included in weight reduction programs (RNPC).
