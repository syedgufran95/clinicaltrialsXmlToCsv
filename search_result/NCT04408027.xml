  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated emergency measures (EM) have dramatically
      impacted the lives of children/adolescents (children) and families. The closure of schools,
      social and recreational activities, and modifications to work environments has led to
      significant changes in the way children and families are working, living and socializing.
      Although the impact on the mental health of children and families has not been well
      researched, it is anticipated that already stressed children and families with pre-COVID-19
      mental health challenges are at significant risk for deterioration in their mental health. As
      such, the implementation, and evaluation (specifically: feasibility, acceptability and
      barriers) of virtual-care interventions to alleviate child and family anxiety and enhance
      family functioning are critical. Virtual-care also optimizes health equity initiatives in
      reducing social, economic and environmental barriers to services that can improve or maintain
      mental health (WHO, 2017; MOHLTC, 2018).

      The current study will evaluate an adapted virtual-care cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
      program for children with anxiety (VC-CBT). CBT has a strong evidence-base in treating
      children with anxiety disorders (Higa-McMillan, Francis, Rith-Najarian, and Chorpita, 2016;
      Seligman and Ollendick, 2011), with increasing evidence supporting the efficacy of
      virtual-care CBT for childhood anxiety disorders (Carpenter, Pincus, Furr, and Comer, 2018;
      Slone, Reese, and McClellan, 2012). This study aims to evaluate the feasibility,
      participation barriers related to social determinants of health (SDH) and acceptability of
      this virtual-care intervention in addressing mental health challenges associated with the
      COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing EM in the immediate time-period. Early evaluation of this
      virtual-care intervention will enable future scale-up of this intervention during the
      post-pandemic recovery time-period and during subsequent COVID-19 waves, if necessary.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study Design: This is a pragmatic prospective pre-post feasibility study to assess whether
      virtual-care delivery of mental health interventions are acceptable and feasible with regard
      to recruitment and retention, participation barriers (inclusive of SDH barriers), child and
      parent acceptability, and adherence. Targeted symptoms of the intervention (e.g., child
      anxiety) will be evaluated as secondary outcomes to gather preliminary data on efficacy.

      Estimated Sample Size: In this first feasibility phase, participants will include children
      referred for treatment to Psychiatry. For the purpose of this pragmatic trial, we aim to
      recruit 20 participants for this intervention. According to Hertzog, a sample size of 20
      participants is adequate for pilot studies to examine intervention feasibility and to develop
      estimates of variance to compute power for larger studies (Hertzog, 2008).

      Data Analyses: Data for demographic variables will be summarized using counts, percentages,
      measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode) and measures of sample variation
      (standard deviation, range). Parametric statistics (mean, standard deviation) will be used
      for interval and ratio data. To assess the feasibility and acceptability of this
      intervention, results will include analyses of recruitment, social determinant barriers and
      adherence rates and responses to satisfaction/evaluation and alliance scales. Pre-post
      analysis will also include comparing mean changes in COVID specific distress, and
      intervention specific comparisons of child anxiety.

      Knowledge Translation: Our integrated Knowledge-to-action (iKTA) approach has involved
      family, clinician and scientist engagement from the outset and will continue to do so.
      Participants will receive updates through e-newsletters and information through email.
      Knowledge gained will be presented at conferences and publications to further the impact of
      generating future hypothesis-driven research and funding support.

    <intervention_model_description>The current study will leverage an adapted virtual-care cognitive behavioural therapy program for children with anxiety (VC-CBT). The VC-CBT protocol will involve 12 sessions (of one hour in duration) delivered by a CBT therapist using PHIPA (Personal Health Information Protection Act) compliant Zoom. An initial session will review therapy goals and psychoeducation about anxiety. Sessions 2 and 3 will focus on feeling identification and will introduce relaxation strategies. Sessions 4 and 5 will introduce cognitive distortions and restructuring strategies. Sessions 6 and 7 will introduce exposure tasks. Sessions 8 to 11 will involve practicing cognitive restructuring skills and completing exposures. The final session will review relapse prevention. Parents will participate in the first and last sessions, as well as join at the end of each session for a brief review of the skills learned during the session.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>To evaluate the efficacy of the virtual-care CBT intervention, change in child anxiety will be measured using child and parent-report Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED; Birmaher et al., 1997). The SCARED is a child and parent self-report instrument used to screen for childhood anxiety disorders including general anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, panic disorder and social phobia. In addition, it assesses symptoms related to school phobia. A total score of 25 of higher on the SCARED measure may indicate the presence of an anxiety disorder. Scores higher than 30 are more specific.</description>
