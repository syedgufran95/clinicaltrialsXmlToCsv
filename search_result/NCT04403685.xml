  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial evaluates the efficacy and safety of Tocilizumab, which rapidly reduces the
      inflammation process through inhibition of IL-6 in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19
      with increased inflammatory markers. There will be two arms in the trial, one receiving the
      best supportive care, and the other receiving it plus tocilizumab. Patients will be followed
      until Day 29 after randomization.

    <textblock>
      Coalition VI (TOCIBRÁS) is a prospective phase III randomized controlled trial that evaluates
      the efficacy and safety of Tocilizumab, an antibody anti-IL-6 receptor in patients with
      moderate to severe COVID-19 with increased inflammatory markers. This is a superiority
      open-label study with two arms. The control arm receives the best supportive care, and the
      experimental receives it plus tocilizumab. Randomization is done centrally by REDCap 1:1.
      Patients will be followed until Day 29 after randomization.
