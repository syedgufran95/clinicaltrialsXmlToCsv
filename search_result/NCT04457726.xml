  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this project is to develop an emergent treatment protocol using
      adoptive T-cell therapy for the treatment of severe COVID-19. The central hypothesis is that
      SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells from convalescent donors who have recovered from COVID-19 can be
      manufactured expeditiously and these cells are safe and effective for the treatment of severe
      SARS-CoV-2 infections.

    <textblock>
      A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of
      Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, no vaccine has been proven to be effective.
      While waiting for vaccine to be developed, passive immunity can be acquired immediately by
      adoptive transfer of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells from convalescent donors into newly infected
      patients.

      SARS-CoV-2 infections. Part Two of this project is to assess the safety and efficacy of these
      T cells in patients with COVID-19.
