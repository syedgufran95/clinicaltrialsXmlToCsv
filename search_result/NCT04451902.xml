  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a European observational cohort study (data research) involving multiple centres to
      look at the potential impact of COVID infection on patients with rare skin diseases examining
      factors such as comorbidity, protection factors, and clinical and/or therapeutic factors. The
      data collected may provide additional information on the situation of patients and, on a
      wider basis, provide useful data applicable to the general population.

      Medical and demographic data will be collected from the medical records of patients. The data
      required will be specified in Appendix 1 (collection form). Patients will be identified by
      their initials (first letter of their surname and first name); The study will last for one
      year to cover the COVID-19 epidemic in France (which includes the areas of mainland France
      and its overseas departments and territories) and in Europe, via the ERN-Skin European
      Network.

      The frequency of severe forms of COVID-19 will be calculated with a bilateral 95% confidence
      interval using, as a numerator, the number of patients with a severe form of COVID-19 and, as
      a denominator, the number of patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by PCR, chest scan,
      serological assay or by suggestive clinical signs during the medical consultation. A severe
      form of COVID is defined as a case requiring hospitalisation in an intensive care unit,
      requiring resuscitation, or resulting in death.

      Analysis of the impact of COVID-19 infection on rare skin diseases: complications, potential
      comorbidity factors, impact on the management of chronic conditions (change in treatment) and
      the experience of patients.

      The results of the analysis may be compared with those obtained for other groups of diseases.
      Gaining a better understanding of high-risk situations, as well as any aggravation or
      protective factors, should enable us to issue recommendations adapted to this kind of disease
      but that may also be useful for the general population. This type of study may also provide
      &quot;reassurance&quot; to patients with rare diseases who have many questions during this period of
      epidemic and heightened concern.

        This is a European observational cohort study (research data) involving multiple centres
        whose main objective is to determine the impact of a COVID-19 virus infection in a cohort
        of patients with rare skin diseases and particularly if these rare diseases and their
        treatments are risk factors of infection severity. The cohort of patients with rare skin
        diseases is monitored by the European Reference Network (ERN-Skin) and FIMARAD network
        centres. This is a public health impact study.
