  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if transfusion of blood plasma containing antibodies
      against COVID-19 (anti-SARS-CoV-2), which were donated from a patient who recovered from
      COVID-19 infection, is safe and can treat COVID-19 in hospitalized patients.

      Antibodies are blood proteins produced by the body in response to a virus and can remain in
      the person's bloodstream (plasma) for a long time after they recover. Transferring plasma
      from a person who recovered from COVID-19 may help neutralize the virus in sick patients'
      blood, and/or reduce the chances of the infection getting worse.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        There are 2 groups of research subjects: plasma donor and recipients

        Volunteer plasma donors can donate Convalescent Plasma if they:

          -  have adequate antibody levels against COVID-19 per FDA Guidelines

          -  have had no symptoms of COVID-19 for at least 14 days

          -  meet routine plasma donation criteria

        Inclusion Criteria for Plasma Recipients:

          -  Adults 18 years of age or older

          -  Hospitalized with PCR+ COVID-19 infection

          -  If female must not be pregnant and/or breastfeeding.

        Exclusion Criteria for Plasma Recipients:

          -  Unable to randomize patient within 14 days of admission to Stony Brook Hospital (or
             any other hospital if a transfer to Stony Brook Hospital).

          -  In the treating physician's opinion, the patient cannot tolerate a 450-550 mL infusion
             of plasma over up to 8 hours (4 hours max per unit), even if prophylaxed with
             intravenous diuretic

          -  Contraindication to transfusion or history of prior reactions to blood transfusions
