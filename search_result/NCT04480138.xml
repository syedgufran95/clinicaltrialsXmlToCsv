    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, multicenter, open-label, randomized, comparator-controlled study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of Pegylated Interferon -α2b in the treatment of adult
      patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19).Initial 1 mcg/kg of Pegylated Interferon-α2b
      will be administered on day 1. After safety evaluation of first dose, next dose (second dose)
      1 mcg/kg on day 8 will be administered with recommended standard care during the trial.
