    <textblock>
      The general aim of this study is to estimate the rate of disease progression for adults who
      seek testing and test positive for SARS-CoV-2. The primary endpoint for this study and the
      basis for sample size is hospitalization or death during the 28 day follow-up period. In some
      locations, special facilities are being built/utilized for quarantine/public health reasons
      for those who are SARS-Cov-2 positive. Hospitalization is defined as a stay for at least 18
      hours, irrespective of reason, at a hospital or one of these special facilities after study
      enrollment.

      Secondary outcomes include participant-reported health status and change in severity of
      dyspnoea.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus that emerged in China in late 2019 causing a novel Corona-Virus
      Induced Disease (COVID-19). COVID-19 is spreading rapidly throughout the world. While a
      proportion of people with COVID-19 have sufficiently severe symptoms to require
      hospitalization at the time of initial symptom onset, in others the disease may remain mild,
      and in some cases there has been observed a worsening of symptoms a few days after initial
      presentation with relatively mild symptoms. There is an urgent need for understanding the
      progression of disease for individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 who do not require
      immediate hospitalization.

      This is an international, observational cohort study of adults with SARS-CoV-2
      infection/COVID-19 who have been assessed as not requiring hospitalization (outpatients).
      This study will also be a platform for the screening of outpatients for randomized trials
      that will be conducted by the INSIGHT group.

      Adults who seek testing for SARS-CoV-2 will be screened following consent. Those with
      confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection will form an observational cohort study and be followed for 28
      days. Procedures and data collection have been streamlined to facilitate the enrollment of a
      large number of adults at INSIGHT sites around the world.

      At the time of screening, selected sites participating in a sub-study will be asked to obtain
      separate consents for 1) a nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab and a blood sample sufficient
      for four 1mL transport tubes of serum to be shipped to a central repository for future
      research on COVID-19; and 2) co-enrollment in the INSIGHT Genomics Study (INSIGHT 004) where
      a blood sample sufficient for six 1mL aliquots of whole blood will be collected. These
      specimens will be sent to a central repository in the United States for storage.
