  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open label controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the use of
      convalescent plasma in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection. This study will have
      two arms, one arm will receive convalescent plasma plus standard of care, and the other arm
      will receive standard of care only. Adults older than 18 years old, hospitalized with
      diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by a laboratory test (molecular or serology), with severe or
      life-threatening disease, will be included to the study after obtaining inform consent by the
      patient of a direct family member. Participants will be then randomized 1:1 to the
      experimental and the control groups.

      Participants at the experimental group will receive 1 to 2 units of ABO compatible COVID-19
      convalescent plasma (200 ml to 250 ml each) within 48 hours, in addition to the standard of
      care. Participants at the control group will receive standard of care. Safety of convalescent
      plasma administration will be evaluated, as well as other indicators of clinical efficacy.
