  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of APL-9 in adults with
      mild to moderate ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) caused by COVID-19 who are
      hospitalized and require supplemental oxygen therapy with or without mechanical ventilation.

      It is thought that COVID-19 activates the complement system, part of the immune system that
      responds to infection or tissue damage, and increases inflammation in the lungs. APL-9 has
      been designed to inhibit or block activation of part of the complement pathway, and
      potentially reduce inflammation in the lungs.

      Part 1 of the study is open-label to evaluate safety; all participants will receive APL-9
      plus standard of care. Part 2 of the study is double-blind, randomized; participants will
      receive either APL-9 or the vehicle-control plus standard of care.
