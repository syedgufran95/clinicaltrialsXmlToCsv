  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospital mortality attributed to SARS-CoV-2 in France increased daily by 28% in the week
      before confinement. The week following this decision, the daily increase was 30%. During the
      week of the second week of confinement, it started a decline of 19% estimated over the last 5
      days, reaching the cumulative number of 2606 deaths on 29/3 (site
      https://www.eficiens.com/coronavirus- personal statistics / and calculation).

      The diagnosis of viral carriage by RT-PCR is reserved for symptomatic cases among caregivers,
      due to the shortage of available tests and the cumbersome implementation. The carrier
      diagnosis is the benchmark, on which are implemented the therapeutic strategies and
      established the national statistics. It can present false negatives, linked to a research too
      early or too late in relation to the infection, or to a technical defect of the nasal swab
      sample. Caregivers on the front line in patient care, in hospitals or in the city, have only
      partial access to this diagnostic test, depending on the existence of symptoms. The
      implementation of a systematic serological screening, planned by the government and which
      cannot be based only on the search for the virus, will make it possible to inform the
      caregivers presenting symptoms or not, of their serological status, and therefore of their
      degree immunity or, on the contrary, susceptibility to infectious contacts. It should
      therefore be very voluntarily requested. On the occasion of this screening, the constitution
      of the COVID-3S cohort will make it possible to verify the degree of contamination in an
      asymptomatic population, information which is sorely lacking for the estimation of the immune
      coverage of the population. The implementation of the Covid-3S study will be based on the
      work of the National Reference Center of Pr B Lina, from the COVID-SER cohort, for the
      selection of the most efficient test (s). It seems useful to initiate the constitution of
      this cohort as soon as possible in relation to the evolution of the epidemic. Pending receipt
      of official recommendations, the lack of knowledge of the performance of serological tests
      means that it should be applied first to health professionals, better able to appreciate its
      limits, for the initial period before determining a validated serological screening strategy.
      Once the strategy has been specified, the gradual expansion of screening to the patient
      population will provide a more representative basis for the construction of epidemiological
      models for evaluating strategies.
