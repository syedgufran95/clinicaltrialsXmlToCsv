      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of NasoVAX in
      preventing worsening of symptoms and hospitalization in patients with early COVID-19.

      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patient volunteers that have
      given written informed consent will undergo screening to determine eligibility for study
      entry. If the patient qualifies for the study, they will be randomized in a double-blind
      manner in a 1:1 ratio to receive NasoVAX or placebo. On the same day of qualifying into the
      study, the patient will be administered the investigational drug (either NasoVAX or placebo).

      The patient will return home for the remainder of the study. During this period, the patient
      will be monitored remotely by the study center for clinical status. The patient will also be
      contacted by study center personnel by telephone to ask about use of any medications and
      changes in health including information about any hospitalization.

             degrees F), cough, or shortness of breath, onset of these symptoms within 72 hours of
             screening, and confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection by a polymerase chain reaction
             (PCR)-based or rapid antigen diagnostic.

          4. Resting SpO2 ≥ 96.0% on room air on two successive measurements

          5. For women of childbearing potential (women who are not permanently sterile [documented
             hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, salpingectomy, or oophorectomy] or
             postmenopausal [12 months with no menses without an alternative medical cause])

               -  Negative urine pregnancy test at Screening

               -  Willingness to practice a highly effective method of contraception that includes,
                  but is not limited to, abstinence, sex only with persons of the same sex,
