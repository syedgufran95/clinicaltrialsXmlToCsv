  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the study is to determine which treatments (e.g. immune modulator
      drugs) have the most favorable benefit-risk in adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19
      either diagnosed with moderate or severe pneumonia requiring no mechanical ventilation or
      critical pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation.

      The specific aims of this Covid19 cohort are to collect observational data at regular
      intervals on an ongoing basis in order to embed a series of randomized controlled trials
      evaluating a various set of interventions for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The study has
      a cohort multiple Randomized Controlled Trials (cmRCT) design.
