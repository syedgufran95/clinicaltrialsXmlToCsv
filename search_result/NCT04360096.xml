      Brief Summary:

      SARS-CoV-2 virus infection is known to cause Lung Injury that begins as dyspnea and exercise
      intolerance, but may rapidly progress to Critical COVID-19 with Respiratory Failure and the
      need for noninvasive or mechanical ventilation. Mortality rates as high as 80% have been
      reported among those who require mechanical ventilation, despite best available intensive
      care.

      Patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 by FDA definition who have not developed
      respiratory failure be treated with nebulized RLF-100 (aviptadil, a synthetic version of
      Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP)) 100 μg 3x daily plus Standard of Care vs. placebo +
      Standard of Care using an FDA 501(k) cleared mesh nebulizer.

      The primary outcome will be progression to in severity of COVID-19 (i.e. moderate progressing
      to to severe or critical OR severe progressing to critical) over 28 days. Secondary outcomes
      will include blood oxygenation as measured by pulse oximetry, dyspnea, exercise tolerance,
      and levels of TNFα IL-6 and other cytokines.

      Detailed Description:

      Attack of the Alveolar Type II (ATII) cell via its ACE2 surface receptor by the SARS-CoV-2
      virus leads to respiratory failure, morbidity, and frequently mortality in COVID-19. There is
      no approved treatment that specifically targets the pulmonary injury. Vasoactive Intestinal
      Peptide (VIP) is known to target the VPAC1 receptor of the ATII cell and to protect that cell
      against all manner of injuries, including smoke inhalation, exposure to stomach acid, and
      exposure to infectious agents. VIP prevents apoptosis, blocks cytokines, lowers TNFα levels,
      reverses CD4/CD8 ratio, and reduces cough and dyspnea in nonclinical and clinical studies.
      Aviptadil, a synthetic form of Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) has been awarded FDA
      Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of ARDS and Pulmonary Hypertension and EMEA Orphan
      Drug Designation for the treatment of ARDS and Sarcoid. RLF-100 (Aviptadil) has been granted
      FDA Fast Track Designation for the treatment of ARDS/Acute Lung Injury in COVID-19.

      The objective of this study is to identify patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 who
      have not yet developed respiratory failure and to treat them with inhaled Vasoactive
      Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) in the hope of preventing progression to Critical COVID-19 with
      Respiratory Failure.

      Nonclinical studies demonstrate that VIP is 70% concentrated in the lung, where it binds
      primarily to ATII cells. VIP prevents NMDA-induced caspase-3 activation in the lung, inhibits
      IL6 and TNFα production, protects against HCl-induced pulmonary edema, These and other
      effects have been observed in numerous animal model systems of lung injury in mice, rats,
      guinea pigs, sheep, swine, and dogs. In these models, Aviptadil restores barrier function at
      the endothelial/alveolar interface and thereby protects the lung and other organs from
      failure.

      Both intravenous and inhalation preclinical toxicology and safety pharmacology have been
      performed in four species, with a six month trial of inhaled RLF-100 in primates.

      Aviptadil is approved for human use in Europe and has a demonstrated 20 year history of
      safety in numerous trials for Sarcoid, Pulmonary Fibrosis, Bronchospasm, Erectile
      Dysfunction, and a phase I trial in ARDS. In that phase I trial, 8 patients with severe ARDS
      on mechanical ventilation were treated with ascending doses of VIP. Seven of the 8 patients
      were successfully extubated and were alive at the five day timepoint. Six left the hospital
      and one died of an unrelated cardiac event.

      Five GCP phase 2 trials of RLF-100 have been conducted under European regulatory authority.
      Non GCP healthy volunteer studies have shown that i.v. infusion of Aviptadil is well
      tolerated with few adverse effects including alterations in blood pressure, heart rate, or
      ECG. In addition to published studies of human use, Aviptadil has been used on a compounded
      basis in certain ICUs for many years in the belief that it preserves life and restores
      function in pulmonary hypertension, ARDS, and Acute Lung Injury (ALI).

      In this study, patients patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 by FDA definition who have
      not developed respiratory failure be treated with nebulized RLF-100 100 μg 3x daily plus
      Standard of Care vs. placebo + Standard of Care using an FDA 501(k) cleared mesh nebulizer.

      The primary outcome will be progression to in severity of COVID-19 (i.e. moderate progressing
      to to severe or critical OR severe progressing to critical) over 28 days. Secondary outcomes
      will include blood oxygenation as measured by pulse oximetry, dyspnea, exercise tolerance,
      and levels of TNFα IL-6 and other cytokines.
