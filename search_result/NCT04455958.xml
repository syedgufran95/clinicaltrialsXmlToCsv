  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well lopinavir/ritonavir works in treating COVID-19 positive
      patients with cancer and a weakened immune system (immune-suppression) in the last year and
      have mild or moderate symptoms caused by COVID-19. Lopinavir/ritonavir may help to lessen or
      prevent COVID-19 symptoms from getting worse in cancer patients.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine if treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir will decrease progression of symptoms
      compared to control/placebo.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if treatment improves time to symptom resolution. II. Determine the time to
      symptom progression. III. Determine time to improvement of participants as defined by
      complete resolution of symptoms.

      IV. Determine the proportion of participants who have severe or critical symptoms and
      hospital admission.

      V. Determine the time to hospital admission for those who develop severe of critical symptoms
      VI. Determine the proportion of participants with an intensive care unit (ICU) admission.

      VII. Determine the proportion of participants receiving ventilator support. VIII. Determine
      survival of participants enrolled on the study.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. For patients admitted to the hospital, will determine the following parameters: potassium
      level, blood oxygen level, creatinine, and blood pressure.

      II. Identify obstacles and barriers encountered while implementing a clinical trial in the
      context of a pandemic caused by a contagious disease and associated social distancing.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive lopinavir/ritonavir orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 14 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II: Patients receive placebo PO BID for 14 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up 3 times a week until symptoms
      resolve plus 2 additional weeks thereafter, for up to 3 months, whichever occurs first.

          -  Participants with abnormal blood counts (white blood cell [WBC], platelet, hemoglobin
             [Hg]) will not be excluded

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has any other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions
             that would, in the investigator's judgment, may cause unacceptable safety risks,
             contraindicate patient participation in the clinical study or compromise compliance
             with the protocol

          -  Participants receiving any contraindicated medication that in the opinion of the
             investigator cannot be continued while receiving study drug and cannot be held for the

          -  History of unstable cardiac disease in the past 6 months

          -  History of prolonged QT interval, or on other cardiac medications known to prolong the
             QT interval

          -  Use of strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 is prohibited. Lopinavir/ritonavir
             (L/R) is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Therefore, concomitant use of strong
             inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir,
             nelfinavir and saquinavir), and inducers of CYP3A (e.g. rifampin, phenytoin,
             carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John's wort) are not permitted. The use of other
             herbals will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. If they are deemed to be strong
             modulators of CYP3A4, patients will be excluded if they are unable or unwilling to
             stop taking them

          -  Women who plan to breast feed while on this study are not eligible for participation
             due to the potential for unnecessary adverse event risks to a child
