  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators propose to analyse the clinical data of all patients
      admitted in Geneva University Hospitals (HUG) or in a care center in Geneva who are diagnosed
      with COVID-19. CVD being one of the most important risk factors for developing a severe form
      of the disease, the investigators will explore the prognosis and clinical outcomes of those
      patients according to their CVD history as well as newly onset CVD during hospitalization.
      Moreover, as further evidence is needed on the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
      (RAAS) inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, the investigators will study prognosis
      and outcomes according to the patients' medications. Finally, the investigators propose to
      evaluate hospital length of stay and cost. The aim, therefore, is to collect information and
      scientific evidence from patients hospitalized and diagnosed positive for COVID-19, in order
      to evaluate if previous (or newly onset) CVD may influence outcomes and costs.

      Hypothesis:

      COVID-19+ hospitalized patients with preexisting CVD or newly onset CVD at time of
      hospitalization have different clinical outcomes compared to those without CVD and COVID-19+.

      Objectives:

      The primary aim of this study is to gather observational data, starting from February 1st
      2020 until the end of the pandemic, to compare clinical outcomes COVID+ hospitalized patients
      at HUG or in a care center in Geneva with pre-existing or newly onset CVD, to COVID+
      hospitalized patients at HUG or in a care center in Geneva without pre-existing CVD.

      The secondary aims of this study are:

        -  To determine the association between COVID-19 disease and CVD, based on: age, previous
           CV diseases, CV risks factors, CV medications (e.g. ACE Inhibitors or angiotensin II
           receptor antagonists)

        -  To explore CVD profiles that may influence COVID-19 disease outcomes

        -  To determine the cause of death in CVD patients (either with preexisting CVD or newly
           diagnosed with CVD)

        -  To understand the vulnerability of the myocardium (new event of either heart failure,
           acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmia, myocarditis) in patients with COVID-19 disease.
