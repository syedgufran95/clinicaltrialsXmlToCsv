    <textblock>
      Currently, no effective treatments are available for the COVID-19. Scientists and Researchers
      are working on many aspects of treatment options for the development of vaccination and
      medication to combat this life-threatening problem. Convalescent plasma from recovered
      COVID-19 patients contains antibodies against COVID-19 which may be beneficial to severely
      sick COVID-19 patients. Investigator have recently concluded a pilot phase II open-label RCT
      on the efficacy of convalescent plasma in severe COVID 19 patients in which encouraging
      results were seen. Investigator plan to further study the efficacy and safety of convalescent
      plasma in COVID-19 severely sick patients through an RCT. Investigator will collect up to 500
      ml Convalescent Plasma from the COVID-19 recovered persons after 14 days of clinical recovery
      with two consecutive SARS CoV-2 negative tests by PCR at least 24 hours apart. This plasma
      will be tested and frozen and stored. On requisition it will be thawed and sent to the
      treating center. Two doses of 250 ml convalescent plasma each will be transfused on two
      consecutive days to patients who fit the eligibility criteria (Severely sick COVID-19
      patients) and are randomized to the convalescent plasma group along with the standard of care
      and the other group will receive standard of care alone. Data will be collected to study the
      benefits and adverse events related to convalescent plasma transfusion.

      against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (receptor binding domain) proteins. The titre will be done by IgG
      ELISA or by Rapid IgG antibody titre. The minimum titre of 80 is needed for the use of
      convalescent in patients.

      For recipients:

        1. Real-time PCR for SARS-CoV-2:

           Nasal swab samples will be taken prior to transfusion and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by
           real-time PCR method. The test should be positive for eligibility of the recipient along
           with clinical criteria for COVID-19.

        2. Antibody titre: The serum of each recipient will be obtained and IgG antibody titre by
           enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA) or Rapid IgG antibody method will be tested
           one day prior to the convalescent plasma transfusion. Changes of IgG antibody titre
           before and after convalescent plasma transfusion in patients will be studied. The serum
