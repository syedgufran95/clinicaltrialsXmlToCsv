  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The C-MORE study is prospective observational holistic longitudinal study which will
      characterise the prevalence of multi-organ injury among COVID-19 survivors post hospital
      discharge and assess its effects on quality of life, exercise tolerance and mental health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), hundreds of thousands of lives have
      been lost and millions significantly affected. Although primarily a respiratory viral
      illness, emerging data suggests that multiorgan involvement is common in those with
      moderate-severe infections. Whether or not persistent multiorgan damage will be seen in
      COVID-19 survivors is unknown.

      C-MORE is an observational study that aims to investigate the long-term effects of COVID-19
      on the lungs, heart, brain, liver and kidneys using advanced state-of-the art magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) technology. The study will assess 616 patients with
      laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from leading UK centres and undertake multi-organ magnetic
      resonance imaging at 3, 6, and 12 months following the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. In
      addition, assessments of breathing, exercise capacity, cognition and mental health will be
      carried out.

      The study will describe the prevalence of persistent multi-organ injury in COVID-19 patients
      and assess how this relates to comorbid conditions, severity of acute respiratory illness,
      immunological response, genetic factors, quality of life and mental health.
