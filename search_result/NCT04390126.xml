  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The containment associated with the VIDOC-19 pandemic creates an unprecedented societal
      situation of physical and social isolation. Our hypothesis is that in patients with chronic
      diseases, confinement leads to changes in health behaviours, adherence to pharmacological
      treatment, lifestyle rules and increased psychosocial stress with an increased risk of
      deterioration in their health status in the short, medium and long term.

      Some messages about the additional risk/danger associated with taking certain drugs in the
      event of COVID disease have been widely disseminated in the media since March 17, 2020, the
      date on which containment began in France. This is the case, for example, for
      corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs but also for converting enzyme
      inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARBs2). These four major
      classes of drugs are widely prescribed in patients with chronic diseases, diseases
      specifically selected in our study (corticosteroids: haematological malignancies, multiple
      sclerosis, Horton's disease; ACE inhibitors/ARAs2: heart failure, chronic coronary artery
      disease). Aspirin used at low doses as an anti-platelet agent in coronary patients as a
      secondary prophylaxis after a myocardial infarction can be stopped by some patients who
      consider aspirin to be a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Discontinuation of this
      antiplatelet agent, which must be taken for life after an infarction, exposes the patient to
      a major risk of a new cardiovascular event.

      The current difficulty of access to care due to travel restrictions (a theoretical limit in
      the context of French confinement but a priori very real), the impossibility of consulting
      overloaded doctors, or the cancellation of medical appointments, medical and surgical
      procedures due to the reorganization of our hospital and private health system to better
      manage COVID-19 patients also increases the risk of worsening the health status of chronic
      patients who by definition require regular medical monitoring.

      Eight Burgundian cohorts of patients with chronic diseases (chronic coronary artery disease,
      heart failure, multiple sclerosis, Horton's disease, AMD, haemopathic malignancy, chronic
      respiratory failure (idiopathic fibrosis, PAH) haemophilia cohort) will study the health
      impact of the containment related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
