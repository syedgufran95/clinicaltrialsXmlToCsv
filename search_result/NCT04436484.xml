  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new virus to humans, first identified in December 2019, is causing a global pandemic with
      over 1 million infections and many thousands of deaths. The virus, SARS-CoV2, leads to
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which mainly affects the breathing system. Around 1 in
      every 5 people with COVID-19 have more severe infection needing treatment in hospital. Up to
      half of them require help with breathing in an intensive care unit. Information we have so
      far about COVID-19 suggests that people with underlying conditions, such as high blood
      pressure and heart disease, or older people are at higher risk of having severe illness.
      Scientists do not yet understand why but think it may be related to the immune system.

      SARS-CoV2 activates the immune system causing inflammation in the lungs, which is also seen
      in circulating immune cells in the blood. Preliminary reports show that the response of the
      immune system can be inappropriate, both overactive and also poorly responsive (exhausted).
      Changes in the type and function of immune cells have been linked to increased risk of severe
      disease or death from COVID-19.

      In this study, the investigators will look for markers of immune function when a person first
      attends hospital, which can be used to predict whether they will go on to have a more severe
      infection. This will help treat patients more effectively, for example, by moving high risk
      patients to an intensive care setting at an early stage. The team will investigate the immune
      system in detail in 200 patients with COVID-19 attending University Hospitals Plymouth. The
      investigators will look for changes in the number, type and function of circulating immune
      cells and measure whether these changes are linked to severity of the infection or death. The
      investigators will use established techniques to measure immune function that could be
      rapidly put into routine hospital care to help guide treatment for individual patients.
