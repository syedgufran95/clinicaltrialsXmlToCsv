      PHENOTYPE is an investigator-led, observational cohort study which aims to explore the
      long-term outcomes of patients with COVID-19 infection and to identify potential risk factors
      and biomarkers that can prognosticate disease severity and trajectory.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in Wuhan, China. SARS-CoV-2
      infection, denominated COVID-19, causes a predominantly respiratory illness, which varies
      from mild respiratory symptoms to multi-organ failure and death. In March 2020, COVID-19 was
      designated pandemic status and as of May 2020 there have been more than 3.7 million cases
      reported worldwide and 257,000 deaths attributed. In the UK, COVID-19 has caused more than
      30,000 deaths to date.

      Although respiratory symptoms are the commonest presentation, numerous systemic complications
      of COVID-19 have been identified, including those affecting the cardiovascular, neurological,
      gastroenterological, and renal systems. The long-term impact of these complications on
      survivors and the risk factors for long term sequelae is not presently known. It is likely
      that increased frailty and psychological sequelae will be significant, which could lead to a
      persistent reduction in quality of life, as observed in the previous SARS pandemic.

      This cohort study aims to evaluate the respiratory, cardiac, renal and psychological outcomes
      of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection and determine the pathophysiological mechanisms
      that contribute to disease severity and disease burden.
