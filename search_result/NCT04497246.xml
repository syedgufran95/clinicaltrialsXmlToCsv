  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the last coronavirus discovered, called
      SARS-CoV-2. Symptoms encountered in COVID-19 are: cough, breathing difficulties (dyspnea,
      chest pain, etc.), pyrexia, anosmia (loss of smell) and/or dysgeusia (loss of taste), but
      also ENT symptoms (rhinitis type, odynophagia), headaches, asthenia, muscle pain, confusion
      and diarrhea. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can also be asymptomatic. COVID-19 can be passed from
      person to person by respiratory droplets expelled when a person speaks, coughs or sneezes.
      The currently estimated incubation period ranges from 1 to 14 days, and most often this is
      around 5 days.

      According to a literature review, there is strong evidence that COVID-19 has an impact on
      mental health (anxiety being the most common symptom) whether in the general population,
      healthcare workers or vulnerable populations. The objective of this project is to assess
      mental health and sleep disorders within two populations: elderly patients and nursing staff.

    <measure>Impact Event Scale-Revised (IES-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The IES-R is a 22-item self-report measure that assesses subjective distress caused by traumatic events.Items are rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;extremely&quot;). The IES-R yields a total score (ranging from 0 to 88) and subscale scores can also be calculated for the Intrusion, Avoidance, and Hyperarousal subscales.</description>

    <measure>Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Self-administered patient questionnaire used as a screening tool and severity measure for generalised anxiety disorder (GAD).The GAD-7 score is calculated by assigning scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, to the response categories of 'not at all', 'several days', 'more than half the days', and 'nearly every day', respectively, and adding together the scores for the seven questions. Scores of 5, 10, and 15 are taken as the cut-off points for mild, moderate and severe anxiety, respectively. When used as a screening tool, further evaluation is recommended when the score is 10 or greater.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the nine DSM-IV criteria as &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day). It has been validated for use in primary care. It is not a screening tool for depression but it is used to monitor the severity of depression and response to treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Insomnia severity index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The ISI is a 7-item self-report questionnaire assessing the nature, severity, and impact of insomnia.The dimensions evaluated are: severity of sleep onset, sleep maintenance, and early morning awakening problems, sleep dissatisfaction, interference of sleep difficulties with daytime functioning, noticeability of sleep problems by others, and distress caused by the sleep difficulties. A 5-point Likert scale is used to rate each item (e.g., 0 = no problem; 4 = very severe problem), yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 28. The total score is interpreted as follows: absence of insomnia (0-7); sub-threshold insomnia (8-14); moderate insomnia (15-21); and severe insomnia (22-28).</description>
