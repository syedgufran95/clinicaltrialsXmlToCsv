      Abstract The objective of this study is to review, through prospective case research, the
      efficacy of oral chlorine dioxide in the treatment of patients with COVID infection 19. The
      research will be carried out between April and June 2020 with a quasi-experimental design in
      two health care centers on a sample of twenty (20) patients, through direct intervention, who
      will measure the changes in the manifest symptoms of infection and negativity. a COVID 19
      after administration of the study preparation, to determine the effectiveness of chlorine
      dioxide in the treated group.

      Based on the results that are found and on the evaluation of efficacy on the basis of
      clinical improvement on a scale of 1 to 5, and of the negativization of COVID 19, we can
      conclude whether the therapeutic efficacy in this investigation is considered good by
      verifying whether or not there is efficacy of treatment with chlorine dioxide in COVID 19.

      With this research, it is hoped to stimulate the search for new therapeutic options in the
      treatment of COVID 19 and contribute to the development of NEW options in medications,
      considering the immense number of deaths and morbidity that currently exists in the present
      pandemic.

      Introduction The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) is responding to an
      outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a new coronavirus that was first detected in China
      and has now been detected in almost 90 locations worldwide, including in the United States.
      The virus has been termed &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot; and the disease causing it has been termed
      &quot;coronavirus disease 2019&quot; (abbreviated &quot;COVID-19&quot;).

      The current covid19 pandemic is a situation that: is severe, unusual, or unexpected; it has
      implications for public health beyond the national border of the affected State; and requires
      immediate international action.

      For the same reason, it is urgent to look for routes that can contribute something new,
      hopefully fast, effective and economic that will solve or mitigate the current pandemic.

      In this work we will use the bases of translational medicine to bring conventional medicine,
      studies and treatment that are born from the terrain of diverse therapeutic possibilities.

      PROBLEM STATEMENT

      Description of the problem Covid-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
      It was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan (Hubei province) in December 2019. In
      three months it spread to practically every country in the world, which is why the World
      Health Organization declared it a pandemic.

      There is no known effective treatment for the disease. The WHO recommends that randomized
      controlled trials be conducted with volunteers to test the effectiveness and safety of some
      potential treatments.

      Based on this, we look at research processes given in the past to carry out (initial
      translational medicine) those promising and initial observations in infectious treatment to
      covid treatment 19 .

      Delimitation of the Problem it was considered that the research that could really contribute
      to addressing the problem previously raised, should be directed to the development of a drug
      proposal of therapeutic possibilities studied in the past, based on both conventional and
      unconventional research.

      General and specific research objectives

      General purpose :

      To determine the effectiveness of oral chlorine dioxide in the treatment of COVID 19

      Specific objectives :

        1. Measure the positivity or negativity of COVID 19 in patients who received treatment with
           chlorine dioxide.

        2. Determine the clinical improvement based on the VAS visual scale.

      Expected results :

      What is expected is to reduce morbidity and especially mortality from viral infection of
      COVID, through management with chlorine dioxide.

      Research Question

      In this way, starting from the delimitation of the problem, the following research question
      is posed:

      Could the use of chlorine dioxide modify morbidity and mortality in patients infected with
      COVID 19?

      JUSTIFICATION Given the avalanche of deaths caused by the coronavirus in the absence of truly
      effective treatment, we have developed a protocol for dealing with COVID infection,
      particularly in hospitalized patients and in the ICU, with the aim of trying to reduce the
      morbidity and mortality of the Viral infection.

      , we recommend a complementary experimental and exploratory approach that seeks to reduce the
      destructive and fibrotic effects of the process , as well as the storm. leukocyte and
      antiphospholipid syndrome that occurs in many cases and in other cases prevent, while
      reducing, the recovery times of patients.

      State of the art at the international level in research treatments against coronavirus •
      Vaccines Three vaccination strategies are being investigated. First, the researchers aim to
      build a complete virus vaccine. T. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a
      vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain virus subunits. . A third strategy is
      nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a novel technique for creating a vaccine).
      Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies would have to be tested for safety and
      efficacy. It is likely to take months to a year to achieve a truly efficient vaccine. The
      mutagenicity of the virus makes it difficult.

      Antivirals On January 23, Gilead Sciences was in communication with researchers and
      physicians in the United States and China about the ongoing outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus
      and the potential use of Remdesivir as an investigational treatment.

      In late January, the Russian Ministry of Health identified three adult medications that could
      help treat the disease. They are ribavirin, lopinavir / ritonavir, and interferon beta-1b.
      These drugs are commonly used to treat hepatitis C, HIV infection, and multiple sclerosis,
      respectively. The ministry provided Russian hospitals with descriptions and guides on the
      mechanism of action of the treatment and the recommended doses. In February, China started
      using triazavirin, a 2014 drug developed in Russia, with the aim of testing whether it is
      effective in controlling the disease. This drug was created at the Ural Federal University in
      Yekaterinburg to treat H5N1 flu (avian flu). It has been used against COVID-19 due to the
      similarity between the two diseases. On March 18 an article reports that lopinavir /
      ritonavir treatment is negative in clinical trials with 199 patients in China. There are no
      benefits.

      Chinese researchers discovered that Arbidol, an antiviral drug used to Treating the flu could
      be combined with Darunavir, a medicine used in the treatment of HIV, to treat patients with
      coronavirus.

      Chloroquine phosphate has shown apparent efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 associated
      pneumonia. In clinical trials with 100 patients, it was found to be superior to control
      treatment to inhibit exacerbation of pneumonia, improve lung imaging findings, promote
      negative virus conversion, and shorten disease. chloroquine could prevent orf1ab, ORF3a, and
      ORF10 from attacking heme to form porphyrin, and inhibit the binding of ORF8 and surface
      glycoproteins to porphyrins to some extent.

      The National Center for Biotechnology Development of China stated on March 17 that the
      antiviral Favipiravir, an RNA polymerase inhibitor, showed positive results in a case-control
      study of 80 patients at Shenzhen People's Hospital No. 3, The who received Favipiravir
      treatment tested negative within a shorter period of time compared to the control group, and
      recommends that it be included in treatment.

      Hydroxychloroquine, a less toxic derivative of chloroquine, would be more potent in
      inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. On March 16, 2020, a leading French authority and
      French Government advisor on COVID-19, Professor Didier Raoult of the Instituto University
      Hospital Institute of Infectious Diseases (IHU-Méditerranée infection) in Marseille
      (Bouches-du-Rhône, Provence-Alpes-Côte d 'Azur), announced that a trial with 24 patients from
      southeastern France had shown that chloroquine is a treatment effective for COVID-19. 600 mg
      of hydroxychloroquine (brand name Plaquenil) were administered to these patients every day
      for 10 days.

        -  Against the cytokine storm Tocilizumab has been included in the treatment guidelines by
           the China National Health Commission after a small study was completed. In combination
           with an analysis of Serum ferritin blood to identify cytokine storms is intended to
           counteract such developments, which are believed to be the cause of death in some
           affected individuals. The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA for
           treatment of cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy,
           in 2017.

        -  Passive antibody therapy The use of blood donations from healthy people who have already
           recovered from COVID-19 is being investigated, a strategy that has also been tested for
           SARS, a previous cousin of COVID-19. The mechanism of action is that antibodies
           naturally produced in the immune system of those who have already recovered are
           transferred to people who need them through a non-vaccine-based form of immunization.

      Vir Biotechnology, based in San Francisco, is evaluating the effectiveness of previously
      identified monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the virus.

      Researchers from Utrecht University and Erasmus MC announced that they found a human
      monoclonal antibody that blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      A systematic search of the use of chlorine dioxide in the international bibliography for
      indexed literature was made .The most significant findings in the bibliography referenced
      above is that they are focused on disinfection of areas, use in oral health, use in agronomy
      and a phase 1 study in rats with Influenza A-induced infection in two groups, one treated
      with chlorine dioxide and the other without chlorine dioxide.

      THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK CHLORINE DIOXIDE AND THE BASES OF ITS THERAPEUTIC APPLICATION

      The therapeutic action of chlorine dioxide is given by its selectivity for pH. It means that
      this molecule dissociates and releases oxygen when it comes in contact with another acid.
      When reacting, it is converted to sodium chloride (common salt) and at the same time it
      releases oxygen, which in turn oxidizes (combusts) the pathogens (harmful germs) of acidic
      pH, converting them into alkaline oxides (&quot;ashes&quot;). Therefore, as chlorine dioxide
      dissociates, it releases oxygen in the blood, as do erythrocytes (red blood cells) through
      the same principle (known as the Bohr effect), which is to be selective for acidity. Like
      blood, chlorine dioxide releases oxygen when it encounters acidity, either from lactic acid
      or from the acidity of the pathogen. Its therapeutic effect is due, among others, to the fact
      that it helps in the recovery of many types of diseases, creating an alkaline environment, at
      the same time eliminating small acid pathogens, in my opinion, through oxidation, with an
      impossible electromagnetic overload to dissipate by unicellular organisms.

      Multicellular tissue has the ability to dissipate this charge and is not affected in the same
      way.

      Biochemistry, in turn, defines cell protection through hydrogen sulfide groups. Chlorine
      dioxide, which is the second strongest disinfectant known after ozone, is much more indicated
      for therapeutic use since it is also capable of penetrating and eliminating biofilm,
      something that ozone does not do. The great advantage of the therapeutic use of Chlorine
      dioxide is the impossibility of bacterial resistance to ClO2. Chlorine dioxide is a selective
      oxidant and unlike other substances it does not react with most components of living tissue.
      Chlorine dioxide does react quickly with phenols and thyroles essential for bacterial life.
      In phenols, the mechanism is to attack the benzene ring, eliminating odor, taste and other
      intermediate compounds. Chlorine dioxide removes viruses effectively and is up to 10 times
      more effective Evaluation of the antiviral activity of chlorine dioxide against feline
      calicivirus, human influenza virus, measlesvirus, canine distemper virus, human herpesvirus,
      human adenovirus, canine adenovirus and canine parvovirus. It also proved to be highly
      effective against small parasites, the protozoa.

      A subject of great concern to medical professionals in medical scientific terms is the
      reactivity of chlorine dioxide with essential amino acids. In some tests on the reactivity of
      chlorine dioxide with 21 essential amino acids, only cysteine , Tryptophan and tyrosine ,
      proline and hydroxyproline were reactive at a pH around 6. . These amino acids are relatively
      easy to replace.

      Cysteine and Methionine . Oxidation by chlorine dioxide of methionine and cysteine
      derivatives to sulfoxide they are two aromatic amino acids that contain sulfide, tryptophan
      and tyrosine and the 2 inorganic ions FE2 + and Mn2 +. Cysteine, due to its membership in the
      thiol group, is an amino acid up to 50 times more reactive with all microbe systems than the
      other four essential amino acids, and therefore unable to create resistance against chlorine
      dioxide. Although it is not scientifically proven to date, pharmacodynamics usually assumes
      that the cause of its antimicrobial effect is due to its reactions to the four amino acids
      listed above or to protein and peptide residues.

        1. Chlorine dioxide is a yellow gas that dissolves easily in water, without altering its
           structure.

        2. It is obtained by mixing sodium chlorite and dilute hydrochloric acid.

      2. The chlorine dioxide gas dissolved in water is an oxidant 3. Chlorine dioxide is pH
      selective and the more acidic the pathogen, the stronger the reaction.

      4. According to toxicological studies by the EPA (US Environmental Protection Agency),
      chlorine dioxide does not leave residues, nor does it accumulate in the body in the long
      term.

      5. In the oxidation process it is converted to oxygen and sodium chloride (common salt).

      CHLORINE DIOXIDE AND THE BASES OF ITS THERAPEUTIC APPLICATION IN CORONAVIRUSES Chlorine
      dioxide (ClO 2) has been used for over 100 years to fight all kinds of bacteria, viruses, and
      fungi. It acts as a disinfectant, since in its mode of action it turns out to be an oxidant.
      It closely resembles the way our own body works, for example in phagocytosis, where an
      oxidation process is used to eliminate all kinds of pathogens. Chlorine dioxide (ClO 2) is a
      yellowish gas that, to date, has not been introduced into the conventional pharmacopoeia as
      an active ingredient, although it is compulsory used to disinfect and preserve blood bags for
      transfusions. It is also used in the majority of bottled waters suitable for consumption,
      since it leaves no toxic residues; in addition to being a very soluble gas in water and that
      evaporates from 11 ºC.

      The recent pandemic of the Covid-19 coronavirus demands urgent solutions with an approach
      with all possible approaches, whether conventional or alternative. In previous
      investigations, chlorine dioxide (ClO 2) in aqueous solution at low doses eliminated this
      virus.

      The approach is as follows: on the one hand we know that viruses are absolutely sensitive to
      oxidation and therefore, it is used in human blood bags against viruses such as HIV and
      studies in rats reveal that it completely controls virus infections Influenza A, it is
      proposed that it should also act on SARS -Cov -2.

      Base proposals for mechanisms of action in COVID 19

        1. Chlorine dioxide removes viruses through the selective oxidation process in a very short
           time. It does this by denaturing the capsid proteins, and subsequently oxidizes the
           genetic material of the virus, disabling it. A completely new approach that has been
           studied by Andreas Ludwig Kalcker, one of the members of this research team, for more
           than thirteen years with the result of three pharmaceutical patents for parenteral use.
           It can be produced by any pharmacy as a master preparation and has been used in a
           similar way to (DAC N-055) in the old German Drug Code as &quot;Natrium Chlorosum&quot; since
           1990.

           Until now solutions have been proposed that result in extremely slow processes, and
           given the rate of attack of the virus, we must try to use the fastest and most
           expeditious routes possible. The great advantage of chlorine dioxide is that it works
           for any viral subspecies and there are no possible resistances to this type of
           oxidation. Let's not forget that this substance has been used for 100 years in
           wastewater without generating any type of resistance.

        2. There is already scientific evidence that chlorine dioxide is effective in SARS-CoV-2
           coronaviruses, It has also been shown to be effective in human coronavirus and in
           animals such as dogs, known as canine respiratory coronavirus, or in cats, including
           feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and the better known virus of feline infectious
           peritonitis (FIPV), since it denatures the capsids by oxidation inactivating the virus
           in a short time .

      It should be noted that chlorine dioxide to ingest is a completely new antiviral approach as
      it is an oxidant and can eliminate by combustion any subspecies or mutant variant of virus.
      Given the emergency situation in which we currently find ourselves with Covid-19, the oral
      use of ClO2 is proposed immediately through a protocol already known and used.

      2. Toxicity: The biggest problems that arise with medications in general are due to their
      toxicity and side effects. New studies demonstrate its viability. Although the toxicity of
      chlorine dioxide in case of massive inhalation is known, there is no clinically proven death
      even at high doses by oral ingestion. The lethal dose (LD50, acute toxicity ratio) is
      considered to be 292 mg per kilogram for 14 days, where its equivalent in a 50 kg adult would
      be 15,000 mg administered for two weeks of a gas dissolved in water (something almost
      impossible). The oral sub-toxic doses used are around 50 mg dissolved in 100 ml of water 10
      times a day, which is equivalent to 0.5 g daily (and, therefore, only 1/30 of the LD50 of 15
      g of ClO2 per day).

      Chlorine dioxide dissociates, breaks down in the human body in a few hours into a negligible
      amount of common salt (NaCL) and oxygen (O2) within the human body. Furthermore, measurements
      of venous blood gases have indicated that it is capable of substantially improving the lung
      oxygenation capacity of the affected patient.

      OPERATION CHLORINE DIOXIDE AGAINST VIRUSES As a general rule, most viruses behave similarly
      and once they bind to the appropriate host type - bacteria or cell, as the case may be - the
      nucleic acid component that the virus introduces takes over after protein synthesis processes
      in the infected cell. Certain segments of the viral nucleic acid are responsible for the
      replication of the genetic material of the capsid. In the presence of these nucleic acids,
      the CLO2 molecule becomes unstable and dissociates, releasing the resulting oxygen to the
      medium, which in turn helps to oxygenate the surrounding tissue, increasing the mitochondrial
      activity and, therefore, the response of the immune system. Nucleic acids, DNA-RNA, consist
      of a chain of puric and pyrimidine bases, see: guanine (G), cytosine (C), adenine (A) and
      thymine (T). It is the sequence of these four units along the chain that makes one segment
      different from another. The guanine base, which is found in both RNA and DNA, is very
      sensitive to oxidation, forming 8-oxoguanin as a by-product of it. Therefore, when the CLO2
      molecule comes in contact with guanine and oxidizes it, it leads to the formation of
      8-oxoguanin, thus blocking viral nucleic acid replication by base pairing. Although the
      replication of the protein capsid may continue; Fully functional virus formation is blocked
      by oxidation thanks to CLO2.

      The CLO2 molecule has characteristics that make it an ideal candidate for treatment in the
      clinical setting, since it is a product with a high selective oxidation power and a great
      capacity to reduce acidosis, increasing oxygen in the tissues and mitochondria, thus
      facilitating the rapid recovery of patients with lung diseases.

      POSSIBLE PRECAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS Chlorine dioxide reacts with antioxidants and
      various acids, so the use of vitamin C or ascorbic acid is not recommended during treatment,
      as it nullifies the effectiveness of chlorine dioxide in the elimination of pathogens (the
      antioxidant effect of one prevents the selective oxidation of the other.) Therefore, it is
      not advisable to take antioxidants during the days of treatment. Stomach acid has been shown
      not to affect its effectiveness. In patients with Warfarin treatment, they should constantly
      check the values to avoid cases of overdose, as chlorine dioxide has been shown to improve
      blood flow. Although chlorine dioxide is very soluble in water, it has the advantage that it
      does not hydrolyze, so it does not generate toxic carcinogenic THM (trihalomethanes) such as
      chlorine. It also does not cause genetic mutations or malformations.

      HYPOTHESIS Orally administered chlorine dioxide eliminates COVID infection 19. METHODOLOGY
      TYPE OF STUDY Observational, prospective, quasi-experimental study of a group of cases.
      Characteristics of our study: Like quasi-experimental studies, it is used, particularly, to
      determine the effect of treatments or interventions. It has two basic characteristics: the
      first, it does not require the randomization procedure for the formation of the study and
      control groups; the second may or may not have control groups. This quasi-experimental study
      offers an adequate level of internal and external validity. In addition, we will use time
      series without a control group, based on a single group that serves as study and control.
      Once established, periodic measurements of the dependent variable are carried out, then the
      treatment is applied and subsequently the dependent variable continues to be measured
      periodically.

        The population to which the study was directed consisted of a group of patients of medical
        and health profession with active infection with COVID-19, from various medical care
        centers, hospitals, in the city of Bogotá, Colombia and Madrid, Spain (multicenter .) The
        selection of the patients was made based on the self-proposal of the doctors / patients as
        candidates for research, which refers to the fact that they proposed themselves as cases.
        Similarly, simultaneity was applied, which means that the patients were obtained in the
        same period of time in which the cases arose.
