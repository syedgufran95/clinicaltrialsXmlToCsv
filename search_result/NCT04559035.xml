  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if using nasal irrigation, also known as nasal
      lavage, for 14 days after a positive test can reduce the severity of symptoms associated with
      COVID-19. Nasal lavage consists of running salt water in one nostril and out the other to get
      rid of germs. Nasal irrigation will be done with either Betadine or baking soda to determine
      if adding an antimicrobial or changing the pH of the mucous helps.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if using nasal irrigation, also known as nasal
      lavage, can reduce the severity of symptoms associated with COVID-19. Nasal lavage consists
      of running salt water in one nostril and out the other to get rid of germs. Saline nasal
      irrigation with Betadine or baking soda will be evaluated.

      Participants will be asked to do several things during this study: watch a one minute video
      on YouTube, use a nasal irrigation device twice a day for 14 days, complete a one-time
      detailed survey and keep a research diary about their usage and symptoms using an on-line
      application called Qualtrics, agree to be texted reminders, be called on the phone if they
      fail to complete the daily diary two days in a row, agree to be called four times, and
      provide contact information for a secondary person who can be contacted if the primary
      participant is unavailable.

      Participation in this study does not involve any significant risks. However, some people may
      find using nasal irrigation causes them some discomfort.

      While there are no known benefits to participating in the study participants may see a
      reduction in their symptoms more quickly than if they didn't participate in the study.

    <description>Intervention - twice-a-day nasal lavage Twice-a-day virucidal group: Participants randomized to betadine will receive 2 gallon jugs of distilled water, two NeilMed Sinus Irrigation bottles and 28 salination packets (with some extras), OR one Navage unit with 28 SaltPods (and some extras), and a cardboard receptacle labeled &quot;used saline containers&quot; to keep track of adherence.
Those randomized to receive betadine will also receive one bottle of povidone-iodine, a one-sheet instruction with photographs demonstrating how to add ½ tsp betadine in addition to the salination packet to the sinus irrigation bottle or Navage unit reservoir prior to SaltPod, along with a ½ tsp measuring spoon.</description>
