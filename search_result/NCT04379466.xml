  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specificity of the adaptive immune response (AIR), and its balance between effector T
      cells (Teffs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs), is most likely a major determinant of the
      outcome of a Covid-19 infection.

      We aim to analyze (i) the cellular components and (ii) the specificity of the AIR to COVID-19
      in 60 patients with moderate and severe form of the disease. This should have important
      implications for (i) understanding the pathophysiology of the disease, (ii) discovering
      biomarkers of severity and (iii) designing treatments and vaccines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The quality of the adaptive immune response (AIR) to COVID-19 probably determines the course
      of the disease. Therefore, a comprehensive knowledge of the immune response to COVID-19 is
      required to better anticipate its outcome and identify vaccine targets. In particular, the
      quality of an AIR can be investigated by immunophenotyping (enumerating immune cells and
      assessing their fitness) and by analyzing the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire.

      The cellular components of the AIR will be analyzed by a deep immunophenotyping generating
      &gt;800 measures assessing immune cells quantitatively and qualitatively (Pitoiset et al.,2018).
      Combined with supervised and unsupervised analyses, it has the power to detect subtle/hidden
      abnormalities.

      The specificity will be analyzed by studying the global T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of
      separated Tregs and Teffs from peripheral blood, as well as by single cell sequencing of
      cells from bronchoalveolar lavages.

      These combined approaches should uncover parameters/abnormalities of the AIR linked to the
      infection severity and outcome, and lead to a better understanding of the nature of the Tregs
      and Teffs repertoires against COVID-19. This will have important implications for (i)
      understanding the pathophysiology of the disease, (ii) discovering biomarkers of severity and
      (iii) designing treatments and vaccines.
