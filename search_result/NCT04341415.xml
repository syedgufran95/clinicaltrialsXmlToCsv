  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has already overwhelmed the sanitary capacity. Additional therapeutic
      arsenals, albeit untested in the given context but previously proven to be efficacious in a
      related clinical context, that could reduce the morbidity rate are urgently needed.

      A decrease of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a validated bad prognosis marker in sepsis and
      acute respiratory distress syndrome.

      In contrast, auricular vagus nerve stimulation was proven not only to increase HRV values in
      healthy Humans, but also to reduce sepsis and increase survival, both significantly, in
      experimental models.

      Moreover, the heavy viral infection within the brainstem of deceased patients suggests that
      the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV2 is likely to be partially responsible for COVID-19
      acute respiratory failure and may bear relevance in tailoring future treatment modalities.

      Interestingly, the vagus nerve (or tenth cranial nerve) connects bidirectionally the
      brainstem to various internal organs including the lung and to one external organ, namely,
      the outer ear.

      Hence, the impact of auricular vagus nerve stimulation through semi-permanent needles will be
      studied, mostly used so far for pain alleviation, on the outcome of COVID-19 inpatients
      within 15 days.

Ear disinfection and sterile neuromodulation needle placement (service protocol with Chlorhexidine) Placement of 4 semi-permanent Classic needles (SEDATELEC®) on each ear flap at the level of the concha (innervated by the vagus nerve) according to an order and a precise location (4 cardinal points conch), i.e. 8 needles per patient.
Compress soaked with Oxygenated water on the concha (to stop potential bleeding).
