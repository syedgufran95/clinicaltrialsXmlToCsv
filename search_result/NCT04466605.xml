  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Covid-19 outbreak and lockdown measures raised significant concerns over clinical management
      of chronic pain patients around the world. Patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMSP)
      are at high risk of physical disability, psychological distress, and poor quality of life.
      Analgesic medications were main management during lockdown, but opioid-related concerns have
      prompted to find immediate alternatives.

      Present study was undertaken to determine whether patients randomized to tele-yoga therapy
      would experience less pain, disability and improved global health, adherence and
      satisfaction, compared with patients assigned to usual care.
