  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The new coronavirus pandemic responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV2
      requires, in its severe forms, the use of invasive ventilation in intensive care.

      The first patients seen in intensive care presented with neurological symptoms and usually
      not seen in non-viral ARDS or due to other viral causes. These were mainly restless
      awakenings, attempts at self-extubation and confusional syndromes. Although the data in the
      literature do not seem to reveal the presence of SARS-CoV2 in the CSF of these patients,
      certain elements seem to show parenchymal brain damage with the description of hypometabolism
      of the frontal regions. In addition, most of these patients present a memory complaint after
      going into intensive care (personal data not published).

      We do not know to date what is the cognitive and psychic profile of these patients, nor what
      will be their future evolution. Some patients may require specific neuro-cognitive
      rehabilitation.

      The aim of this study is to assess the cognitive profile of patients infected with COVID-19
      who have used invasive ventilation in the intensive care unit of Paris Saint-Joseph hospital
      since April 2020, in order to be able to compare them between them and follow their evolution
      in the medium term. This work could make it possible to describe the specific cognitive
      impairment of SARS-CoV2, by trying to evade other causes of cognitive disorders in patients
      hospitalized in intensive care for respiratory distress (hypoxia, treatments, metabolic
      disorders, etc.).

      The main objective is to follow the medium-term evolution between 3 and 6 months of the
      cognitive profile of patients with severe form of SARS-CoV2 with the use of ventilatory
      resuscitation.

          -  Patient with SARS-CoV2 treated in the intensive care unit of the HPSJ for respiratory
