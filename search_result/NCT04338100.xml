  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 pandemic has developed worldwide in less than 4 months. While most patients have a
      mild or uncomplicated disease (80%), approximately 15% need hospital care and 5% intensive
      care. Severe cases are characterized by pulmonary involvement which may progress to acute
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Early identification of patients who are likely to get
      worse is therefore a major issue.

      While, chest X-ray has poor diagnostic performances, pulmonary computed tomography (CT scan)
      seems very sensitive (97%) and quite specific of COVID-19. Sub-pleural bilateral ground-glass
      pattern can precede the positivity of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. CT scan is now considered as the
      best imaging test to assess COVID-19 patients and is recommended as first-line diagnosis tool
      by the French Society of Radiology (SFR). However, performing CT scan in all or many patients
      with suspected COVID-19 may result in radiology department overload, especially, taking into
      account bio-cleaning between patients. Moreover, CT scan may lead to adverse effects
      including induced cancer due to the cumulative diagnostic irradiation.

      Chest ultrasonography may be an alternative to CT scan. It is a simple, non-invasive,
      non-irradiating, inexpensive and available at the point of care (POCUS). Most of emergency
      physicians and many other specialists (pneumologists, infectious disease or intensive care
      physicians) are trained to perform chest POCUS and use it in their everyday practice.
      Multiple studies have demonstrated its superiority to chest X-ray for the detection of
      pneumonia. In ARDS, a scoring has been developed and has shown good correlation with
      mortality. POCUS is very effective in detecting peripheral patterns and seems appropriate to
      explore COVID-19 patients.

      Previous studies suggest its interest in SARSCov2 infections for initial patient assessment
      and identification of lung damage. However, its performances have never been scientifically
      evaluated to date.

      Our main hypothesis is that point of care lung ultrasonography performed during the initial
      examination may identify high-risk COVID-19 patients.

      Patients consulting in the emergeny department of participating centres for suspected or
      confirmed COVID-19 are checked for inclusion and non-inclusion criteria and asked for study
      participation.

      Including patients have point-of-care lung ultrasonography (POCUS) performed within 48 hours
      following ED admission. The severity of lung damage is assessed using the lung
      ultrasonography score on 36 points for ARDS (POCUS score).

      Apart POCUS score assessment, patients are managed as usual.

      If a chest CT scan is performed, its result is collected and, in particular, the
      quantification of the extent of pulmonary lesions in percentage from 0 to 100%, carried out
      according to the recommendations of the French Society of Radiology.

      For hospitalized patients, if possible, a second chest ultrasonography is performed on Day 5
      +/- 3. The extent of lung damage is assessed by the POCUS score.

      A follow-up is carried out on day 14 (D14) and the patient's status according to the &quot;Ordinal
      Scale for Clinical Improvement&quot; for COVID-19 from WHO is recorded.

    <measure>Risk of unfavourable outcome at D14</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>To assess, in patients with confirmed or probable SARS-CoV-2 infection, chest ultrasonography capacity, using the POCUS score for ARDS, to identify patients with unfavourable outcome at D14.
Unfavourable outcome is defined by intubation with mechanical ventilation requirement or death (Stage ≥ 6 on &quot;Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement&quot; of the World Health Organization) within 14 days of inclusion.
We will determine the 95% confidence interval of the AUC of the ROC curve and consider POCUS capacity as clinically relevant if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval is at least 0.7.</description>

    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate, in patients with a confirmed or probable SARS-CoV-2 infection, whether POCUS score performances vary as a function of time, between D1 and D14, and, if so, until which time horizon its performances are clinically relevant.
In this purpose, we will determine the time period for which the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval of the AUC of the POCUS score ROC curve is at least 0.7.</description>

    <description>To identify the threshold values of POCUS score to perform risk-stratification in three groups of patients:
low-risk patients,
intermediate-risk patients,
high-risk patients.
In this purpose, we will determine two threshold values on the inflection points of the ROC curve:
maximizing the specificity for a sensitivity of at least 95%,
maximizing the sensitivity for a specificity of at least 95%.</description>
