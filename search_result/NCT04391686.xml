        Patients admitted to resuscitation under mechanical ventilation and who have benefited from
        a first indirect calorimetry measurement via COSMED Q NRG within 48 hours after their
        admission are identified by the physicians of the resuscitation department. If these
        patients meet all the inclusion criteria, they will be notified to the center's
        investigators so that the latter can take the necessary steps to inform the patient or the
        confidential person about the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For the Ambulatory Obese Control Group, the inclusion criteria are:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years;

          -  Patient followed in the nutrition service;

          -  Patient who benefited from an indirect calorimetry whatever the indication between
             01/01/20 and 31/12/2020);

          -  BMI&gt; 30.

        For the COVID Group and the Resuscitation Control Group, the inclusion criteria are:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years;

          -  Patient having undergone a resuscitation stay between 01/01/2020 and 31/12/2020

          -  Patient on mechanical ventilation (intubated or tracheotomized) during their stay in
             intensive care;

          -  Patient having benefited from an indirect calorimetry upon arrival in intensive care;

        Only for the COVID Group:

          -  Patient hospitalized in intensive care for COVID 19 infection diagnosed by a positive
             PCR via nasopharyngeal sampling or endotracheal aspiration.

          -  Patient who has not yet carried out his post-resuscitation visit;

        Only for the Resuscitation Control Group:

        - Patient hospitalized in intensive care for an indication other than an infectious cause.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Non-inclusion criteria for the Ambulatory Obese Control Group:

          -  Person deprived of liberty;

          -  Person subject to legal protection measures;

          -  Patient's opposition to participate in research.

        The non-inclusion criteria for the COVID Group and the Resuscitation Control Group:

          -  For patients intubated during the resuscitation stay Fi02&gt; 70% which does not allow a
             correct interpretation of the calorimetry;

          -  Pregnancy ;

          -  Person deprived of liberty;

          -  Person subject to legal protection measures;

          -  Opposition of the patient or the person of trust to participate in the research.

        Only for the COVID Group:

          -  Contraindication to indirect calorimetry (claustrophobia for post-resuscitation
             patients where calorimetry is performed with a mask);

          -  Contraindication to bioimpedancemetry (electronic implants, limb amputation, weight
             &lt;30kg or&gt; 300kg);
