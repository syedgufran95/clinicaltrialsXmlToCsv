    <textblock>
      ULSC-CV-01 is a clinical trial that comprises both Phase 1 and Phase 2a, which will be
      conducted sequentially. This trial will evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of
      allogeneic Umbilical Cord Lining Stem Cells (ULSC), which are a type of umbilical cord tissue
      derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), with intravenous (IV) administration in hospitalized
      patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Phase 1, open-label, non-controlled trial in this study will investigate the safety of
      intravenous (IV) infusion of ULSC in a total of 20 patients with COVID-19-related ARDS that
      will include patients that are not intubated and not on a ventilator (NV) and patients that
      are intubated and on a ventilator (V) for respiratory support. Separate cohorts of each group
      (NV and V) will receive either a single dose (one infusion) or repeat dose (two infusions
      separated by 48-hour interval).

      The Phase 2a randomized and placebo-controlled trial in this study will investigate the
      potential efficacy of IV infusion of ULSC in a total of 40 patients with COVID-19-related
      ARDS that will all be EITHER NV or V; the determination of that eligibility criterion and the
      ULSC dosing regimen will be based on Phase 1 data of safety and tolerability. Phase 2a will
      evaluate EITHER single dose (one infusion) or repeat dose (two infusions separated by 48-hour
      interval). The randomization will be 3:1 with 30 patients receiving investigational product
      (ULSC) and 10 patients receiving placebo (carrier control).

             (PaO2)/oxygen concentration (FiO2)]:

               -  Mild ARDS: 200 mm Hg &lt; PaO2/FIO2 â‰¤ 300 mm Hg

               -  Moderate ARDS: 100 mm Hg &lt; PaO2/FIO2 â‰¤ 200 mm Hg

               -  Severe ARDS: PaO2/FIO2 â‰¤ 100 mm Hg

          4. Patient who has exhibited deterioration in condition during the past 72 hours prior to

          5. Patient receiving standard of care in-hospital therapy, including appropriate critical
             oxygenation, fluid, and hemodynamic support as indicated clinically.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Hypersensitivity to study product components. History of hypersensitivity to dimethyl
             sulfoxide (DMSO).

          2. Active cancer or prior diagnosis of cancer within the past year; however, patients
             with basal and squamous cell cancer of skin will not be excluded.

          3. Organ transplant recipient.

          4. Chronic renal failure being treated by renal replacement therapy (dialysis) before
             development of COVID-19.

          5. Any other condition that, in the judgment of the Investigator or Sponsor, would be a
             contraindication to enrollment, study product administration, or follow-up.

          6. Pregnancy or lactation; a negative pregnancy test between screening and day 1 (before
             administration of treatment) will be required of women with childbearing potential,
             and they will be advised of the requirement to use an effective means of
             contraception. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential unless she is
             postmenopausal and without menses for 12 months or without a uterus and/or both
             ovaries.
