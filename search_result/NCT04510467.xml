      this observational, cross-sectional, national, comparative study, including RMD patients
      followed in hospital centres of the FAI²R Rare Diseases Healthcare Pathway network and
      specialist private practitioners caring for patients suffering from inflammatory rheumatism,
      systemic autoimmune diseases and auto-inflammatory diseases. The objective of the study is to
      compare RMD patients with COVID 19 infection (cases) to RMD patients who have not had COVID
      19 infection (controls) on their mental health.
