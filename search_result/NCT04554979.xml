      The present study conducted to correlate symptoms not only constitutional and respiratory,
      but GIT as a principle presentation, with laboratory markers and COVID-19 severe acute
      respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV2) disease outcomes, as the duration of symptoms varies
      substantially between patients; the investigators undertook this study to determine the
      optimal time to predict COVID-19 outcomes based on real-time experience.

      This observational retrospective cohort single center national study was conducted on
      patients who tested positive COVID-19 infection by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of
      nasopharyngeal sample in the period from first June to the med of July 2020. Patients were
      recruited from Kasr Al-Aini School of medicine, COVID-19 out-patient clinic, Cairo University
      hospitals.

      The diagnosis and classification of severity of COVID-19 infection were made according to the
      clinical management of COVID-19, released by the World Health Organization (WHO), mild and
      moderate case were recruited, the treatment protocol used was according to the Egyptian
      ministry of health treatment recommendations, which met in part the criteria that was later
      on published by the national institute of health, Mild and moderate cases once diagnosed by
      PCR received hydroxychloroquine 400 mg twice daily first day and maintained on 200 mg twice
      daily for 6 days in mild cases and 10 days in moderate cases. Also they received
      anticoagulants, vitamin c and zinc. In case of secondary bacterial infection, empiric
      antibiotics are started till result of sputum culture and sensitivity. Steroids were
      initiated in hypoxic cases that required supplemental oxygen and in cases of persistent
      symptoms.

      Any adult patient (age ≥18 years) suffering from mild or moderate COVID-19 infection was
      included in this study. While severe cases according to WHO classifications and patients aged
      less than18 were excluded from the study.

        Patients was recruited from COVID19 out-patient clinic, Cairo University hospitals.
        Severity Classification made according to the WHO (13) and Egyptian ministry of health
        treatment recommendations (14) Clinical data was collected including patient demographics
        (age, gender, weight and height, body mass index, comorbid conditions (e.g.diabetes
        mellitus, chronic pulmonary disease), vital signs. Clinical symptoms were recorded using
        yes/no checklist about constitutional symptoms, respiratory symptoms, loss of taste, loss
        of smell and gastrointestinal symptoms.The patients were followed up daily; by telehealth
        through phone calls and commercial video chat platforms, till symptoms offset. Laboratory
        assessment was collected within 24 hours of symptoms onset (complete blood picture, kidney
        and liver biochemistry, random blood sugar, serum C-reactive protein, D-dimer, ferritin,
        lipid profile, and lactate dehydrogenase). CT chest was performed and its result was
        recorded
