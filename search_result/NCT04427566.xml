  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low doses of radiation in the form of chest X-rays have been used to treat people with
      pneumonia. This treatment was found to be effective by reducing inflammation and with minimal
      side effects. However, it was an expensive treatment and was eventually replaced with less
      costly treatments such as antibiotics. Radiation has also been shown in some animal
      experiments to reduce some types of inflammation.

      Some patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia will experience worsening disease, which can
      become very serious, requiring the use of a ventilator. This is caused by inflammation in the
      lung from the virus and the immune system. For this study, the x-ray given is called
      radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-energy X-ray beams from a large machine to
      target the lungs and reduce inflammation. Usually, it is given at much higher doses to treat
      cancers.

      The purpose of this study is to find out if adding a single treatment of low-dose x-rays to
      the lungs might reduce the amount of inflammation in the lungs from a COVID-19 infection,
      which could help a patient to breathe without use of a ventilator.

      The primary outcome is the mortality rate 30 days after the ICU-based mechanical ventilation
      initiation.Based on current data available, the mortality rate for ventilated patients is
      assumed to be 80% in the current design. An interim futility analysis will be conducted after
      16 evaluable patients have received the ultralow dose-whole lung radiation therapy
      (ULD-WLRT). If at least 3 patients survive for at least 30 days, we will enroll additional 8
      patients (total of 24 patients). Otherwise, the trial will stop for further evaluation. Due
      to the limited data currently available in local institutions about a 30 day mortality rate ,
      we will retrospectively evaluate the mortality rate of the ventilated patients without the
      ULD-WLRT in our institution when data is available.

      Time to event secondary objectives (e.g. overall survival, time to discharge) analyses will
      be performed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, with a competing risk model (leaving the
      study because of death), including effects for demographic/clinical characteristics in the
      model. Proportional endpoints (such as % patients off ventilator) will be calculated along
      with the 95% Clopper-Pearson exact confidence interval. Pre/post measurements will be
      evaluated using linear mixed models for repeated measures (with proper data transformation as
      needed). Association between demographic/clinical characteristics and other secondary
      objectives (size of ground glass opacities (GGO)/opacification, for example) will be
      accomplished with generalized linear models.
