  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected the global
      population with significant morbidity and mortality. One of the main concerns is the
      management of the patients since there is no specific treatment for this condition.
      Therefore, in SARS-CoV-2 patients the compassionate use of off-label therapies has been
      initiated; such as the use of plasma from convalescent patients. This treatment has been used
      in other pandemics like SARS-CoV-1, H5N1, H1N1, Ebola, among others. This study is a phase
      II/III randomized clinical trial to assess the effectiveness and safety of convalescent
      plasma administration in patients with high-risk SARS-CoV-2.

      This is a Phase II/III randomized clinical trial to assess the effectiveness and safety of
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma in i) hospitalized adult patients with high-risk of
      progression SARS-CoV-2 infection and ii) patients in Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

      Compatible ABO plasma from convalescent patients will be administered at a dose of 400 ml
      divided into two doses intravenously. Outcomes will be measured as follows:

      * Group of patients with critical illness:

      Primary outcomes (Effectiveness and safety):

        -  Mortality

        -  Safety: Presence of adverse events

      Secondary outcomes:

        -  Intensive care unit length of stay

        -  Evolution of clinical and paraclinical aspects.

             -  Group of patients at high risk of progression:

      Primary outcomes (Effectiveness and safety):

        -  Mortality

        -  Safety: Presence of adverse events

        -  Admission to ICU in 30 days

        -  Mechanical ventilation requirement

      Secondary outcomes:

        -  Hospital/Intensive care unit length of stay

        -  Evolution of clinical and paraclinical aspects.
