        Day 1, unless noted otherwise, to be enrolled in this study:

          1. Male or female, 18 years of age or older at the time of consent (Screening Visit, Day
             0).

          2. Understands and agrees to comply with the study procedures and provides written
             informed consent.

          3. According to the assessment of the investigator, is in good general health and can
             comply with study procedures.

          4. Body mass index (BMI) of 18 kg/m2 to 30 kg/m2 (inclusive) at the Screening Visit (Day
             0).

          5. Female participants of nonchildbearing potential may be enrolled in the study.
             Nonchildbearing potential is defined as surgically sterile (history of bilateral tubal
             ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy) or postmenopausal (defined as
             amenorrhea for â‰¥ 12 consecutive months prior to Screening (Day 0) without an
             alternative medical cause). A follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level may be measured
             at the discretion of the investigator to confirm postmenopausal status.

          6. Female participants of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study if the
             participant fulfills all the following criteria:

               -  Has a negative pregnancy test at Screening (Day 0) and on the day of the first
                  injection (Day 1).

               -  Has practiced adequate contraception or has abstained from all activities that
                  could result in pregnancy for at least 28 days prior to the first injection (Day
                  1).

               -  Has agreed to continue adequate contraception through 3 months following the
                  second injection (Day 29).

               -  Is not currently breastfeeding.

             Adequate female contraception is defined as consistent and correct use of a Food and
             Drug Administration (FDA) approved contraceptive method in accordance with the product
             label. For example:

               -  Barrier method (such as condoms, diaphragm, or cervical cap) used in conjunction
                  with spermicide

               -  Prescription hormonal contraceptive taken or administered via oral (pill),
                  transdermal (patch), subdermal, or IM route

               -  Sterilization of a female participant's monogamous male partner prior to entry
                  into the study Note: periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception.

          7. Male participants engaging in activity that could result in pregnancy of sexual
             partners must agree to practice adequate contraception from the time of the first
             injection and through 3 months after the last injection.

        Adequate contraception for male participants is defined as:

          -  Monogamous relationship with a female partner using an intrauterine device or hormonal
             contraception (described above)

          -  Use of barrier methods and spermicide

          -  History of surgical sterilization

          -  Male participants with partners who have become pregnant prior to Screening are
             eligible to participate in the study.
