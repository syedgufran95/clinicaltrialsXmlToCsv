  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      : Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SAB Biotherapeutics has developed SAB-185,
      an Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Human Immunoglobulin Intravenous (transchromosomic [Tc] bovine-derived),
      as a potential therapeutic to treat COVID-19. This study will evaluate the safety,
      immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetics of SAB-185 in ambulatory participants with COVID-19.

    <description>SAB-185 is a purified human immunoglobulin G (hIgG) designed to specifically bind to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viruses. SAB-185 is purified from the plasma of immunized Tc bovines that were immunized initially (vaccinations 1 and 2) with a plasmid DNA (pDNA) vaccine that expresses wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, followed by additional immunizations (vaccinations 3 and beyond) with a recombinant spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 produced in insect cells. The purified hIgG is a sterile liquid formulated in 10 mM glutamic acid monosodium salt, 262 mM D-sorbitol, 0.05 mg/mL Tween 80, pH 5.5. The drug product will be administered intravenously and will be diluted in saline per the clinical protocol.</description>
