  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to perform an observational study to evaluate the prevalence of
      burnout, depression and medical errors in a designated exclusive Covid-19 patients hospital
      in Malaysia, during the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, the relationship between burnout and
      depression with medical errors will be assessed. The population studied will be the nurses
      working in the Intensive Care Unit, who are at higher risk due to the nature of their work at
      the frontlines of the pandemic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During this unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic crisis in the whole world, Malaysia is also
      affected, with more than 5000 patients infected in the whole country as of 20th April, 2020.
      Many Intensive Care Unit nurses, who are at the frontlines of managing Covid-19 patients,
      face increased workload, in addition to psychological stress from managing these patients,
      with stress also coming from being exposed to the risk of cross infection. Hence, they are
      possibly at high risk of burnout and depression. In such a time of increased stress, the
      investigators also seek to find out the prevalence of medical errors made by Intensive Care
      Unit nurses during this pandemic, and whether the medical errors are associated with burnout.
      Factors associated with burnout, depression and medical errors will also be evaluated.
