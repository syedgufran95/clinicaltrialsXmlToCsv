      The &quot;COVID-19 infection self-test and alert system&quot; (hereinafter referred to as &quot;COVID-19
      self-test applet&quot;) jointly developed by Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital, Institute for
      precision medicine, artificial intelligence of Tsinghua University was launched on February
      1，2020. Residents , according to their actual healthy situation, after answering questions
      online, the system will conduct intelligent analysis, make disease risk assessment and give
      healthcare and medical guidance. Based on the Internet population survey, and referring to
      the diagnosis and screening standards of the National Health Commission of the People's
      Republic of China, investigators carried out the mobile applet of Internet survey and
      registry study for the Internet accessible identifiable population, so as to screen the
      suspected population and guide the medical treatment.

        Most people including healthy or susceptible patients or diagnosed patients will be
        enrolled. People whoever worry about his heath status relating with infection of COVID-19
        at present can register and answer the question and get a score for risk evaluation. If a
        high risk achieved, the applet will guide the interviewer for further medical diagnosis and
        treatment.
