  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study Investigators propose to administer clazakizumab to patients with
      life-threatening COVID-19 infection manifest by pulmonary failure and a clinical picture
      consistent with a cytokine storm syndrome. This is a single-center randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial in which 30 patients will be enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1
      ratio to two study arms that will receive clazakizumab at a dose of 25 mg or placebo.

      In this study Investigators propose to administer clazakizumab to patients with severe
      COVID-19 infection manifest by pulmonary failure and a clinical picture consistent with a
      cytokine storm syndrome. This is a single-center randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trial in which 30 patients will be enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to three
      study arms that will receive clazakizumab at a dose of 25 mg or placebo.

      The primary endpoint is patient safety assessed by serious adverse events associated with
      clazakizumab or placebo.

      The secondary endpoints are: incidence of intubation, time to extubation, length of ICU stay,
      severity of AKI, need for RRT, duration of RRT, trend in C-reactive protein, and patient
      survival at 28 and 60 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. At least 18 years of age

          -  2. Confirmed COVID-19 disease (by Cobas Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2
             real time RT-PCR using nasopharyngeal swab sample, or equivalent test available to be
             performed by the Johns Hopkins Medical Laboratories Services). Effort will be made to
             have the confirmatory test result &lt;72 hours prior to enrollment however given overall
             clinical demand this may not be feasible in all cases.

          -  3. Respiratory failure manifesting as: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (defined by
             a P/F ratio of &lt;200), OR SpO2 &lt; 90% on 4L (actual or expected given higher O2
             requirement) OR increasing O2 requirements over 24 hours, PLUS 2 or more of the
             following predictors for severe disease:

               -  CRP &gt; 35 mg/L

               -  Ferritin &gt; 500 ng/mL

               -  D-dimer &gt; 1 mcg/L

               -  Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio &gt; 4

               -  LDH &gt; 200 U/L

               -  Increase in troponin in patient w/out known cardiac disease

          -  4. Has a consent designee willing to provide informed consent on behalf of the patient
             (this assumes that a mechanically ventilated patients lacks capacity to consent on
             his/her own behalf. Should it be deemed that the patient has capacity to consent,
             consent may be obtained from the patient.)

          -  5. Women of childbearing potential must be willing and able to use at least one highly
             effective contraceptive method for a period of 5 months following the study drug
             administration. In the context of this study, an effective method is defined as those
             which result in low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently
             and correctly such as:

               1. combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception combined
                  (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal,
                  or transdermal)

               2. progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation
                  (oral, injectable, implantable)

               3. intrauterine device (IUD)

               4. intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)

               5. vasectomized partner

               6. bilateral tubal occlusion

               7. true abstinence. when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence, such as calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  postovulation methods, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception.

          -  6. Men must be willing to use a double-barrier contraception from enrollment until at
             5 months after the last dose of study drug, if not abstinent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Evidence of irreversible injury deemed non-survivable even if the pulmonary failure
             recovers (for example severe anoxic brain injury)

          -  2. Known active inflammatory bowel disease

          -  3. Known active, untreated diverticulitis

          -  4. Known untreated bacteremia

          -  5. Pregnancy. (The protocol will exclude pregnant subjects given the lack of overall
             data on use of clazakizumab in pregnancy however the study team would consider a
             protocol revision should more than 3 potential pregnant study subjects be excluded on
             this basis).

          -  6. Known hypersensitivity to the clazakizumab

          -  7. Use of other IL-6 inhibitor investigational drugs at the time of enrollment
