  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the pandemic era, medical personnel should wear full protective suits. However, they
      limit the performance of medical procedures. One of the main questions is whether to use
      double gloves. The study was based on dying gloves used during resuscitation. The gloves were
      secured with disposable hermetically sealed pouches and described by one of the EMS team
      members - each time after resuscitation was completed.
