  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although COVID-19 disease due to Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
      affects the respiratory tract, heart and coagulation system, symptoms of gastrointestinal
      system involvement such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are also common.

      In this study, it was aimed retrospective analysis of clinical and laboratory data of
      patients who developed pancreatic injury in the course of COVID 19 disease.

        Patients who develop amylase and lipase elevation during the course of COVID 19 will be
        considered in the pancreatic injury group. Those who do not develop will be counted as the
        control group.
