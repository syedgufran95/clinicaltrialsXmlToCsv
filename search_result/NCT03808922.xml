    <textblock>
      This study will seek to enroll immunocompromised patients with Lower Tract parainfluenza
      infection.

      It also contains a sub-study to enroll patients with severe COVID-19.

      Eligible subjects (i.e., those meeting the Inclusion / Exclusion criteria) will be enrolled
      in one of four cohorts based on the following criteria:

      Cohort 1:

      All eligible subjects in the PoI who are ≥18 year old subjects with a PIV infection and meet
      all of the following criteria:

      1.1 Meet criteria for being severely immunocompromised 1.2 Prior to the onset of PIV
      infection, had no ongoing need for oxygen therapy due to a chronic respiratory condition
      (e.g., COPD, sleep apnea) and are assessed as acutely hypoxemic due to their PIV infection
      1.3 At the time of randomization are not on mechanical, bi-level or continuous positive
      airway pressure (Bi-PAP or CPAP) ventilation 1.4 Have no known concurrent respiratory viral
      coinfection(s)

      Cohort 2:

      All eligible subjects in the PoI who are ≥18 year old with a PIV infection (including those
      with PIV and another SAD-RV) who do not meet one or more of the listed criteria for Cohort 1.

      Cohort 3:

      All eligible subjects in the PoI who are &lt;18 year old subjects with a PIV infection
      (including those with PIV and another concurrent SAD-RV). There is no lower age limit for
      this cohort.

      Cohort 4:

      All eligible subjects in the PoI with a respiratory infection due to any SAD-RV infection
      except PIV. Eligible subjects with both PIV and an additional concurrent SAD-RV, will be
      enrolled for either Cohorts 2 or 3 depending on their age. There is no lower age limit for
      this cohort.

      Sub-Study:

      Patients with Severe COVID-19
