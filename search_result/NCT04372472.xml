      This is a single-site prospective study to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the
      investigational SeptiScan System for patients presenting to the Emergency Department with
      signs or suspicion of COVID-19 or other infectious respiratory diseases.

    <measure>To demonstrate the performance of the SeptiScan System as a diagnostic marker of life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host immune response to infection.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day of enrollment through Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>The SeptiScan System is an investigational microfluidic assay that measures the biophysical properties of human leukocytes as an aid, in conjunction with other clinical assessments, to detect life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host immune response to infection. The SeptiScan System score is presented in three Interpretation Bands of low, intermediate, and high probability of disease. Remnant blood samples will be obtained from subjects in Emergency Department with signs or suspicion of COVID-19 or other infectious respiratory diseases. The blood samples will be analyzed using the SeptiScan System.</description>
