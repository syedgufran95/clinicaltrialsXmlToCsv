  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Northern Italy has been profoundly touched by the Covid-19 pandemic. To limit the outbreaks
      of contagion, the Italian government imposed 2.months of complete lock-down, which imposed
      the social isolation for the whole population and, for those positive to the Covid-19, the
      complete confinement at home. Despite the recommendations for conserving healthy lifestyle of
      the Italian Government, during the lock-down the likelihood to fall into unhealthy behaviours
      might have increased.

      This study aims to describe the impact of Covid-19 on the lifestyles of a population of
      Italian adults living in an area of high spread of Sars-CoV-2.

      lock-down phase and the support services used the most by participants.

      and social networks.

      The on-line survey is free to access, self-administered and it consists of 50 questions. The
      questions investigates the changes occurred in employment status, physical exercise, diet,
      tobacco and alcohol consumption, sleep quality and leisure activities during the pandemic
      lock-down phase as well as the available local support services used and perceived as useful.
