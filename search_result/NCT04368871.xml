    <textblock>
      In this prospective trial the investigator will work on radiology findings and their temporal
      changes in COVID-19 positive patients and who underwent chest radiograph will be enrolled in
      our study.

      Patient selection will be consecutive in addition of age , gender and comorbid conditions
      clinical information will included travel,expose and contact history. All patients should be
      positive for COVID-19 via laboratory testing with real time reverse transcriptase polymerase
      chain reaction(rRT-PCR) In addition, the number of rRT-PCR tests performed on each patient,
      on which test a positive result was found,and the number of days between symptomology onset
      and date of first positive test will be recorded.

      In view of the current dynamics, any other reliable diagnostic test(s) if added to the
      clinical protocol will also be considered for inclusion in this study.

      Tabulation of radiographic findings for all consecutive X-rays will be done along with the
      temporal changes of these findings. further, the clinical findings with the outcomes(duration
      of hospital findings, ventilatory support and discharge/death).
