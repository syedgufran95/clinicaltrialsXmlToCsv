  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the effect of the Shingrix vaccine on your immune
      system and whether that has any effect on the body's ability to fight off other infections
      such as COVID-19. We hypothesize that:

      H1: Shingrix vaccination will elevate acute and trained immunity

      H2: For 6 months following the first injection, increased levels of acute and trained
      immunity is associated with less disease, including fewer hospitalizations and deaths
      associated with flu, pneumonia, and COVID-19.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to provide preliminary data in support of the concept that
      training of the innate immune system occurs following immunization (2 doses, 2 months apart)
      with the Shingrix vaccine as compared to placebo (normal saline) in older adults residing in
      nursing homes. Two hundred nursing home residents, both men and women, aged &gt;65 years, who
      have not acquired COVID-19 (verified through a screening questionnaire and by both viral
      antigen and antibody testing at the screen and least one week before the first injection)
      will get two intramuscular injections containing either the Shingrix vaccine, and the other
      half, two injections containing a normal saline (placebo comparison) approximately two months
      apart. Blood samples are collected before the baseline injection (day zero), 1 day after the
      second injection (61 days post) and 1 month following the second injection (90 days). Weekly
      symptom checks and monthly antibody testing around day 180- will identify residents with
      COVID-19 and the severity of COVID-19 symptoms.

      The primary outcome is the difference in immune cell capacity to produce type I interferon,
      interferon associated molecules, and proinflammatory mediators after receiving a 2 injection
      series of the Shingrix vaccine versus normal saline. Secondary outcomes include differences
      in hospitalization, pulmonary infections, and positive COVID-19 cases (via antibody testing
      on days 60, 90, and 180) in the Shingrix and normal saline groups. We anticipate that
      residents receiving the Shingrix vaccine will demonstrate signs of &quot;trained&quot; immunity
      compared to a control group receiving saline injections.

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>Blinding is done to ensure staff and residents do not modify reports or reporting of COVID symptoms and to minimize other behaviors (such as sleeping, eating habits, physical activity) that may affect their innate immune system. It will also serve to minimize any bias in the processing/analysis of samples and the interpretation of the study results.
During the conduct of the study, only three people (the statistician and 2 research nurses who will reconstitute, draw up, and administer the injections) will have knowledge of the group assignments. Participants, the staff at the nursing home, the staff collecting the COVID symptom data, and study investigators are blinded to the subject assignments.</masking_description>

    <description>The Shingrix vaccine is a subunit vaccine that contains the recombinant varicella zoster virus (VZV) glycoprotein E (gE), adjuvanted with the proprietary Adjuvant System (AS01B). The AS01B Adjuvant system consists of two immune-stimulants, the saponin, Quillaja saponaria Molina, fraction 21 (QS21), and the TLR4 agonist, MPL (3-O-desacyl-40-MPL) that enhance the release of interferon gamma (IFNÏ’), which in turn stimulates activation and recruitment of blood monocyte-derived and resident lymph node dendritic cells to take up and present gE to cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4+) T cells.</description>
