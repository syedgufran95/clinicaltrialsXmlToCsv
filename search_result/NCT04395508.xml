  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm, multicenter study provides the fixed-dose combination of pertuzumab and
      trastuzumab for subcutaneous injection (PH FDC SC) administered at home by a home health
      nursing provider for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+)
      breast cancer who are currently receiving pertuzumab (Perjeta) and trastuzumab (Herceptin) by
      intravenous administration (P+H IV). The main objective is to enable continuity of care
      during the COVID-19 pandemic.

      This study will enroll approximately 400 participants with HER2+ breast cancer who have
      completed concurrent chemotherapy with P+H IV and are currently receiving or will be
      receiving maintenance therapy with pertuzumab and trastuzumab.

      Participants will receive treatment every 3 weeks and continue treatment unless early
      cessation is necessary due to disease recurrence, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity
      or participant withdrawal. Only participants with HER2+ early breast cancer will receive PH
      FDC SC to complete 18 cycles of dual blockade, including the P+H IV they received prior to
      enrolling in this study.

      The Sponsor may decide to terminate the study when the COVID-19 pandemic is no longer a risk
      for this patient population.

    <intervention_name>Fixed-Dose Combination of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab for Subcutaneous Administration (PH FDC SC)</intervention_name>
    <description>PH FDC SC is given as a fixed dose (i.e. non-weight based) subcutaneous injection. Two dosage configurations of PH FDC SC may be administered in the study: a 15-millilitre (mL) loading dose consisting of 1200 milligrams (mg) pertuzumab and 600 mg trastuzumab and a 10-mL maintenance dose consisting of 600 mg pertuzumab and 600 mg trastuzumab. Participants who have had ≥6 weeks since their last P+H IV or PH FDC SC treatment must receive a loading dose before continuing with maintenance doses for subsequent administrations.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female or male patients with histologically confirmed human epidermal growth factor
             receptor 2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer who have completed chemotherapy in
             combination with Perjeta and Herceptin and are currently receiving maintenance P+H IV
             (regardless of remaining treatment cycles [e.g., only 1 cycle remaining])

          -  HER2+ status must have been previously determined and is defined as 3+ by
             immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or positive by HER2 amplification by in situ
             hybridization (ISH) with a ratio of ≥ 2 for the number of HER2 gene copies to the
             number of chromosome 17 copies

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2

          -  Intact skin at planned site of subcutaneous (SC) injections (thigh)

          -  Baseline and most recent (within 3 months) LVEF ≥ 50% measured by echocardiogram
             (ECHO) or multiple-gated acquisition scan (MUGA)

          -  For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from
             heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from

        Exclusion Criteria:
