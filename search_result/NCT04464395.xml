    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 single-dose, dose-escalation study is an open label trial evaluating the safety
      of CPI-006, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the CD73 cell-surface ectonucleotidase,
      as immunotherapy for stable hospitalized mild or moderately symptomatic COVID-19 patients.
