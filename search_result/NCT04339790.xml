      Background:

      The COVID-19 outbreak has caused many changes to people s normal social patterns. The
      respiratory illness has been the major focus of public health efforts. But most experts also
      agree that government and public health mandates to slow the spread of the illness, such as
      social distancing, have a significant effect on people s mental health. Environmental
      stressors, such as constraints on activities, social contact, and access to resources, take a
      toll. Researchers want to learn how stressors related to COVID-19 affect mental health over
      time.

      Objective: To learn the relationship between stressors related to COVID-19 and self-rated
      measures of mental health symptoms and distress among a range of people.

      Eligibility:

      English-speaking adults ages 18 and older

      Design:

      This study will be conducted online.

      Participants will give their first and last name and email address. They will indicate if
      they have ever been in an NIH research study. They will get a username and password.

      Every 2 weeks for up to 6 months, participants will complete online study surveys. They will
      get email reminders. Some surveys will be repeated. At the end of the study, they will
      complete a set of end-of-study surveys.

      The surveys will ask about the following:

      Age, sex, race, and other sociodemographic data

      Mental and medical illness history and treatment

      Family medical history

      Mobility, self-care, and life activities

      Behaviors related to alcohol and substance use disorder

      Mental illness symptoms

      Psychological distress

      Stressors caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

      Participants will get links to mental health resources, such as hotlines. They will also get
      guidance on steps to take to seek care or support.

      Study Description: This protocol leverages existing NIMH studies and participants to
      accomplish time-sensitive research on the mental health impact of environmental stressors
      imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The study will describe the relationship between stressors
      related to COVID-19 and self-rated measures of mental health symptoms and distress among a
      range of participants including various patient populations and healthy volunteers. The
      utilization of a study website to consent and survey participants online is an efficient and
      timely way to collect research data during this unique public health crisis.

      Objectives: The primary objective is to describe the relationship between stressors related
      to COVID-19 and self-rated measures of mental health symptoms and distress among a range of
      participants including various patient populations and healthy volunteers. The secondary
      objectives are to determine whether existing mental health concerns moderates this
      relationship and to identify risk and resilience factors among study participants regarding
      the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

      Endpoints: The primary endpoints are descriptive data on stressors experienced as a result of
      the COVID-19 pandemic, and emotional, behavioral, and clinical symptoms. These endpoints will
      be measured repeatedly using an online platform for up to 6 months. These repeated measures
      will be combined with previously collected phenotype data on NIMH participants as allowed.

      Study Population: The sample size will be up to 10,000 and will include participants 18 years
      and older of both sexes, any gender, and health status. They must be English-speaking. The
      study population will include patient and volunteer participants who have consented for a
      NIMH study in the past as well as new participants from the general population who respond to
      advertisements for the NIMH COVID study but who have not previously been a NIMH study
      participant. The NIMH COVID study participants may or may not be local to the Metropolitan
      Washington DC area but since the study will be conducted entirely online, this is not
      relevant.
