  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The response to COVID-19 means social isolation/distancing for the majority of the UK. This
      has the potential to negatively affect all domains of quality of life (QoL). QoL can be
      improved by giving feedback on gaps between someone's perceived QoL in a domain and how
      important it is to them (plus prompting reflective questions). However, interventions that
      are designed to improve QoL may increase the effectiveness of this as optimised behaviour
      change techniques can be used. This study aims to develop and test a quality of life
      intervention during social isolation/distancing.

    <description>All participants will complete an online questionnaire. This will include demographic information, social distancing/isolation history, The Lubben Social Network Scale, The 6-item Loneliness Scale, Ten-Item Personality Scale, Spontaneous Self-affirmation Scale, Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire and the WHOQoL COMBI plus importance of QOL facet questions.
Participants randomly allocated to the feedback intervention will then be provided with graphs showing WHOQOL COMBI facet scores and their perceived importance ratings. The graphs will highlight where quality of life might be poor but important to the participant. Participants will be asked three questions (i.e. how could your QoL in this domain be improved, what resources would you need to make this change, what practical actions are needed to address the discrepancies in your QoL?) to help them plan how they might be able to improve quality of life currently rated as poor but important.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Extended Intervention</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>All participants will complete an online questionnaire (as described above).
Participants randomly allocated to the extended intervention will then be provided with graphs to highlight differences between their actual WHOQoL COMBI scores and their perceived importance ratings. The graphs will highlight where quality of life might be poor but important to the participant. Participants will be asked three questions (i.e. how could your QoL in this domain be improved, what resources would you need to make this change, what practical actions are needed to address the discrepancies in your QoL?) to help them plan how they might be able to improve quality of life currently rated as poor but important.
Participants will then receive an online intervention that will provide them with behaviour change techniques to help them address the discrepancies in the relevant quality of life domains.</description>

This will include demographic information, social distancing/isolation history, The Lubben Social Network Scale, The 6-item Loneliness Scale, Ten-Item Personality Scale, Spontaneous Self-affirmation Scale, Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire and the WHOQoL COMBI plus importance of QOL facet questions.
Participants randomly allocated to the waitlist control group will then receive their WHOQoL COMBI scores only, with no information about differences between quality of life and importance or intervention materials.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Behaviour Change Technique Intervention to Improve Quality of Life</intervention_name>
    <description>The intervention targets each facet of the five domains of WHOQOL COMBI. The intervention is based on the COM-B Framework (Michie et al., 2012) and utilises behaviour change techniques to help participants change their behaviour to improve their quality of life.
The intervention will be compared to an active comparator 'feedback intervention' and a waitlist control group.</description>
