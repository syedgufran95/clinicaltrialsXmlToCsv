  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is little information about the clinical characteristics and risk factors of Covid-19
      in Latin American countries considering the ethnic differences and the high prevalence of
      obesity and cardiometabolic diseases. The aim of the study was to evaluate the association
      between laboratory tests and the risk of complications in SARS-CoV-2 infection and to
      determine their mortality risk factors in a sample of the Mexican population.

      A retrospective cross-sectional study of the routinely collected data was performed in the
      Hospital Regional de Alta Especialidad de Ixtapaluca (HRAEI), State of Mexico. Adult patients
      (aged ≥18 years) with positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and oxygen support that were admitted
      between March 28 and May 5, 2020, were included

  <detailed_description>

      Data collection Data was collected deidentified admission from adult patients, with oxygen
      therapy. Data were extracted from clinical medical records and the electronic database of
      daily laboratory test results. Also, incomplete clinical records were included. The number of
      cases in the area during the study period determined the sample size, no formal hypotheses
      being implemented. All patients who met the inclusion criteria were included.

      Study variables Demographic variables (sex and age), chronic medical histories (hypertension,
      diabetes and cancer), laboratory plasma, and serum-based biomarkers, as well as the
      mortality, mechanical ventilation, and length of stay, were considered. Leukocytosis was
      considered as a leucocyte count above 10 x 103/mcL, a cut point of INL&gt; 10, d- dimer 500 U/L,
      DHL&gt; 500U/L, low count of lymphocytes &lt; 0·5103/mcL as risk factors exposure to death and
      mechanical ventilation.

      A new variable was create combining the data of neutrophil count (ANC) and lymphocyte count
      (ALC) to obtain the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (calculated dividing the ANC by the
      ALC).

      Outcomes The hypothesis was formulated before the statistical analysis. Our primary outcomes
      were to 1) To describe the clinical characteristics of the Mexican population with SARS-CoV-2
      infection, and 2) To determine the mortality risk factors in Covid-19.

      Secondary outcomes included 1) To identify the chronic diseases related to Covid-19 in
      Mexican population and 2) To evaluate the differences in hematic and biochemical parameters
      between survivors and no survivors.
