  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted routine hospital services globally. The hospital services
      include surgeries for benign diseases, cancer surgery and obstetric surgery. A study
      conducted by CovidSurg Collaborative estimated that 28,404,603 operations would be cancelled
      or postponed during the peak 12 weeks of disruption due to COVID-19. Globally, 81.7% of
      benign surgery, 37.7% of cancer surgery and 25.4% of elective Caesarean sections would be
      cancelled or postponed. If countries increase their normal surgical volume by 20%
      post-pandemic, it would take a median 45 weeks to clear the backlog of operations resulting
      from COVID-19 disruption. This study aims to estimate total number of elective operations
      postponed during COVID-19 in geriatric population.

      The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted routine hospital services globally. The hospital services
      include surgeries for benign diseases, cancer surgery and obstetric surgery. A study
      conducted by CovidSurg Collaborative estimated that 28,404,603 operations would be cancelled
      or postponed during the peak 12 weeks of disruption due to COVID-19. Globally, 81.7% of
      benign surgery, 37.7% of cancer surgery and 25.4% of elective Caesarean sections would be
      cancelled or postponed. If countries increase their normal surgical volume by 20%
      post-pandemic, it would take a median 45 weeks to clear the backlog of operations resulting
      from COVID-19 disruption. This study aims to estimate total number of elective operations
      postponed during COVID-19 in geriatric population.

      The primary objective of this study is to find incidence of elective surgeries has postponed
      during COVID-19 pandemic in geriatric population. This overarching aim raises two secondary
      objectives of the research:

        1. To find the incidents of cancer surgeries postponed during COVID-19 pandemic in
           geriatric population.

        2. To find the physical and psychological impact of postponed elective surgery in geriatric
           population during COVID-19 pandemic.

      An audit study will be conducted among geriatric patients that admitted for elective
      surgeries in University Malaya Medical center (UMMC). Patients who fulfilled the following
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited.

      Inclusion criteria:

        1. Geriatric patients (aged 65 and above)

        2. All elective surgeries under general anesthesia, regional anesthesia and ALA

      Exclusion criteria:

        1. Refuse to participate in the study

        2. Patients with cognitive disorders such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease

      Random convenience sampling will be conducted. Data will be collected using REDCap (Research
      Electronic Data Capture) system and analyzed using SPSS software. Results will be presented
      as mean Â± standard deviation, median or frequency (percentages) as appropriate. Mann-Whitney
      U test will be used for non-normally distributed data while t test will be used for normally
      distributed data. The qualitative data analysis will be performed using chi-square test or
      Fisher's exact test if insufficient numbers are present. A p value &lt; 0.05 will be considered
      statistically significant.
