  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Covid-19 is an additional stressor Black women have to deal with that may interfere with
      hypertension self-care management. Social connectedness is a source of resilience for Black
      women to promote mental and physical health. Unfortunately, in the face of the Covid-19
      pandemic, social distancing is a challenge further isolating Black women from their networks.
      How is social connectedness to manage stress and emotional well-being in a social-distancing
      society for Black women with hypertension? The research team proposed a synchronous web-based
      version of Enhanced Co-Created Health Education InterventioN (eCo-CHIN) that build the
      success and best practices derived from the original intervention. A Covid-19 session will be
      included as a way of helping Black women to maintain resilience and self-care during
      stressful times. The eCo-CHIN intervention is innovative and timely because the research team
      are using a synchronous platform preparing Black women on how to deal with Covid-19 while
      taking care of self. The primary investigator for this pilot study (Dr. Wright) is a Black
      Early Stage Investigator and former KL2 (career development) awardee. The interdisciplinary
      research team has the expertise and resources to deliver this Enhanced Co-CHIN intervention.

  <detailed_description>

      The rationale for the study is that the adherence to healthy self-care behaviors reduces poor
      nutrition, altered sleep, sedentary behavior, psychosocial stress, and emotional
      dysregulation, thereby reducing negative impacts on the brain, since all these factors
      contribute to neural inflammation and increased BP. Health-promoting self-care behaviors have
      the known short-term effect of enhanced cognitive function (processing speed, attention, and
      executive function) through the use of The Repeatable Neuropsychiatric Battery (RBANS) which
      is also an innovative component of OUR Project. Thirty middle-aged Black women (45-65 years
      old) with a self-reported diagnosis of hypertension will be enrolled. The development of this
      group-delivered intervention will be an iterative process, and the research team will use
      this pilot data to submit an R21 for a 12-week intervention through the National Institutes
      on Aging.
