  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the context of a viral outbreak and of widespread quarantine measures, a significant
      increase in psychological disorders, such as stress or fear behaviours, had previously been
      observed. This distress has been described on adults, but no data have been collected yet for
      paediatric populations.

      After a traumatic event, children and adolescents may present several clinical consequences,
      the most common being Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Moreover, PTSD in children and
      adolescents is often associated with comorbid disorders, such Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
      Disorder, depression, attachment and anxiety disorders, sleep disturbances and behavior
      problems.

      The aim of this study is to present the methodology of &quot;CoCo 20&quot; : is to assess the impact of
      the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and of seclusion measures on mental
      health and on the development of psychological disorders in children in the short to medium
      term

      on the development of psychological disorders in children in the short to medium term.

      The major inclusion criteria are children and adolescents under 18 years of age who have been
      affected by the Covid 19 pandemic. Three groups were defined: children in group one had a
      previous history of traumatic events, those in group two had a record of previous psychiatric
      or psychological disorder with a follow-up treatment and Group three included children
      without traumatic history nor psychiatric or psychological follow-up treatment. Participants
      will be assessed at baseline (V0), 1 week after (V1), one month after baseline (V2), one week
      after the end of the containment (V3) and one month after the end of the containment (V4).

      Main analyses comprise analyses of variance and regression analyses of predictors of clinical
      evolution over time
