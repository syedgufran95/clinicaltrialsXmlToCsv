      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous administration of bone marrow derived
      extracellular vesicles, ExoFlo, versus placebo as treatment for moderate-to-severe Acute
      Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in patients with severe COVID-19.

    <textblock>
      EXIT COVID-19 is a multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial that
      will enroll 60 COVID-19 patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS at three research sites across
      the U.S. The primary efficacy endpoints will be all-cause mortality and median days to
      recovery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provision of signed and dated informed consent form (either by the individual or by
             the individual's healthcare proxy).

          2. Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the
             duration of the study

          3. Male or female, aged 18-85.

          4. COVID-19 positive as defined by positive RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2.

          5. Moderate to severe ARDS as defined by modified Berlin definition*, which includes
             timing within 1 week of known clinical insult or new or worsening respiratory
             symptoms; bilateral opacities not fully explained by effusions, or lung collapse;
             respiratory failure not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload;
             PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 200 mm Hg.

          6. Clinical deterioration as evidenced by down-trending PaO2/FiO2 despite standard of
             care**.

          7. Acute presentation of hypoxia requiring noninvasive oxygen support such as NC, NRB,
             BIPAP, HFNC. OR Acute presentation of hypoxic respiratory failure which required
             intubation and subsequent mechanical ventilation.

          8. If the candidate is either male or females of reproductive potential, he or she must
             agree to use of double barrier method of highly effective birth control contraception
             such as condoms with oral contraceptive pill or choose to remain abstinent if already
             practicing abstinence during the screening period. The duration of required usage of
             double barrier method OR maintenance of abstinence must include the time from the
             beginning of the screening period until 90 days following the last dose of the study
             treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Concomitant use of other COVID-19 disease modifying treatments such as Remdesivir,
             Dexamethasone, Tocilizumab, Ritonavir/Lopinavir, and Hydroxychloroquine. (24 hour
             washout prior to first dose)

          2. Vulnerable populations such as pregnant patients, children, individuals with severe
             physical or mental disabilities who cannot provide meaningful consent.

          3. Active malignancy requiring treatment within the last five years.

          4. Major physical trauma in the last 5 days, including motor vehicle accidents, assaults,
             mechanical falls with sequalae of significant bleeding or craniofacial bruising, and
             surgeries.

          5. Active tuberculosis or cystic fibrosis.

          6. Severe chronic respiratory disease including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or
             pulmonary fibrosis requiring home oxygen &gt; 5L/min.

          7. Use of ECMO during the current hospitalization.

          8. Pre-existing pulmonary hypertension.

          9. Severe pre-existing hepatic impairment (presence of cirrhosis, LFTs ≥ 6x baseline, INR
             ≥ 2.0).

         10. Pre-existing stage IIIb Chronic Kidney Disease or End Stage Renal Disease prior to
             onset of COVID-19 (stage I, II, and IIIa are acceptable)

         11. Evidence of irreversible coagulopathy (e.g. frequently occluded vascular access
             despite anticoagulation,
