  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was first reported in the Hubei province of China in
      December 2019, the US has become an epicenter for the pandemic, accounting for more than
      220,000 cases and 4,800 deaths (CDC). The rapid spread of the associated disease, COVID-19,
      has overwhelmed healthcare systems in spite of unprecedented measures to reduce contagion.
      The resulting uncertainty with regard to the duration and magnitude of the pandemic and
      limited availability of resources and treatment have been detrimental to the mental health of
      frontline healthcare providers (NIH). Preserving the psychological wellbeing of these
      individuals is paramount to mitigating the effect of COVID-19 and delivering optimal patient
      care.

      Of particularly grave concern is how professional and personal distress caused by the
      COVID-19 pandemic will affect provider burnout (Lai et al. JAMA Network Open 2020).
      Professional burnout, characterized by emotional exhaustion, career de-prioritization, and
      loss of self-efficacy, represents a significant threat to the US healthcare system (Shanafelt
      et al. Ann Surg 2010; Han et al. Annals of Internal Medicine 2019). While burnout has been
      described as a reaction to chronic work-related stress (Melamed et al. Psychol. Bull. 2006),
      individual factors such as anxiety increase susceptibility to burnout (Sun et al. J Occup
      Health 2012). Although data suggests that occupational stress might amplify risk of anxiety
      (DiGiacomo and Adamson J Allied Health 2001), we have yet to understand how intensified
      anxiety among frontline providers during global health crises contributes to burnout.
      Similarly, it is unknown whether factors such as perceived organizational support (POS), a
      key driver of job satisfaction and performance (Muse and Stamper, J Managerial Issues 2007),
      modify anxiety and burnout under these circumstances. We hypothesize that diminished POS in
      response to the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with burnout and that this relationship is
      mediated by an increase in providers' anxiety. Delineating this relationship is a critical
      first step in developing interventions that ease the mental health burden of this pandemic
      and future crises for healthcare providers.

    <intervention_model_description>A longitudinal survey-based research study investigating the domains of perceived organizational support, anxiety, and burnout will take place. Healthcare providers with patient-care contact will be asked to fill out these surveys once every 30 days over a period of 6 months. After the first survey is complete, 20% of participants will be randomized to watch a 1-hour long video discussing coping strategies for stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic.</intervention_model_description>
