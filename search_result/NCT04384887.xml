      Depression and Anxiety Score after the disease regressed are planned.

      (Beck depression scale contains 10 questions and a total of 1 to 100 points is obtained. High
      score indicates that depression and anxiety are high.) 0-16 points = mild depressive symptoms

      17-29 points = moderate depressive symptoms
