        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Willing and able to provide written informed consent, or with a legal representative
             who can provide informed consent, or enrolled under International Conference on
             Harmonization (ICH) E6(R2) 4.8.15 emergency use provisions as deemed necessary by the
             investigator (age ≥18), or willing and able to provide assent (age ≥12 to &lt;18, where
             locally and nationally approved) prior to performing study procedures

          2. Patient is aged at least 18 years, enrollment of patients &lt; 65 years old will be
             limited to 20% of the total with the first 50% of enrollment conducted solely among
             those patients ≥ 55 years old.

          3. Patient has SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia from COVID-19 infection of moderate to serious
             severity (WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement score of 4 or 5)

          4. Patient has COVID-19 symptoms ≤ 10 days and at least 1 of the following:

               -  Radiographic infiltrates by imaging (chest x-ray, CT scan, etc.)

               -  O2 saturation (SpO2) ≤ 94% on room air

               -  Requiring supplemental O2 (patients on HFNO ≤ 20 L/min with FiO2 &lt; 0.5 are
                  allowed), but not requiring mechanical ventilation.

        Note: Patients admitted with immediate need for mechanical ventilation are of a severity
        too critical for inclusion into this protocol. Patients who are already in the hospital and
        have been removed from mechanical ventilation are not eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has SARS-CoV-2 infection of severity ≥ 6 on COVID-19 WHO Ordinal Scale for
             Clinical Improvement or for those subjects who have a WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical
             Improvement score of 5, nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or
             requiring HFNO &gt; 20 L/min with FiO2 ≥ 0.5 will be exclusionary.

          2. Patient is currently receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, nitric oxide
             therapy, or high-frequency oscillatory ventilation

          3. Patient is unlikely to survive for &gt; 24 hours from randomization, in the opinion of
             the investigator

          4. Patient has a history of chronic oxygen use or any pre-existing respiratory condition
             that requires intermittent or continuous ambulatory oxygen prior to hospitalization

          5. Patient has a history of venous thromboembolism, DVT, or pulmonary embolus

          6. Has taken other investigational drugs or participated in any clinical study within 30
             days or 5 half-lives (if known) of the investigational drug's PK, PD, or biological
             activity (if known), whichever is longer, prior to the first dose of study drug in
             this study or is currently participating in another clinical study.
