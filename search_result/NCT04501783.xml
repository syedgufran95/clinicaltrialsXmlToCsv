      Randomized open-label multicenter parallel-group study of efficacy and safety of TL-FVP-t vs.
      standard of care therapy in patients with mild to moderate coronavirus disease
      (SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19)

    <textblock>
      This is an open label, randomized, controlled, multicenter Phase 3 study of TL-FVP-t in
      outpatients and inpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19. After stratification by the
      severity of their disease (mild or moderate), age (18-44 or ≥ 45 years) and CT severity
      subjects will be randomized at a rate of 2:1 to receive either TL-FVP-t + standard
      concomitant therapy or standard ethiptropic therapy (standard of care - SOC) including
      standard concomitant therapy. Standard ethiptropic therapy according to MoH of Russian
      Federation includes umifenovir + intranasal recombinant interferon alpha, hydroxichloroquine,
      or chloroquine.

      The dose regimen will be the following: TL-FVP-t at a dose of 1800 mg BID on the Day 1
      followed by 800 mg BID during the next 9 days. The study will include the period of therapy
      (10 days) and follow-up period (18 days).
