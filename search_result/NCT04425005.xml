      Eligible patients will be invited to participate in the study by phone call. The research
      team will visit the included patients. All patients giving the written consent will perform
      the following tests before being randomly allocated into exercise training or control: 1)
      blood pressure; 2) anthropometric measures; 3) blood sampling; 4) handgrip test; 5) sit and
      stand test; 6) exercise capacity; 7) nutritional recalls and 8) health-related
      questionnaires. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to control group (will receive
      information to keep active and eating healthy) or exercise training group (will receive a
      telemonitored exercise program through video conference, three times a week, during 4
      months). Following 4 months of intervention, the outocomes will be re-assessed.
