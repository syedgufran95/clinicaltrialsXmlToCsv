  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the postmenopausal period when the woman spent 1/3 of her life; Due to the lack of
      estrogen, some physical and psychological changes occur. These changes may cause some
      problems. For women who perceive menopause as the first step of old age, loss of physical
      strength, energy, attraction and fertility, menopause can also lead to anxiety. In addition
      to these, they are among the emotional changes in the menopausal period in symptoms such as
      hypersensitivity to events, fatigue, and insomnia. Sometimes it can even be seen in
      psychological disorders such as melancholy and depression. The new coronavirus pneumonia
      (COVID-19), which appeared in Wuhan in December 2019, started to appear in different
      countries soon after. All countries have taken measures to prevent the spread of this virus.
      To this end, Turkey remains at home on March 21, 2020, and has commissioned social isolation
      measures. Studies investigating the effects of social isolation show that psychological and
      physical problems occur in individuals. Studies have shown that yoga and mindfulness programs
      have an impact on people's anxiety, depression, and the ability to control themselves. The
      purpose of this study; To investigate the effectiveness of telerehabilitation based yoga and
      mindfulness programs on psychological resilience, physical awareness and physical activity in
      postmenopausal women in social isolation due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Using
      telerehabilitation-based home programs aims to use an innovative model.
