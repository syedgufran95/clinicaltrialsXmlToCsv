  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective longitudinal cohort the investigators reported the clinical, and
      biological characteristics of all critically ill patients admitted in the pediatric intensive
      care unit (PICU) of Bicêtre Hospital during the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
      pandemics. Patients were older than 37 weeks of gestational age. No upper limit was set as
      the unit was transiently converted into a pediatric &quot;adult COVID-19&quot; intensive care unit.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will be monitored during their PICU stay.

      Clinical characteristics include: age, gender, co-morbidities, organ support therapies
      (mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,
      vasopressors), organ complications (pulmonary embolism, acute respiratory distress syndrome,
      renal failure, heart failure) and function, infective complications (ventilator associated
      pneumonia, central line associated bloodstream infection, pulmonary access, sepsis, septic
      shock), microbiologic and viral identification, 7-day and 28-day mortality.

      Biological characteristics include:

        -  Admission workup: qualitative and quantitative Ig, ferritin, creatinine kinase,
           complement study (C3,C4,CH50),

        -  Daily workup: blood cells count, arterial blood gas analysis, lactate, electrolytes,
           albumin, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, hemostasis (fibrinogen, factor V, II+VII,
           factor X, prothrombin time, antiXa activity, activated cephalin time, D-dimer),
           C-reactive protein, procalcitonin.

        -  Twice weekly workup: circulating cells phenotyping (T cell and subclass including Treg,
           B cell, Natural Killer cell, myeloid derived suppressor cell, neutrophils), interleukin
           6.

        -  Bone marrow analysis when indicated by attending staff.
