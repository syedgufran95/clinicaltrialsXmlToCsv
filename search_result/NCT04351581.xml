  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent data from some of the earliest and worst affected countries of COVID-19 suggest a
      major overrepresentation of hypertension and diabetes among COVID-19-related deaths and among
      patients experiencing severe courses of the disease. The vast majority of patients with
      hypertension and/or diabetes are taking drugs targeting the renin-angiotensin system (RAS)
      because of their blood pressure-lowering and/or kidney-protective effects. Importantly, the
      virus causing COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) binds to
      the transmembrane protein angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) - an important component of
      RAS - for host cell entry and subsequent viral replication. ACE2 is normally considered to be
      an enzyme that limits airway inflammation via effects in RAS and increased ACE2 activity
      seems to alleviate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Importantly, evidence from
      human studies as well as rodent studies suggests that the inhibition of RAS by angiotensin
      converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) leads to
      upregulation of ACE2, and treatment with ARB leads to attenuation of SARS-CoV-induced ARDS.
      This is of interest, as the vast majority of deaths from COVID-19 are due to ARDS and
      expression of ACE2 has previously been shown to be reduced by the binding of SARS-CoV to
      ACE2. Thus, ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been suggested to alleviate the COVID-19 pulmonary
      manifestations. In contrast to these notions, concern has been raised that ACE2 upregulation
      (by RAS-inhibiting drugs) will multiply the cellular access points for viral entry and might
      increase the risk of severe progression of COVID-19. The multiplied viral entry points could
      perhaps explain the alarmingly high morbidity and mortality among COVID-19 patients with
      diabetes and/or hypertension. Thus, a delineation of the role of RAS for the course of
      COVID-19 is of crucial importance for the management of COVID-19 patients.

      Aim:

      This randomised clinical trial will investigate whether to continue or discontinue treatment
      with ACE inhibitors or ARBs in hospitalised patients with COVID-19.
