  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has been declared global emergency with immediate safety,
      preventative and curative measures to control the spread of virus. Confirmed cases are
      treated with clinical management as they are diagnosed but so far, there is no effective
      treatment or vaccine yet for Covid-19.

      With recommended guidelines of AYUSH Ministry, India, the use of Ayurveda for Covid-19 has
      increased; however, its efficacy and safety in Covid-19 confirmed patients remain unclear.

      Present study examined the efficacy and safety of one of the recommended Ayurveda drug
      (Guduchi Ghan Vati) compared with standard care for patients with asymptomatic Covid-19
      patients.
