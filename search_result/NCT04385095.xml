  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SNG001 is an inhaled drug that contains a antiviral protein called interferon beta (IFN-β).
      IFN-β in produced in the lungs during viral lung infections. It has been shown that older
      people and people with some chronic diseases have an IFN-β deficiency. Many viruses inhibit
      IFN-β as part of their strategy to evade the immune system.

      Addition of IFN-β in vitro protects lung cells from viral infection. IFN-β protects cells
      against the MERS and SARS coronaviruses (close relatives of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes
      COVID-19).

      SNG001 is an inhaled formulation of interferon beta-1a it is currently in Phase II clinical
      trials for COPD patients.

      Synairgen has conducted randomised placebo controlled clinical trials of SNG001 involving
      &gt;200 asthma and COPD patients. These trials have shown that SNG001 has:

        -  been well tolerated during virus infections

        -  enhanced antiviral activity in the lungs (measured in sputum and blood samples)

        -  provided significant lung function benefit over placebo in asthma in two Phase II
           trials.

      Synairgen believes SNG001 could help prevent worsening or accelerate recovery of severe lower
      respiratory tract illness in COVID-19 patients.

      Patients who are in hospital or non-hospitalised but are a high risk groups (e.g. elderly or
      diabetics) will be invited to take part in the trial. The patient would receive either SNG001
      or placebo once daily for 14 days. The severity of the patients condition would be recorded
      on a scale developed by the World Health Organisation and the patient would be asked
      questions about their breathlessness, cough and sputum every day, as well as assess their
      general medical condition and safety.

      The study will start as a Pilot phase where 100 patients will be randomised in the hospital
      setting and a 120 patients randomised in the home setting.

      Once each of the Pilot phases are complete, a Pivotal phase will be conducted. It is
      estimated that the size of each of the Pivotal phases (hospital and home) will be around 100
      to 300 patients per arm. The actual number will be determined after the data review at the
      end of each of the Pilot phases.

      If SNG001 proves to be beneficial it would be a major breakthrough for the treatment of
      COVID-19.

             infection test (hospital setting only). This criterion does not apply to patients in
             the hospital setting who had their positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 performed prior
             to hospitalisation.

          2. &gt;96 hours from onset of COVID-19 symptoms (cough and/or fever and/or loss or change to
             sense of smell and/or taste; home setting only).

          3. Any condition, including findings in the patients' medical history or in the
             pre-randomisation study assessments that in the opinion of the Investigator,
             constitute a risk or a contraindication for the participation of the patient into the
             study or that could interfere with the study objectives, conduct or evaluation.

          4. Current or previous participation in another clinical trial where the patient has
             received a dose of an Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) containing small
             molecules within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to entry into
             this study or containing biologicals within 3 months prior to entry into this study.

          5. Ventilated or in intensive care.

          6. Inability to use a nebuliser with a mouthpiece.

          7. History of hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant IFN-β or to any of the
             excipients in the drug preparation.

          8. Females who are breast-feeding, lactating, pregnant or intending to become pregnant.
