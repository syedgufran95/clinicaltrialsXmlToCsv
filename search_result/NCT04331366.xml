    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the safety, feasibility and efficacy of a
      bidirectional oxygenation Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) mouthpiece in coronavirus
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients requiring supplemental oxygen by non-rebreather mask.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe cases of COVID-19 often mimic the typical course of Adult Respiratory Distress
      Syndrome (ARDS) and its predictable sequelae. These patients often require intubation and
      ventilator support in order to sustain adequate oxygenation. Once a COVID-19 patient is
      intubated, Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) is a mainstay of treatment and is used in
      order to improve lung function, treat underlying atelectasis, improve oxygenation, and
      improve survival. In fact, early clinical data as well as reports from front line physicians
      treating COVID-19 suggest that PEEP has been the most effective treatment modality. In many
      cases, PEEP has resulted in improved oxygenation and improved survival.

      PEEP decreases the propensity for the alveoli to collapse by increasing the air pressure in
      the lungs. This residual pressure in the lungs at the end of exhalation decreases shunting
      and allows for more complete gas exchange and improved oxygenation. In patients, PEEP is one
      of the safest ways to increase PaO2 and is used on almost all modern ventilator settings.

      The GO2 PEEP MOUTHPIECE is a simple, comfortable, and straightforward mouthpiece with a
      bidirectional valve that effectively delivers PEEP with every breath. Early application of
      the GO2 PEEP MOUTHPIECE in non-intubated COVID-19 patients may improve outcomes and save
      lives. Furthermore, this device may allow for less strain on limited resources, especially
      ventilators. This PEEP mouthpiece could be employed under an oxygen non-rebreather mask to
      improve oxygenation and avoid intubation.

    <measure>Change in Partial Pressure of Oxygen (PaO2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Minutes 5, 10, 15, 30 (15 minutes after treatment ends)</time_frame>
    <description>PaO2 assesses the effects of respiratory distress by measuring the pressure of oxygen dissolved in arterial blood. Normal values are greater than 80 millimeters of mercury (mmHg).</description>

    <measure>Change in Partial Pressure of Carbon Dioxide (PaCO2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Minutes 5, 10, 15, 30 (15 minutes after treatment ends)</time_frame>
    <description>PaCO2 assesses respiratory state by measuring the pressure of carbon dioxide in blood. and how well carbon dioxide is able to move out of the body. Normal values are between 35 and 45 mmHg. Values below 35 mmHg indicate too little carbon dioxide in blood while values above 45 mmHg mean there is an excess of carbon dioxide.</description>
