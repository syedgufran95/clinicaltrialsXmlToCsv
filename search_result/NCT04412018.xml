    <textblock>
      This is a 14-day long prospective, multi-site, two-armed, randomized, open-label study that
      will enroll approximately 100 adult outpatients in Canada who have received a positive
      SARS-CoV-2 test result within the preceding 72 hours. Participants will be randomized (1:1)
      to receive either icosapent ethyl (4 g BID for 3 days, then 2 g BID for the subsequent 11
      days) or usual care. Blood samples will be collected to determine if icosapent ethyl use
      lowers circulating pro-inflammatory biomarkers.
