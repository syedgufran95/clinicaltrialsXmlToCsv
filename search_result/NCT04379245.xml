  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic was declared as a global pandemic by the WHO on March 12, 2020.
      France is affected with approximately 120,000 biologically confirmed cases, as of April 30,
      2020, a figure probably very underestimated. Its distribution in different populations, in
      particular immunocompromised, has not yet been measured. The in vitro efficacy of lopinavir
      coupled with ritonavir, an HIV protease inhibitor, on SARS-CoV, responsible for SARS has been
      discussed and this therapeutic combination is currently being evaluated in patients infected
      with COVID-19. The possible protective role of treatment with Lopinavir / ritonavir or
      another HIV protease inhibitor has not been studied.

      In addition, patients receiving HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) share certain
      epidemiological and behavioral characteristics with HIV-infected patients.

      The objective was to carry out an epidemiological study aimed at determining the attack rate
      of COVID-19 infection in patients infected with HIV and or on PrEP and to analyze this attack
      rate according to the characteristics of these 2 populations and in particular the existence
      or not of an antiretroviral treatment comprising Lopinavir / Ritonavir or another inhibitor
      of the HIV protease.

      Cross-referencing of Virology Laboratory data (positive or negative screening) and
      clinical-biological data can be easily carried out using a unique identification number in
      the 2 software programs and will allow an almost exhaustive epidemiological analysis in 2
      well identified populations.
