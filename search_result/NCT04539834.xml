  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Initial case reports and cohort studies have described many clinical characteristics of
      patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an emerging infectious disorder caused by
      the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In early COVID-19 studies,
      some evidence has been provided that electrolyte disorders may also be present upon patients'
      presentation, including sodium, potassium, chloride and calcium abnormalities

      the aim of the study is Identification of elements that affect COVID-19 pathology to improve
      survival and decrease mortality rate.

      SARS-CoV-2 invades human cells through binding angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on
      the cell membrane. ACE2 is widely distributed in many types of human tissues, especially in
      the vital organs, such as heart, liver, kidney, and lungs. ACE2 is viewed as the principal
      counter-regulatory mechanism for the main axis of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that is an
      essential player in the control of blood pressure and electrolyte balance. The final effect
      is to increase reabsorption of sodium and water, and thereafter increase blood pressure and
      excretion of potassium (K+). Besides, patients with COVID-19 often had gastrointestinal
      symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting

      Early studies proved that high percentage of COVID-19 patient were presented with electrolyte
      disorders, including sodium, potassium, chloride and calcium abnormalities. Such electrolyte
      disturbances have important implications not only for patient management but also for
      identifying potential pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying COVID-19 that could drive novel
      therapeutic opportunities
