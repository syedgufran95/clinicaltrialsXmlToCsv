  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 outbreak is often lethal. Mortality has been associated with several cardio-vascular
      risk factors such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension and tobacco use. Other
      clinico-biological features predictive of mortality or transfer to Intensive Care Unit are
      also needed. Cases of myocarditis have also been reported with COVID-19.

      Cardio-vascular events have possibly been highly underestimated. The study proposes to
      systematically collect cardio-vascular data to study the incidence of myocarditis and
      coronaropathy events during COVID-19 infection.We will also assess predictive factors for
      transfer in Intensive Care Unit or death.
