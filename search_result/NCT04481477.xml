  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to find out what care patients affected by anxiety, fear or
      loneliness have perceived and the perceived impact of this care. This knowledge will allow us
      to design measures aimed at improving nursing care of these aspects in the future.

      This is a cross-sectional descriptive study to be carried out at the Consorci Corporació
      Sanitària Parc Taulí (CCSPT). The results of this study will provide information on the care
      received by patients admitted to COVID 19 affected by anxiety, fear or loneliness, the
      perceived impact of this care and will enable measures to be implemented to improve nursing
      care in the future. 450 patients, randomly selected from the Hospital de Sabadell database,
      will be included. In the sample, we will ensure that the proportion of women and men is in
      line with the distribution of the population to enable the incorporation of the gender
      perspective in the analyses. The quantitative variables will be described by means of their
      mean and standard deviation. Qualitative variables will be described in absolute and relative
      frequencies. In order to evaluate the suitability of the intervention to the needs of the
      patient, a table of concordance will be constructed between the actions proposed by the panel
      of experts and the actions carried out as referred by the patient. The kappa concordance
      index will be calculated and the degree of concordance will be classified according to the
      Landis and Koch scale. As regards the effectiveness of the intervention, the patients who
      were treated correctly and those who were not will be identified, and the percentage of
      positive impacts according to Csq-8 between the two groups will be compared by means of the
      Chi-square test.
