  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium and acute neurocognitive impairment are increasingly observed in adult and pediatric
      patients with COVID-19. Prospective clinical studies combining clinical and laboratory
      examinations including specific biomarkers of neuroaxonal injury were not performed for
      COVID-19. The value of biomarkers of neuroaxonal injury was proven in preliminary studies.
      These biomarkers could thus contribute to the systematic detection of neurocognitive
      impairment in patients with COVID-19. Due to worldwide increasing numbers of hospitalized
      patients with COVID-19, biomarkers of neuroaxonal injury are highly valuable to detect and
      monitor cognitive impairment, especially with regard to limited resources available to
      perform time-consuming brain imaging.

      Biomarkers of neuroaxonal injury are therefore not only of great interest to detect
      neurocognitive impairment but also to quantify the severity of brain injury in patients with
      COVID-19.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter observational study evaluating the incidence and severity of
      neurocognitive impairment in adult and pediatric patients with COVID-19. All study
      participants will be assessed by clinical and neurological examination as well as
      comprehensive laboratory tests using biomarkers of neuroaxonal injury at study day 1 (day of
      study inclusion), day 3, day 7 and day of hospital discharge. A panel of biomarkers (among
      others NSE, S100B and neurofilament proteins) will be measured. Clinical assessment will be
      performed using validated delirium tests (among others CAM-ICU, ICDSC) and scales to assess
      the neurocognitive performance of study participants before and three months after study
      inclusion (among others Short Blessed Test).

      A group of patients with a comparable severity of disease but without the detection of
      SARS-Cov-2 will serve as control group and will undergo the same clinical and laboratory
      examinations.

      We hypothesize, that:

        -  patients with COVID-19 are more likely to develop delirium and neurocognitive impairment
           than patients without COVID-19

        -  patients with a preexisting neurocognitive deficit are more vulnerable to neurocognitive
           impairment in the course of COVID-19 than patients without a preexisting neurocognitive
           deficit

        -  Specific biomarkers of neuroaxonal injury correlate with the clinical severity of acute
           neurocognitive impairment and can predict the 3-month neurocognitive outcome of patients
           with COVID-19
