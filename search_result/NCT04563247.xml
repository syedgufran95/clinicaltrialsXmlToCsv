  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is about the current knowledge on the immunological changes observed in various
      healthcare workers in this part of the world, who remained asymptomatic while working in high
      exposure areas of COVID-19 infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, single positive-strand RNA viruses belonging to the large
      subfamily Coronavirinae, which can infect mammals and several other animals.The continued
      spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has prompted widespread concern around the
      world, and the World Health Organization (WHO), on 11 March 2020, declared COVID-19 a
      pandemic. Studies on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory
      syndrome (MERS) showed that virus-specific antibodies were detectable in 80-100% of patients
      at 2 weeks after symptom onset. Currently, the antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 remain
      poorly understood and the clinical utility of serological testing is unclear. Little is known
      about the kinetics, tissue distribution, cross-reactivity and neutralization antibody
      response in COVID-19 patients. Asymptomatic cases are common but to date there are scarce
      epidemiological surveys that provide a clear percentage of asymptomatic cases.

      A large number of healthcare workers have been infected with the virus worldwide, presenting
      with severe symptoms to no symptoms at all, in which case being diagnosed on contact tracing
      only. The seropositivity rate in previously undiagnosed healthcare workers has been reported
      in different regions of the world. In a combined study of three hospitals of Turkey, the
      seropositivity rate of the previously undiagnosed HCWs was 2.7%. A study done in China
      revealed 17.5 % seropositivity rate.

      This study will aim to comprehensively review the current knowledge on the immunological
      changes observed in various healthcare workers in this part of the world, who remained
      asymptomatic while working in high exposure areas of COVID-19 infection.
