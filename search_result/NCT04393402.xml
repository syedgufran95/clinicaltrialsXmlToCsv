      It might be necessary with Sars-Cov2 pneumopathy patient to repeat thoracic images, the
      tomodensitometry ones in particular. This task is difficult and nearly impossible for several
      reasons: respiratory and hemodynamic unstable patient, prone position and due to the high
      contagious nature of the disease.

      The lung ultrasound is an easy tool, fast (between 5 and 10 minutes) and as a limited
      training.

      In the context of the Sars-Cov2 epidemic, Buonsenso and al case report depict the first lung
      ultrasound for a Covid 19 patient.

      Peng and al in Intensive Care Medicine accentuate the usefulness of this particular technic.

      In the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, a study has been published
      as a point-of-care, in which the doctors reported using the lung ultrasound with intensive
      and critical care patient.

      In Critical Care 2016, it has been showed that ultrasound allowed with neat precisions, to
      predict severe ARDS patient response to the prone position, all-cause.

      Another researchers team found a good correlation between lung ultrasound, the SOFA, APACHE
      II, CPIS score, and patient mortality.

      And a new applicability in the pulmonary recruitment by PEEP titration has been presented.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the lung ultrasound in Covid19 ARDS.

    <description>In dorsal position, or in prone position, the two hemithorax will be subdivided in 6 parts, and a score will be attributed with the following criteria : A-Lines (0 point), &gt; 3 B-lines (1 point), B-Lines coalscent (2 points), and pulmonary consolidation (3 points). For the echography we can use a convexe sonde, or a &quot;cardiac&quot; sonde.</description>
