  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the utility of the PCL Rapid Antigen Test for Coronavirus
      (COVID-19) in a real world clinical setting. The PCL test has completed laboratory validation
      and holds a European CE marking for in vitro diagnostic devices. These tests have been made
      available to South West Pathology Services as a donation in kind by iPP (Integrated Pathology
      Partnership). They have been widely used in South Korea.

      This study will test the practical delivery of the test in terms of time constraints and
      error rates. We will also compare the objective performance to the current standard
      diagnostic test for COVID-19 and against a proven serological antibody test when a suitable
      reference testing becomes available.

      We will recruit patients having a SARS CoV-2 PCR swab test and ask for consent to test them
      with the PCL antigen test in parallel. We aim to study 200 patients split across three sites;
      Musgrove Park Hospital, Basildon University Hospital and Southend University Hospital. The
      results will not be used to guide clinical decision making. Patients having a COVID PCR test
      will be asked to read the patient information sheet and asked if they would like to
      participate. The patients will be asked to have a second nasal/throat swab taken shortly
      after their swab for the PCR test.

      Written informed consent will be taken for whole blood or plasma left over from any routine
      clinical sample to be stored as anonymised samples for future testing once a reference test
      becomes available.

      We will report results of the onsite clinical diagnostic test and the PCL antigen test with
      the number of the kit used, and test date. Anonymised information about year of birth, gender
      and place of testing will be collected alongside date of onset, symptoms and immunodeficiency
      status or significant conditions.

      Participants will be identified as they attend assessment areas or testing facilities hosted
      by the recruiting NHS centres. They will be screened by clinical staff and identified to the
      research team.

      Consent will be taken by a clinical staff member or research staff member with the aim of
      reducing the number of contacts with the patients and minimising the usage of personal
      protective equipment.

      The consent form gives the patient the opportunity to ask further questions. Only those that
      are able to consent for themselves will be recruited for this trial.

      We want to allow patients as long as possible to make a decision to participate but we feel
      it is important if possible that the swab samples are taken during the same patient contact
      (reducing PPE usage and minimising additional staff exposures). However there should not be
      undue delay to clinical testing therefore we propose if due to clinical urgency potential
      participants do not have sufficient time to consider the patient information sheet and
      discuss the trial prior to the PCR swab being taken they can have up to 24 hours to consider
      this information and participate if they wish to.

      Consent will be taken by a clinical staff member or research staff member reducing the number
      of contacts with the patients. They will then be assigned a trial number used to identify
      them during the trial. The consent form that will be photocopied and reprinted on clean
      paper, with the original staying with the patient. The clean copy will be stored in the
      patient's notes and the case record file.

      The current standard COVID PCR swab will be taken and a second swab taken immediately after
      for use in the rapid antigen test. As the swab process can be uncomfortable after the first
      swab is taken for the standard clinical test (PCR) the participant's consent will be
      confirmed again prior to taking the second swab required for the antigen test. After consent
      the research team will complete an anonymised data case record form from the notes and
      clinical management database. Participant's year of birth and date of onset of symptoms if
      symptomatic will be documented.

      From routine blood samples taken by phlebotomy or clinical staff consent will be sort to
      store a leftover sample. This will be processed and stored by research laboratory staff. This
      will be stored in an anonymised secure research freezer.

      In the laboratory their swab for the PCL COVID19 Ag rapid FIA will be run on the test
      platform. Following the test the swab will be destroyed as per local guidelines for
      contaminated items. This will performed by dedicated research laboratory scientists.
      Participant's results from this antigen test will not be used to make clinical decisions. We
      will not be able to feedback participants' individual results.

      Participants are expected to be in the study for total of 20 minutes total although this will
      be spread over their patient journey so they have sufficient time to read the information
      leaflet and ask questions.
