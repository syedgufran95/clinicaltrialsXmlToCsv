    <textblock>
      The purpose of this data repository is to provide a secure and centralized storage location
      and resource for the collection of essential data and medical specimens, across COVID-19
      related protocols at Duke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this data repository is to provide a secure and centralized storage location and
      resource for the collection of core variables of interest, as well as the retaining of
      relevant patient samples, across COVID-19 related protocols at Duke. The core data variables
      were in-part selected to specifically match those agreed upon by Academic Medical Centers
      across the U.S., with the intention of aiding the efficiency and effectiveness of
      de-identified data reuse for population-level research. An additional benefit is that
      centralized, shared data storage of demographic and longitudinal variables will reduce
      subject burden, as many questions will now only need to be asked once, rather than each time
      a given subject joins another COVID-19 related study at Duke.

      This shared data and bio-repository project will house all the core data for all patients
      with COVID-19 (or suspected cases), as well as individual participants ICFs for all other
      participating COVID-19 studies enrolling Duke patients. Each participating study will have
      its own separate IRB approved protocol. Samples may be either collected specifically by the
      protocol, or include left-over clinical samples from the testing and treatment of patients
      with COVID-19 at Duke.
