  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in an international shortage of the nasopharyngeal (NP)
      swabs used to collect sample for virological testing. This shortage has become a crisis as
      testing capacity is growing, and threatens to become the bottleneck at University of Virginia
      Health System and in the Commonwealth of Virginia, as it already is in other testing centers.
      To resolve this crisis, a team in the Clinical Microbiology Laboratories at University of
      Virginia Medical Center has been working closely with biomedical engineers in the University
      of Virginia (UVA), School of Engineering and with high volume domestic manufacturers
      developing injection molded polypropylene flocked nylon NP swab.

      This prototype will be tested for non-inferiority relative to existing, already validated NP
      swabs (&quot;control swab&quot;) for purposes of molecular microbiology: i.e. the polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) tests used for virological testing for SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, the
      nasopharynx of patients with Covid-19 and patients under investigation (PUI) for Covid-19,
      the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, will be swabbed using a prototype swab and a control swab
      (the standard of care swab), and test for concordance of SARS-CoV-2. In all cases the swab
      will be transported in validated FDA cleared viral transport medium (VTM) as per standard
      operating procedure at University of Virginia Medical Center.
