  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether Fisetin, a senolytic drug, can assist in
      preventing an increase in the disease's progression and alleviate complications of
      coronavirus due to an excessive inflammatory reaction.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine if Fisetin treatment can prevent deterioration of oxygenation status as measured
      by S/F ratio: SpO2/ FiO2, as well as prevent deterioration in physical function (frailty) and
      hyper-inflammation, other measures of oxygenation status (progression to supplemental oxygen
      requirement, assisted breathing/ ventilation), and progression from mild/ moderate to severe/
      critical proven COVID-19 (CoV) infection (WHO/NIH Baseline Severity Classification) in
      non-ICU hospitalized patients and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Fisetin in this
      patient population.
