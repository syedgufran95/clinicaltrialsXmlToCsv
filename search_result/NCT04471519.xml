      Phase 1 study

      The study is designed to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, tolerability, and
      immunogenicity of Four arms of healthy volunteers who receive two intramuscular doses of
      BBV152 vaccine formulations or Placebo. A total no of 375 subjects will be enrolled in 4:1
      ratio.

      This study will be conducted in a dose escalatory manner with a two-dose regimen fourteen
      days apart.

      Phase 2 study

      The study is designed to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, tolerability, and
      immunogenicity of two arms of healthy volunteers who will receive two intramuscular doses of
      BBV152 vaccine formulations (BBV152-A &amp; BBV152-B) in a 1:1 ratio with dosage schedule on Day
