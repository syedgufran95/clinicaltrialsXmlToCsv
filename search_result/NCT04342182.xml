  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Passive immunization with immunoglobulins is occasionally used as therapy for the treatment
      of viral infectious diseases. Immunoglobulins are used for the treatment of CMV disease, and
      is effective as prophylaxis when given soon after exposure to varicella zoster virus, rabies,
      and hepatitis B virus.

      Neutralizing antibodies against MERS, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to be present
      in patients previously infected with MERS, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 respectively. During the
      2003 SARS outbreak in Hong-Kong,a non-randomized study in hospitalized SARS patients showed
      that treatment with convalescent plasma (convP) from SARS-recovered donors significantly
      increased the day 22 discharge rate and decreased mortality. A study in non-human primates
      showed that rhesus macaques could not be re-infected with SARS-CoV-2 after primary infection.

      With no proven effective therapy against COVID, this study will evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of convalescent plasma from COVID-recovered donors as a treatment for hospitalized
      patients with symptomatic COVID-19. The study will focus on patients who tested positive for
      SARS-CoV-2 in the last 96 hours before inclusion

      Primary objectives

      • Decrease overall mortality in patients within COVID disease

      Study design:

      This trial is a randomized comparative trial. Patients will be randomized between the
      infusion of 300mL of convP with standard of care.

      Patient population:

      Patients with PCR confirmed COVID disease, age &gt;18 years Donors will be included with a known
      history of COVID who have been asymptomatic for at least 14 days.

      Intervention: 300mL of convP Duration of treatment: ConvP will be given as a one-time
      infusion Duration of follow up: For the primary endpoint: until discharge or death before day
      60, whichever comes first. For the secondary endpoints (with separate consent) up to 1 year.

      Target number of patients: 426 Target number of donors: 100 Expected duration of accrural: 36
      months

      Secondary (exploratory) objectives

        -  Evaluate the effect of 300ml convP on hospital stay

        -  Evaluate the change of the 8-point WHO COVID19 disease severity scale on day 15 and 30

        -  Evaluate the change of the 8-point WHO COVID19 disease severity scale on day 15 in the
           subgroup of patients with a baseline neutralizing antibody titer (PRNT50) &lt;80

        -  Evaluate the effect of 300ml convP on mortality in patients admitted to the ICU

        -  Evaluate the effect of 300ml plasma therapy on hospital days for patients admitted to
           the ICU within 24 hours after admission

        -  Evaluate the impact of plasma therapy on the decrease in SARS-CoV2 shedding from airways

        -  Evaluate the difference in effect of convP on mortality in patients with a duration of
           symptoms &lt; or &gt; the median duration of symptoms in the study population

        -  Evaluate the impact of CTL and NK cell immunity on the likelihood of being protected
           from immune serum transfer

        -  Safety of convP therapy

        -  Evaluate the impact of covP on long-term lung function
