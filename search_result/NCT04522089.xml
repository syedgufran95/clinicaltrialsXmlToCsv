    <description>AdimrSC-2f is a candidate vaccine against COVID-19 developed by Adimmune Corporation (Adimmune). Using the baculovirus-insect cells expression system, the recombinant receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is amplified and purified. AdimrSC-2f is formulated in the different dosages of Spike (S) protein without/with aluminum content as adjuvant.</description>
