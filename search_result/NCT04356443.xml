  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study uses the AirGo band to monitor changes in tidal ventilation in spontaneously
      breathing patients with COVID-19 associated respiratory failure. It aims to recognize
      patterns of ventilation associated with worsening respiratory failure in this patient
      population. If successful, this study will lead to the development of new robust methods for
      real-time, continuous monitoring of respiratory function in patients with respiratory
      failure. In turn, such monitoring methods may enable improvements in the medical management
      of respiratory failure and timing of interventions.
