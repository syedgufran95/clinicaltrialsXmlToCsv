  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is devoted to the comparative analysis of the data received in patients with
      COVID-19 lung pathology using the method of probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy of
      distal airways and two reference methods: high resolution computed tomography and morphology
      (in some patients).

    <measure>Number of COVID-19 Participants With Notable Differences in the pCLE images in comparison with the pCLE images of non-COVID-19 Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>up to one year</time_frame>
    <description>pCLE images are assessed morphometrically. Such criteria as quantity of alveolar macrophages, quantity of floating intraalveolar substances etc. are measured using a 6-point score, where zero means the absence of the symptom and 5 means the maximal expressiveness. Thickness of interalveolar septum, diameter of microvessels and thickness of elastic fibers are measured using a special tool with the included software for the endomicroscopic system. Radiologic signs e.g. low-density areas and consolidation areas are assessed in Hounsfield Units. Other radiologic signs e.g. groundglass opacity, crazy paving patterns etc. are measured by a 5-point scale, where zero means the absence of the symptom and 4 means the maximal expressiveness. The morphological analysis of the lung tissue specimens (received as a result of autopsy/transbronchial biopsy) is made according to the structures in pCLE images for 20 fields of view.</description>

    <description>Cohort 1: COVID-19 patients. Cohort 2: patients with lung diseases unrelated to COVID-19.
All the patients will be examined using confocal laser endomicroscopy during bronchoscopy with a special Alveoflex miniprobe during the hospitalisation period. Records will be done and analysed prospectively with the included software for the endomicroscopic system.
Using Alveoflex is a minimally invasive intervention.</description>
