      hospitalized patients with pneumonia derived from COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-19)
      Experimental group: 196 patients received nitazoxanide 500mg 8 / 8 hours for 5 days. Control
      group: 196 patients received placebo 8/8 hours for 5 days.

      Population: Patients with clinical symptoms of COVID-19: dyspnoea and/or fever and/or cough)

    <intervention_model_description>Hospitalized patients with clinical signs of COVID-19, and either chest tomography scans suggestive of COVID-19 or confirmed by RT-PCR molecular tests, will be randomly divided into 2 groups: experimental and control groups.
Experimental group: 250 hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 derived pneumonia will receive nitazoxanide 500mg 8/8 hs for 5 days. Control group: 250 hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 derived pneumonia will receive placebo 8/8 hs for 5 days.</intervention_model_description>
