  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is called COVID-19. In most cases, COVID-19 presents
      as a mild to moderate respiratory illness. But it can also be more severe and even lead to
      death.

      The purpose of this study is to:

        -  Determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 carrier status over time in children and parents

        -  Determine the prevalence of antibody development over time in children and parents

        -  Compare carrier status and antibody development for children with asthma and/or other
           atopic conditions (e.g. eczema) versus children without asthma and/or other atopic
           conditions

        -  Investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in historical samples from enrolled
           participants

      The study population will include children that are participants in NIH-funded cohort studies
      and their families (household contacts).The intent is to recruit families that have
      experience with the collection of respiratory samples.

      The objective of this surveillance study is to identify the rate of infection in children and
      what, if any effect, atopy has on the SARS-CoV-2 carrier status.

      The initial surveillance interval for participants will be 6 months and, depending upon the
      findings, may be extended. During surveillance, biological samples will be collected by the
      family at established intervals and symptom and exposure surveys will be completed remotely
      via a smart phone, on-line, or phone communications at the time the biological samples are
      collected.

        NIH-funded study participants (index participants) and their families This includes
        participants who have asthma and/or other atopic or allergic conditions, as well as healthy
        index participants, all with extensive medical information and information on atopic and
        allergic status available as a result of their participation in an NIH-funded study. As
        many of these are birth cohort studies, there is extensive information available on the
        parents. The majority of the families have experience with collection of respiratory
        samples and completing respiratory questionnaires.
