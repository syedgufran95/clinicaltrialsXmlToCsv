  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of brainstem dysfunction in
      critically ill ventilated and deeply sedated patients hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit
      (ICU) for a SARS-CoV-s2 infection.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The recent development of the pandemic due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus has showed that a
      substantial proportion of patients developed a severe condition requiring critical care,
      notably because of acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation and
      deep sedation. Outside of this coronavirus infection, this situation is classically
      associated with a high prevalence of brainstem dysfunction, even in the absence of brain
      injury. This dysfunction, either structural or functional, can be detected using appropriate
      clinical tools such as the BRASS score and/or using the quantitative analysis of EKG and EEG.
      Crucially, brainstem dysfunction is associated not only with ICU complications such as
      delirium, but also with a poorer survival.

      Moreover, some reports of encephalitis cases and the presence of anosmia/agueusia raised the
      question of whether the virus could directly invade the central nervous system.

      For these two reasons, it is reasonable to assume that brainstem dysfunction is particularly
      prevalent in critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and that this dysfunction could
      be one of the major determinant of patients outcome.
