  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an urgent need to understand the outcomes of COVID-19 infected patients regarding
      the thromboembolic venous disease. Capturing real-world data and sharing Spanish national
      experience will inform the management of this complex group of patients, improving their
      clinical care.

      Interventions are needed to reduce both the incidence and severity of COVID-19. Although it
      shares characteristics with other similar viruses that also arose in outbreaks, the
      physiological mechanisms of the virus and its responses on the host are not yet fully known.
      There are indications that the clinical picture of this disease is in a procoagulant state,
      with possible increase in episodes of thromboembolic disease. This study aims to analyze the
      influence of COVID-19 on the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in lower and upper
      limbs, and the variation in the clinical presentation of COVID-19, as well as to provide new
      evidence applicable to the clinical management of these patients and the establishment of
      prognostic factors that help early take therapeutic decisions.

      To this end, an observational, multicenter, national cohorts study will be carried out,
      sponsored by the Spanish Society of Angiology and Vascular Surgery (SEACV) and the Spanish
      Chapter of Phlebology and Linfology through its Vascular Research Network (RIV), which will
      collect demographic variables, comorability, concomitant treatment, analytical status and
      complementary and ultrasound diagnostic tests, parameters of clinical evolution, therapeutic
      and complications and mortality to 30 days. All national centers you wish to participate
      through a secure server that will be accessed through the SEACV and CEFyL website.

      The global community has recognised that rapid dissemination and completion of studies in
      COVID-19 infected patients is a high priority, so we encourage all stakeholders (local
      investigators, ethics committees, IRBs) to work as quickly as possible to approve this
      project.

      This investigator-led, non-commercial, non-interventional study is extremely low risk, or
      even zero risk. This study does not collect any patient identifiable information (including
      no dates) and data will not be analysed at hospital-level.
