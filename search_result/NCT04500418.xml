  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test Cenicriviroc (CVC) as a means to reduce the severity of the
      lung disease COVID-19 caused by an infection with SARS-CoV-2. The safety of CVC, when
      administered to COVID-19 patients, will also be assessed. Furthermore, the clinical trial
      aims to answer the question of whether patients with pre-existing conditions, who have an
      increased risk of severe COVID-19 progression, benefit more and particularly from CVC. CVC is
      an orally available dual inhibitor of the chemokine receptors CCR2 and CCR5, which is
      expected to reduce (hyper-) inflammation in COVID-19.

      The main goal of the study is to determine whether CVC helps increase the number of patients
      who are symptom-free and not hospitalized after 14 days compared to a placebo. Approximately
      66.7% of the patients enrolled in the study will receive CVC and 33.3% will get an optically
      identical pill (placebo).

      Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. Discharged patients will be asked to
      attend study visits at Days 8, 15, 22, and 29 and 85. All subjects will undergo a series of
      clinical, safety, and laboratory assessments. Blood samples and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs will
      be obtained on Day 1; 3, 5 (while hospitalized); and Day 8, 15 and 29 (if able to return to
      clinic or still hospitalized). The presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies will be determined
      on Days 29 and 85.
