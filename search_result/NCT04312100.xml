  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All patients with COVID-19 were divided into three groups according to their illness: mild
      patient who receive conventional oxygen therapy, severe patients who receive nasal high flow
      oxygen inhalation or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation，all the oxygen therapy will
      be used as part of the standard of care. Each group will enroll 10 patients, the treatment of
      all patients will be continuously optimized during observation, and the incidence of
      respiratory failure, intubation rate, 28 day mortality rate, ICU hospitalization days, etc
      will be recorded and analyzed so to optimize the treatment time window of sequential oxygen
      therapy
