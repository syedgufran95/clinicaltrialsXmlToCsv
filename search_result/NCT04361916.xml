  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Starting an early home management and monitoring of patients with suspected or confirmed
      COVID-19 to ensure a rapid and adequate transfer to hospital care.

      Assess the feasibility of home monitoring in a pilot study to possibly extend it to a larger
      scale.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include adult patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 for whom home care
      is considered appropriate.

      Trained health workers will conduct home care monitoring of pulmonary performance using
      oximetry, Quick Walk Test and Single Breath Count.

      Monitoring will be done daily until disappearance of symptoms or hospitalization which will
      be requested by health workers or study coordination board on the basis of the monitoring
      results (blood oxygen level SpO2&lt; 90% OR SpO2&gt; 90% with desaturation index of at least 5% at
      Quick Walk Test)
