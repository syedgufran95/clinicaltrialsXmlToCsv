  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aeronautical community was also affected and greatly impacted economically and socially
      by the Covid-19 pandemic. Away from the acute phase, the epidemiological impact and the
      consequences of this disease within the French aviation flight crew population must be
      assessed. This study is aimed at providing original epidemiological data among civil and
      military aircrew, prior to possible prevention strategies or countermeasures to optimize risk
      management in terms of aviation safety and to promote, if necessary, future targeted studies.
