  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as an open observational non-comparative study of Polyoxidonium®,
      lyophilizate for solution for injections, 12 mg in hospitalized patients with coronavirus
      disease (COVID-19).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was planned as an observation of Polyoxidonium® administered in addition to Russian
      MoH guidance for standard COVID-19 treatment. Regimens have no limitations to the use of
      concomitant therapy. The aim of the study is to observe the safety and efficacy of
      Polyoxidonium®, lyophilizate for solution for injections, 12 mg in addition to complex
      treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
