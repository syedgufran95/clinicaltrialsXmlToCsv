  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy and
      safety of tradipitant 85 mg orally given twice daily to treat inflammatory lung injury
      associated with severe or critical COVID-19 infection.

      On evaluation for enrollment, participant will need to meet all inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. If participant consents, they will be randomized 1:1 to treatment with either
      tradipitant 85 mg PO BID or placebo in addition to standard of care for COVID-19 infection as
      per the protocol at the treating hospital. NEWS 2 will be assessed at screening and daily
      following randomization. Inflammatory lab markers as detailed should be collected once per
      day in the morning, preferably at the same time every morning. All enrolled participants will
      have whole blood collected for whole genome sequencing.
