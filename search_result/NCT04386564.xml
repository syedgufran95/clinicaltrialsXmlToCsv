      The authors hypothesize that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can affect the kidneys, causing them to be
      damaged. The present study aims to explain the mechanisms of kidney injury in patients
      diagnosed with COVID-19.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, an outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the
      SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan, China. It has spread rapidly to other
      areas in China and worldwide. The most common manifestations of COVID-19 included fever, dry
      cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Complications (acute
      respiratory distress syndrome, shock, acute cardiac injury, secondary infection, and acute
      kidney injury) and death may occur in severe cases. Recent reports showed that extrapulmonary
      symptoms (intestinal symptoms in 10-20% of patients) and renal failure in some patients may
      be associated with the interaction of the virus with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2)
      receptors in other organs. It was suggested that ACE-2 expression in the kidneys can be the
      cause of kidney injury occurring in a number of patients with SARS-CoV-2.However, ACE-2 is
      not the only possible cause of kidney injury - sepsis-related cytokine storm can also lead to
      damage of kidney parenchyma.

      The present study aims to explain the mechanisms of kidney injury in patients diagnosed with
      COVID-19.
