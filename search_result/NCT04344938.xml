  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many critical ethical questions arise in pandemic covid 19planning, preparedness and
      response. These include: Who will get priority access to medications, vaccines and intensive
      care unit beds, given the potential shortage of these essential resources? In the face of a
      pandemic, what obligations do health-care workers have to work not withstanding risks to
      their own health and the health of their families? How can surveillance, isolation,
      quarantine and social-distancing measures be undertaken in a way that respects ethical norms?
      What obligations do countries have to one another with respect to pandemic covid 19 planning
      and response efforts?
