  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is observational study to assess the prognosis of patients hospitalized with COVID-19
      confirmed by RT-PCR and exposed to trimethylxanthine (TMX).

      Trimethylxanthine is the active molecule present in coffee. Due to the lack of etiologic
      treatments and considering interest about old treatments as an avenue for research, we
      conducted a comparative study aiming to evaluate the effect of 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine on
      COVID-19 infected patients. This is actually a study about methodology.

      The objective of this study is therefore not to demonstrate the effect of the substance on
      the disease but the importance of a rigorous methodology in scientific research. This project
      is called &quot;Method and Teaching of Scientific Studies&quot;.
