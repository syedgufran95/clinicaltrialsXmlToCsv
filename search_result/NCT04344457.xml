  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently there are no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs specifically for
      the treatment of patients with COVID-19. At present, clinical management includes infection
      prevention and control measures, as well as supportive care, including supplementary oxygen
      and mechanical ventilatory support when indicated. An array of drugs approved for other
      indications as well as several investigational drugs are being studied in several hundred
      clinical trials that are underway across the globe; however, currently there are no clinical
      trials available to patients in Arizona.

      This study will determine if a specific drug cocktail can improve clinical outcomes in
      patients with confirmed Mild SARS-CoV-2

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 has become a massive threat to public health worldwide. Current estimates suggest
      that the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is both highly contagious (estimated reproductive
      rate, 2-3) and five to fifty-fold more lethal than seasonal influenza (estimated mortality
      rate, 0.5-5%); therefore, interventions to decrease the incidence and severity of COVID-19
      are emergently needed. In Maricopa County there has yet to be a clinical trial to evaluate
      people who are SARS-CoV-2 positive with mild symptoms. This study will measure the
      improvement of COVID-19 disease status as measured by time (days) required from initiation of
      treatment to improvement of clinical status from mild to symptom free on 14 days of a
      cocktail therapy of Hydroxychloroquine, Indomethacin and Zithromax.
