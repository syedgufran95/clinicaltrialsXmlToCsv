  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early inhibition of entry and replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a very promising therapeutic approach. Polyclonal neutralizing
      antibodies offers many advantages such as providing immediate immunity, consequently blunt an
      early pro-inflammatory pathogenic endogenous antibody response and lack of drug-drug
      interactions1-3.

      Because a suboptimal endogenous early antibody response with regard to SARS-CoV-2 replication
      in severe cases is observed, neutralising antibody treatment can be very interesting for
      patient with COVID-19 induced moderate pneumonia4,5. Convalescent plasma to treat infected
      patients is therefore an interesting therapeutic option currently under evaluation. However,
      the difficulties of collecting plasma and its safety aspects are not adapted to many
      patients.

      A new polyclonal humanized anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies (XAV-19) is being developed by
      Xenothera, which can be administered as intravenous treatment. XAV-19 is a heterologous swine
      glyco-humanized polyclonal antibody (GH-pAb) raised against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2,
      inhibiting infection of ACE-2 positive human cells with SARS-CoV-2. Pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic studies have been performed in preclinical models including primates and a
      First In Human study with another fully representative GH-pAb from Xenothera is ongoing in
      volunteer patients recipients of a kidney graft. These studies indicated that 5 consecutive
      administrations of GH-pAbs can be safely performed in humans.

      The objective of this 2-steps phase 2 randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study is 1)
      to define the optimal and safety XAV-19 dose to administrate in patients with COVID-19
      induced moderate pneumonia ; 2) to show the clinical benefit of selected dose of XAV-19 when
      administered to patients with COVID-19 induced moderate pneumonia.
