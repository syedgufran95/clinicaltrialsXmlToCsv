  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The administration of Calcifediol in patients with COVID-19, will reduce the development of
      SARS and the worsening of the various phases of the syndrome. Reducing at least 25% in ICU
      admission and death from the process, reducing days of hospitalization, facilitating the
      recovery of the same, acting significantly and positively, in any of its phases throughout
      the natural history of illness.

      As a treatment with extensive experience of clinical use, safe, inexpensive, and potentially
      very effective, it will have a highly efficient cost-benefit impact on the prevention of
      SARS.
