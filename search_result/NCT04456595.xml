    <textblock>
      This is a phase III clinical trial to assess efficacy and safety of the Adsorbed COVID-19
      (inactivated) vaccine manufactured by Sinovac in health care professionals.

      The study will be double-blind placebo-controlled trial with participants randomly allocated
      1:1 to placebo and vaccine arms.

      The immunization schedule is two doses intramuscular injections (deltoid) with a 14-days
      interval.

      For efficacy, the study aims to detect COVID-19 cases, defined as symptomatic SARS-CoV-2
      infections, after the second week post-immunization schedule.

      For safety and immunogenicity, participants are categorized in two age groups, Adults (18-59
      years) and Elderly (60 years and above). Safety database aims to detect adverse reactions
      with frequency of 1:1000 or higher in adults and 1:500 in elderly.

      All participants will be followed up to 12 months. Interim preliminary efficacy analysis can
      be triggered by reaching the target number of 150 cases.

             methods in the three months following vaccination;

          2. History of COVID-19 or positive serology for SARS-CoV-2;

          3. Evidence of uncontrolled active neurological, cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or renal
             disease as per case history and/or physical examination;

          4. Compromised immune system diseases including: cancer (except basal cell carcinoma),
             congenital or acquired immune deficiencies and uncontrolled autoimmune diseases, as
             per case history and/or physical examination;

          5. Behavioral, cognitive or psychiatric disease that, in the opinion of the principal
             investigator or his or her representative physician, affects the participant's ability

          6. Any alcohol or drug abuse over the 12 months prior to enrollment in the study that has
             caused medical, professional or family problems, indicated by clinical history;

          7. History of severe allergic reactions or anaphylaxis to the study vaccine or to
             components thereof;

          8. History of asplenia;

          9. Participation in another clinical trial with an investigational product in the six

         16. History of bleeding disorder (e.g. factor deficiency, coagulopathy or platelet
             disorder), or prior history of significant bleeding or bruising following IM
             injections or venipuncture

         17. Any other condition that, in the opinion of the principal investigator or his/her
             representative physician, could put the safety/rights of potential participants at
