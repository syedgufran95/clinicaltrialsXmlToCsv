  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among the distinctive features of Covid-19, numerous reports have stressed the importance of
      vascular damages associated with coagulopathy onset. Microparticles (MPs) shed by
      apoptotic/stimulated cells are reliable markers of vascular damage released upon
      pro-inflammatory conditions and behave as active participants in the early steps of clot
      formation. In addition, MPs carry ACE1 and ACE2, the cell-entry receptor for SARS-Cov2 in the
      vasculature and up-regulate ACE1 expression in neighbouring endothelial cells. This may
      contribute to unopposed angiotensin II accumulation which further exacerbate tissue injury
      and promote both inflammation and thrombosis. The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact
      of circulating MPs on ACE2 expression, the cell-entry receptor for SARS-Cov2 on endothelial
      cells.

      Circulating MPs will be isolated from Covid-19 patients with lupus anticoagulant, from
      coronary artery diseases patients and from healthy volunteers without cardiovascular risk
      factors. Quantification of MPs will be realized by prothrombinase assay. Primary endothelial
      cells (ECs) from porcine coronary artery or porcine pulmonary artery will be isolated and
      cultured. ECs will be exposed to circulating MPs. Phenotypical changes (ACE2 expression,
      cytoadhesins, cytokines, tissue factor expression) of ECs will be examined. Susceptibility of
      ECs to SARS-COV-2 infection will be determined.
