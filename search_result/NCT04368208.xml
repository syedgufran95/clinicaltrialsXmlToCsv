  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postnatal depression is an important problematic in French population with approximatively 10
      -20% of women who suffer from postnatal depression. This pathology may have strong negative
      impact on both women and neonate's health.

      The women's satisfaction degree in front of childbirth is an important factor associated with
      postnatal depression since women unsatisfied of their childbirth and/or women with a
      complicated childbirth are more encline to suffer from postnatal depression.

      It is likely that the actual context of Covid 19 pandemia and the change in obstetrical cares
      organization may have a negative impact on women's satisfaction about their childbirth and so
      a negative impact on the risk of postnatal depression.

        Women who deliver of a single baby, at term and in cephalic presentation whatever is the
        modalities of delivery (instrumental, cesarean, spontaneous delivery) will be included
        after their delivery.

        Premature and non cephalic birth will be excluded because they are specific deliveries that
        may be assoictaed with a specific maternal anxietey. Women with psychiatric disorders are
        excluded since we investigated the occurrence of postnatal depression which is a
        psychiatric disorder.

        Women without any internet access are excluded because women will have to fill online
        questionnaires. Finally women will be informed, as well as their doctors, in case of
        postnatal depression with an advice of planning a medical consultation.
