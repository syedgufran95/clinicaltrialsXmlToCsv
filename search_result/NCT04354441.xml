  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 was declared a pandemic on March 11th. Efforts to save lives are essential as we
      will face increasing morbidity with rising demands on health care resources. Since pregnant
      women with COVID-19 have systematically been excluded from drug trials, potential treatment
      options for these high-risk individuals remain untested. The aim of our trial is to determine
      whether hydroxychloroquine given to COVID-19 positive pregnant women can reduce
      COVID-19-related hospital admissions, thereby allowing women to stay at home while limiting
      utilization of hospital resources and resulting exposure of health care providers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to physiologic and immune changes, pregnant women are at high risk of severe
      complications and mortality from COVID-19 infections. Despite this, epidemiologic data on
      SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy is currently limited to small case-series describing a
      clinical course ranging from mild to critical illness requiring extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have demonstrated activity against
      SARS-coronaviruses in laboratory studies and are being tested in COVID-19 positive patients.
      HCQ appears more promising than chloroquine due to its greater effectiveness against
      SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and better safety profile. To date, pregnant women have been
      systematically excluded from trials conducted in the general outpatient population. Thus, we
      will carry out a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blinded trial of HCQ (considered safe
      in pregnancy in pregnant women with early COVID-19 infection across Canada to evaluate its
      effect in reducing COVID-19-related hospitalizations. This outpatient intervention is of
      paramount importance as its goal is to avoid overloading emergency rooms, obstetric triage,
      inpatient wards and critical care units. Upon completion of 6-month, our results can be
      directly applied to clinical care.

    <description>Measurement of reported symptoms using a validated questionnaire on Day 3, 7, 10, and every 2 weeks. The FLU-PRO Questionnaire instructs respondents to rate the severity of 37 influenza symptoms over the past 24 hours, including those related to the nose, throat, eye, chest, head, stomach, fatigue, and body aches/pains. For 32 of 37 items, respondents rated the severity of each symptom on 5-point Likert-type scales from 0 (&quot;Not at all), 1 (&quot;A little bit&quot;), 2 (&quot;Somewhat&quot;), 3 (&quot;Quite a bit&quot;), to 4 (&quot;Very much&quot;). For the five remaining items, severity is expressed as frequency of occurrence: vomiting or diarrhea (0 times, 1 time, 2 times, 3 times, or 4 or more times), and sneezing, coughing, and coughed up mucus or phlegm on a scale from 0 (&quot;Never&quot;) to 4 (&quot;Always&quot;), with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.</description>
