  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of a machine learning algorithm which
      identifies patients for whom hydroxychloroquine treatment is associated with predicted
      survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a multi-center pragmatic clinical trial, COVID-19 positive patients admitted to 6 United
      States medical centers were enrolled between March 10 and June 4, 2020. A machine learning
      algorithm was used to determine which patients were suitable for treatment with
      hydroxychloroquine.
