  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the four-week Healthy Minds Program
      (HMP) app Foundations training in employees of a mid-size urban school district in the United
      States during the summer of 2020, in the midst of the novel coronavirus pandemic. A 3-month
      follow-up in the fall of 2020 will also be conducted.

      Participants will be recruited via email and mailed postcards, and will first complete an
      online screen. Eligible participants will then enter a waiting zone for between 2-days and
      2-weeks before they are sent the online pre-test. Upon completion of the pre-test,
      participants will be assigned to condition via a simple random number generator. If assigned
      to the intervention (i.e., the Healthy Minds Program App), participants will receive
      instructions and support in downloading and activating the app. Every 7-days over the 4-week
      intervention period participants in both conditions will complete the same set of measures. A
      full battery of measures will be administered a second time post-test, following the 4-week
      intervention period. Three-months after post-test, a follow-up assessment will be conducted.

      The investigators predict that participants assigned to the intervention will demonstrate
      significantly reduced psychological distress after the intervention, and these decreases will
      persist at the 3-month follow-up. Further, it is hypothesized that baseline participant
      characteristics and early experience of the intervention will predict treatment adherence,
      study drop-out and outcomes, and that treatment engagement will moderate outcomes.

    <description>Healthy Minds Program (HMP) Description:
The HMP app was developed by Healthy Minds Innovations at the UW Center for Healthy Minds, and is based on the work of Richard Davidson, PhD. HMP is designed to promote and protect psychological well-being through sustainable skills training. The program is grounded in constituents of psychological well-being identified in empirical literature. HMP provides core content, with instruction administered through a curriculum of high-quality guided practices. HMP is based on research on eudaimonic well-being (e.g., environmental mastery, purpose) and brain-based skills that underlie these qualities (e.g., regulation of attention, mental flexibility). HMP has &gt;100 guided audio practices that address 4 constituents of well-being: awareness, connection, insight, and purpose.</description>

    <intervention_name>Healthy Minds Program Foundations Training</intervention_name>
    <description>The HMP is a novel, smartphone-based app that provides a series of guided meditation practices on four primary constituents of well-being: Awareness, Connection, Insight, and Purpose. The program is unique in several ways. First, all program elements are introduced with a summary of the scientific evidence supporting its constituent elements (e.g., Awareness and well-being). Second, in addition to standard sitting meditation practices found in many meditation-based behavioral interventions, the HMP offers active practices in which participants can develop the same skills but while embedding practice into activities they already do in their normal daily routine.</description>
