  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pneumonia caused by infection at SARS-CoV2 may be complicated by an acute respiratory detress
      syndrome need to take care in intensive care unit and can lead to mechanical ventilation.
      COVID-19 is a pandemic disease and lot of patients will survive of severe pneumoniae at
      SARS-CoV2 treat in ICU. At this time, there is no data about functional prognosis at long
      term.

      This aim of this study is to evaluate the recovery of quality of life, respiratory function,
      neuromuscular function at long term and incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder. Patients
      will follow during 1year after out of ICU with 3 consultations at 3month, 6month and 12month.
      At each consultation patients will be evaluated about respiratory function, effort tolerance
      via 6minutes walking test, psychologic function with IES-R and HAD score and quality of life
      with SF36.

      The hypothesis is that patients who survived of ARDS post infection at SARS-CoV2 have
      persistent functional limitation and alteration of quality of life one year after being
      discharged from the ICU.
