    <textblock>
      In our hospital's Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology service, patients who have
      been hospitalized due to Covid -19 infection have a musculoskeletal pain and headache during
      this process, and 466 patients will be recruited to compare them with the pre-disease state
      of the patients and to evaluate the pain status of the patients after treatment.

      This retrospectively designed study was carried out by analyzing SARS-CoV-2 infected and
      hospitalized patients in our hospital for 2 month. The patients, whose contact information
      can be accessed from the hospital records, will be called by phone and pain inquiries were
      made during the SARS-CoV-2 infection process. In addition, patients' demographic data, living
      conditions (number and characteristics of the person in the household), comorbidities,
      symptom inquiry related to infection, duration of symptoms, length of hospitalstay,
      pre-infection pain conditions and current pain, anxiety, depression levels and quality of
      life will be questioned.

      The pain questioning include the painful body region/s, severity (Numeric Rating Scale), type
      of analgesic drugs used, and duration of use that occurred during infection. Anxiety and
      depression levels will be evaluated, hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), and
      quality of life will be evaluated with SF-12 health assessment questionnaire.

    <time_frame>up to 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of patient's anxiety and depression level in hospital by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a 14-item self-report screening scale. It contains two 7-item scales: one for anxiety and one for depression both with a score range of 0-21. Higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>Evaluation of patient's quality of life by SF-12 Health assesment Questionaire. Two summary scores are reported from the SF-12 - a mental component score (MCS-12) and a physical component score (PCS-12). The scores may be reported as Z-scores (difference compared to the population average, measured in standard deviations). Higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>

    <description>A total of 466 patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of SARS-COV-2 at the University of Health Sciences, Şişli Hamidiye Etfal Training and Research Hospital were retrospectively screened. 212 of these patients did not answer the calls, 34 of them could not be reached because they gave the wrong phone number beforehand. 4 of the patients called by the phone had communication problems due to language problems and 10 people did not want to fill the questionnaire. 206 of them were contacted by the phone and their pain and myalgia in the head, neck-back, waist, shoulder and hip regions before, during and after SARS-COV-2, their anxiety and depression levels after SARS-COV-2, and their quality of life were questioned.</description>
