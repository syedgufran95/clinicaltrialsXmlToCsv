  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Novel Coronavirus (2019nCoV) or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)
      that causes Coronavirus Disease 2019, or known as Covid-19 has recently become a global
      health emergency since it was first detected in Wuhan, the People Republic of China in
      December 2019. Since then, the prevalence has rapidly increased worldwide. In Indonesia, by
      the end of April 2020, around 10,000 patients have been tested positive for Covid-19
      infection, with a case fatality rate of around 8%.

      The pathogenesis of Covid-19 is still under investigation and to our understanding, ACE2
      receptors in the alveoli serve as the binding site of the S-protein of envelope spike virus
      of SARS-CoV-2. TMPRSS2 enzyme aids the fusion between cell membrane and capsid of the virus,
      allowing penetration of virus into the cell. Vesicles containing virion fuse with cell
      membrane and released as new virions. Cytopathic effect of the virus and its ability to
      overcome immune response determines the degree of infection.

      Differences in immunological profile among degrees of severity of Covid-19 may vary
      especially for the number of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha
      (TNF-Î±), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, leukemia-inhibiting factors (LIF), immunological
      markers such as CXCR3+CD4+, CXCR3+CD8+ T cell and CXCR3+ NK cells, implying the ongoing
      cytokine storm. The previous studies also found increasing number for infection markers such
      as procalcitonin, ferritin, and C-reactive protein. The decreasing number of
      anti-inflammatory cytokines in such as IL-10 also supports this finding.

      Previous studies have shown immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory capacity of the
      mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs contributed to the shifting of pro-inflammatory Th2 into
      anti-inflammatory Th2. One of the most recent study on the usage of MSCs on Covid-19 patients
      showed increased expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), which give rise to
      inhibitory effect of T lymphocyte and natural killer (NK) cell population. Vascular
      epithelial growth factor (VEGF) is found increasing following MSCs administration, which
      indicates the ability to improve the disrupted capillaries due to SARS-Cov-2 infection. The
      ability of MSCs in differentiating to alveolar cells is proven by the presence of SPM and
      SPC2, surfactant proteins produced by type II alveolar cells. MSCs are unable to be infected
      by SARS-CoV-2 since they don't have ACE2 receptors and TMPRSS2 enzyme.

      This study is a double blind, randomized control trial (RCT). This study will be concluded in
      2 months, from May to July 2020, from subject selection to the end of follow up. Research
      subjects are obtained consecutively from Covid-19 patients who receive care in the intensive
      care unit (ICU) across four Covid-19 referral hospitals, including Persahabatan Hospital,
      Sulianti Saroso Center for Infectious Disease, Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital, and
      Universitas Indonesia Hospital, with 10 subjects obtained from each hospital and total 40
      subjects for this RCT. Subjects from each hospitals are divided into control and experimental
      groups. Subject belongs to the control group will receive standardized therapy (consisting of
      oseltamivir and azithromycin), whereas subjects in the experimental group will receive MSCs
      infusion, in addition to standardized therapy.

      Subject Criteria Inclusion Criteria for MSC Donor from Umbilical Cord:

      Umbilical cord is collected from elective caesarean section from a fullterm pregnancies
      without any complication and free from HIV, Hepatitis B, C, D virus, Cytomegalovirus, Rubella
      Virus, and free from fungal and bacterial contamination.

      Informed consent all of the subjects must be filled and signed up before ruled in this study.

      As soon as after delivery, the umbilical cord is collected and processed in sterile specimen
      0,9% NaCl at 4oC for 8 hours. The umbilical cord transported to the laboratory and cultured
      in GMP lab, at Stem Cells Medical Technology Integrated Service Unit Cipto Mangunkusumo
      Hospital. Cellular viability and proliferation are evaluated after cell characterization test
      by flow cytometer.

      Sterility tests are done three times to ensure cellular sterility. Subjects will receive MSCs
      through infusion through intravenous for 1 hour, following the administration of
      diphenhydramine and anticoagulant to prevent clotting.

      Following the MSCs administration, monitoring at the patients is carried out every day,
      whereas laboratory testing for basic parameters (complete blood count, differential count,
      blood gas analysis, C-reactive protein, SGOT/SGPT (AST/ALT), Ureum/Creatinine, eGFR,
      electrolyte, procalcitonin, albumin, total bilirubin, D-Dimer, fibrinogen, troponin I and
      proBNP) are carried out every three days. Cytokine levels are measured before the
      administration and 7th day after the administration. Chest radiography is carried out every
      three days.
