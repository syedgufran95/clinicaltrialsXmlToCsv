  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since end of December, a new coronavirus, close to the 2002 SARS coronavirus, cause serious
      pneumonias throughout world. There is currently no strong evidence of an efficient specific
      treatment. Hydroxychloroquine is an old chloroquine-derived drug, prescribed for auto-immune
      disorders. It has shown efficacy against Sars-CoV-2 in vitro. Some studies showed that
      Hydroxychloroquine might improve the clinical status of Sars-CoV-2 infected patients.
      Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic, with immunomodulatory properties. Adding Azithromycin
      to a hydroxychloroquine-based treatment showed an apparent accelerated viral clearance in
      infected patients. This study wants to evaluate the clinical impact of adding Azithromycin to
      Hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of Sars-CoV-2 pneumonia
