      The purpose of this study is to determine whether XPro1595 can prevent the progression of
      respiratory complications in COVID19 patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is a Phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of
      XPro1595 in participants with pulmonary complications due to COVID-19 infection.

      Patients with COVID-19 infection and a room air oxygen saturation (SaO2) &gt;94% and at least
      one high risk factor (see below) are eligible to participate in a 28-day study to determine
      whether XPro1595 can prevent the progression of pulmonary complications.

      Eligible participants will be randomized (1:1) to receive either XPro1595 + standard of care
      (SOC) or Placebo + SOC. Participants randomized to XPro1595 + SOC will receive a 1mg/kg
      injection of XPro1595 after randomization. Patients that remain in the hospital 7 days after
      the first dose will receive a second dose. A final safety visit will occur on Day 28.
