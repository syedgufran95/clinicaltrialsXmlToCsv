      This is a two-center, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study of anti-SARS-CoV-2 equine
      immunoglobulin fragments F(ab')2 (INOSARS) to evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy in the
      treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Clinical improvement at 28 days from the start

      This is a two-center, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study of anti-SARS-CoV-2 equine
      immunoglobulin fragments F(ab')2 (INOSARS) to evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy in the
      treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Subjects included in the study are hospitalized
      adult patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19, that: 1) require supplementary oxygen or
      non-invasive mechanical ventilation OR 2) have clinical or imaging evidence of pneumonia OR
      3) have laboratory markers of risk of disease progression (high levels of serum inflammatory
      markers). The sample size is 51 patients randomized to one of three arms: 18 patients to
      placebo, 16 patients to dose 1 and 17 patients to dose 2 of anti-SARS-CoV-2 equine
      immunoglobulin F(ab')2 fragments. The safety outcome is the proportion of patients with early
      and late adverse events until the end of follow-up at 28 days, for both doses of treatment.
      The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with clinical improvement at 28 days from
      the start of treatment, comparing between both treatment groups vs placebo. Clinical
      improvement is defined as a reduction of 1 point in the NIAID 8-point ordinal scale of
      clinical status for COVID-19 patients or hospital discharge, whichever comes first.

    <description>The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with clinical improvement at 28 days after treatment. Clinical improvement is defined as (whichever is first): a) hospital discharge or b) reduction of 1 point in the NIAID 8-point ordinal scale. Scale categories as follows: 1 = not hospitalized; 2 = not hospitalized with limitation of activities and/or oxygen requirement; 3 = hospitalized not requiring supplemental oxygen and not requiring active medical care, 4 = hospitalized requiring active medical care without requiring oxygen supplementation; 5 = hospitalized requiring oxygen supplementation; 6 = hospitalized requiring high-flow oxygen or non-invasive mechanical ventilation; 7 = hospitalized requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); 8 = death.</description>
