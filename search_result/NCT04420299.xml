  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 2019 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is a new disease caused by the SARS-CoV2 virus of
      which many things are not yet known. Among others, there is a need to define the best
      therapeutic strategy to treat Covid-19, improving patients survival and reducing
      complications in its management, for which many different types of treatments are being
      tested.

      The drug being tested in this clinical trial is called bemiparin. Bemiparin is a drug
      authorized as a prevention and as a treatment for deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in one or
      more veins, generally in the legs) and venous thromboembolism (when the clot can detach and
      lodge in other organs such as the lungs). Covid-19 patients have been shown to be at
      increased risk of developing clotting problems such as those described above.

      In this context, this clinical trial is being carried out to find out if certain doses of
      bemiparin can contribute to better management of the disease.
