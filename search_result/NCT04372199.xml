  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), first merged in China in December
      2019, is now becoming a Public Health Emergency, recently confirmed as a pandemic disease by
      the World Health Organization.

      In particular, since February 2020, a rapidly growing number of cases has been identified in
      Italy.

      The clinical picture of ranges from asymptomatic cases, mild upper respiratory tract
      infections to severe pneumonia with respiratory failure and death. In most severe cases,
      COVID-19 disease may be complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic
      shock and multiorgan failure.

      It results fundamental to early identify those subjects who rapidly may worsen their clinical
      status, often requiring an intensive care unit (ICU) admission.

      It has been showed that, mainly in more severe forms of SARS-Cov-2 disease, there is the
      development of an hyperinflammatory status resembling a cytokine storm syndrome, as already
      reported in SARS patients.

      A recent study by Haung et al. reported that patients with COVID-19 infection showed high
      amounts of IL1B, IFN-gamma, IP10 and MCP1, probably linked to activated T-helper1 (Th1) cell
      responses. Those requiring ICU admission had higher levels of cytokines than those subjects
      not requiring ICU admission, thus suggesting that cytokine storm was associated with disease
      severity.

      A similarity between cytokine profile of COVID-19 disease and secondary haemophagocytic
      syndrome (sHLH) has been reported. Therefore, it was suggested to screen all patients with
      severe COVID-19 infection both for hyperinflammatory markers (like ferritin), and the HScore
      commonly used to generate a probability for diagnosis of sHLH (8), which includes some
      laboratory parameters like triglycerides, fibrinogen, ferritin, serum aspartate
      aminostransferase.

      Based on our experience on patients affected by pneumonia from Covid19, we have observed that
      those subjects with a more severe prognosis might have some predictive markers. We intend to
      verify if these markers can identify those subjects with Covid19 infection who need a more
      intensive therapy and to find a prognosis score.
