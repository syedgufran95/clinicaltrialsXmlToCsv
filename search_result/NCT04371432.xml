      Background:

      The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic presents a serious challenge to public health. Some people
      who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 have mild symptoms or none at all. But others develop severe
      symptoms, like pneumonia or organ failure. Researchers think that people s genes might play a
      role in how sick they get. Researchers want to look at the genes of people who have tested
      positive for COVID-19 to learn more.

      Objective:

      To learn more about COVID-19 by studying the DNA of people who have tested positive for it,
      and to share data as fast as possible with other qualified researchers who are also trying to
      learn more about COVID-19.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 3 years and older who have tested positive for COVID-19 and are being treated at
      the NIH Clinical Center or have tested positive through the Occupational Medical Service

      Design:

      Participants will complete a questionnaire about their health history and COVID-19 symptoms.

      Participants will give a blood sample. It will be about 2 tablespoons of blood. Researchers
      will use this blood sample to study the participant s DNA.

      The data about participants genes will be stored in a large database. The database will be
      shared with other qualified researchers who are trying to learn about COVID-19. Participants
      names and other personal details will not be shared. Instead, the data will be labeled with a
      code.

      Participants may be contacted by study team members for up to a year after they give their
      blood sample.

    <textblock>
      The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic presents a serious challenge to public health. Individuals
      infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience extremes in symptomatology ranging from a complete lack
      of symptoms to rapidly worsening end-stage pulmonary disease. The explanatory mechanism
      underlying susceptibility to severe disease remains unknown. We hypothesize that underlying
      genetic factors are at least partially explanatory. We aim to employ a phenotypic extremes
      approach to rapidly ascertain severely and mildly affected COVID-19 patients for genomic
      interrogation to identify germline and somatic variants that may play a role in host
      susceptibility to disease to correlate those phenotypic extremes with genetic variants. We
      will employ both a rare and common variant approach, using both genome sequencing and SNP
      chip analysis and B and T cell repertoire interrogation.
