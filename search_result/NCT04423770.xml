  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As dentists begin reopening their practices during a global pandemic, the risk of COVID-19
      infection that dentists face in providing dental care remains unknown. Estimating the
      occupational risk of COVID-19, and producing evidence on the types of infection control
      practices and dental practices that may affect COVID-19 risk, is therefore imperative. The
      goal of the proposed study is to understand U.S.-based dentists' health and dental-practice
      reactions to COVID-19. To estimate this, U.S-based dentists will be surveyed monthly. These
      findings could be used to describe the prevalence and incidence of COVID-19 among dentists,
      determine what infection control steps dentists take over time, and estimate whether
      infection control adherence in dental practice is related to COVID-19 incidence.

        to infection rates. Would you also be willing to participate in a separate, longitudinal
        study that would require you to report whether you or your staff have exhibited symptoms of
        COVID-19, and whether you have been tested or diagnosed? The study would be anonymous and
