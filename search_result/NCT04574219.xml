  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our goal in this study is to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of virtual
      parental presence of parents on anxiety in children at induction of anesthesia at Cincinnati
      Children's Hospital, an institution whose use of parental presence on induction is deeply
      ingrained in our culture, and to determine the impact of coaching of parents either prior to
      arrival at the hospital vs. on the day of surgery on efficacy of virtual parental presence on
      induction. Our primary hypothesis is that virtual PPIA is both feasibile for the smooth
      induction of general anesthesia and is acceptable to parents, patients, and anesthesia
      providers at our isntutition. Our secondary hypothesis is that the coaching of parents prior
      to virtual PPIA enhances the effect of video parental presence at induction of anesthesia on
      children's anxiety and that coaching prior to arrival at the hospital will allow for
      increased ease and use of this technique.
