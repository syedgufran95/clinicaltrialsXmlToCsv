  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specimens collected will be used to evaluate matrix equivalency in an immunoassay in
      development for the detection of IgG or IgA or IgM antibodies to SARS - CoV2 in human serum.
      These reagents are for in vitro diagnostic use only.

      The objective of this study is to acquire paired serum, plasma and whole blood collected on a
      collection card from subjects with no known history of COVID-19 infection. The specimens will
      be collected at Biomerica in Irvine CA for specimen collection, banking, and matrix
      equivalency studies for projects in development at Biomerica for detection to IgG or IgA or
      IgM antibodies to Sars-CoV2 antibodies. Subject will also be asked to self-collect a nasal
      swab for COVID-19 PCR

    <description>This study is designed to collect specimens to support specimen matrix equivalency in an in vitro diagnostic assay for the detection of COVID-19 antibodies.
Additionally, specimens collected via finger stick will be used to validate a whole blood collection card that could be used in the field by trained professionals and sent back to central reference laboratories for testing.</description>
