  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that use of convalescent plasma donated from individuals recovered from
      Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) will help expedite recovery of individuals with active,
      severe COVID-19 infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if convalescent plasma is safe and effective for
      the treatment of patients acutely ill with COVID-19. The researchers want to confirm the
      right dose levels of immunoglobulins/antibodies (immune proteins) and find out what
      therapeutic effects plasma donated by recovered individuals like you has on people severely
      sick with COVID-19.
