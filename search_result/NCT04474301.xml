    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to gain an understanding of how experiences during the
      COVID-19 pandemic, regardless of COVID-19 status, may have impacted multiple domains of
      health-related quality of life and other areas such as COVID-19 specific psychological
      distress, and disruptions to health care, finances and social interactions. We will also
      evaluate the extent to which resiliency factors such as social support, perceived benefits
      under times of stress, and ability to manage stress may buffer associations between COVID-19
      experiences and HRQoL. To meet these objectives, we have developed a 10-minute questionnaire
      that taps into these areas and is based on prior work addressing concerns of other pandemics
      or national crises. Participants will have previously consented to protocol PA15-0336 and
      have provided prior lifestyle data. This will allow us to connect the COVID-19 survey data
      with prior existing data.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., exposure, risk factors, testing,
      isolation, seropositivity, hospitalization, loss of family or friends); COVID-19-specific
      psychological distress (e.g., fear, anxiety and depressive symptoms); health, financial and
      social disruptions; perceived benefits and social support; and health-related quality of life
      (HRQoL) in melanoma patients who participated in protocol PA15-0336.

      II. Evaluate the extent to which COVID-19 experiences are associated with COVID-19-specific
      psychological distress, health, financial and social disruptions, perceived benefits and
      social support, and HRQoL.

      III. Evaluate the extent to which resiliency factors such as social support and perceived
      benefits moderate the effects of COVID-19 experiences on COVID-19-specific psychological
      distress and HRQoL.

      IV. Explore the association between prior lifestyle data collected as part of PA15-0336 and
      COVID-19-specific psychological distress and HRQoL.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete a survey over 10 minutes.
