      Evaluation of novel coronavirus induced severe pneumonia by dental pulp mesenchymal stem
      cells
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Open, single center, single arm test design. Plan to enroll 24 subjects. On the basis of
      clinical standard treatment, the injection of dental mesenchymal stem cells was increased on
      day 1, 3 and 7 of the trial.

      Injection dose: 1.0x106 cells /kg. Injection method: slowly and quietly drop 50 mL of normal
      saline, then the endodontic mesenchymal stem cell injection (after 60 min), and then 50 mL of
      normal saline.
