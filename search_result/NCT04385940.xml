  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is a global dramatic pandemic that is
      immeasurably impacting the communities. Due to lack of data, symptomatic management is used
      for COVID-19 infection including oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation for those with
      severe infection. Considering immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory anti-fibrotic and
      anti-oxidant actions of vitamin D, it's safety and ease of administration, as well as direct
      effects of vitamin D on immune cell proliferation and activity, pulmonary ACE2 expression and
      reducing surface tension, evaluation of vitamin D supplementation as an adjuvant therapeutic
      intervention could be of substantial clinical and economic significance. High prevalence of
      vitamin D deficiency in elderly, smokers, patients with chronic diseases and excess uptake by
      adipose tissue in obesity make investigations of its role as a secondary therapeutic agent in
      COVID-19 conceivable. It should be necessary to monitor serum 25(OH)D levels in all inpatient
      and outpatient populations with COVID-19 to identify the importance of maintaining or
      promptly increasing circulating levels of 25(OH)D into the optimal range of 100-150 nmol/L.

      The aim of this study is to conduct a double blind, randomized, controlled three weeks
      clinical trial on the efficacy of vitamin D (daily low dose versus weekly high dose) in
      COVID-19 patients in order to determine the relationship between baseline vitamin D
      deficiency and clinical characteristics and to asses patients' response to vitamin D
      supplementation in week three and determine its association with disease progression and
      recovery.

      Subjects who are randomized to high-dose will be asked to take 50,000 IU for two times during
      the first week and one dose over second and third weeks to quickly raise their serum levels.
      Subjects in the low-dose arm will take vitamin D 1000 IU daily for three weeks.

      In-patients

        1. Determine the frequency of low serum Vit D levels (&lt;50 nmol/L) in COVID-19 patients.

        2. Determine the relationship between baseline vitamin D status and disease severity,
           laboratory biochemical tests of white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP),
           lymphocyte count, leukocytes counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio (NLR), lactate
           dehydrogenase, IL-6, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha platelet count, albumin, and serum ferritin,
           required hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admission.

        3. Asses patients' initial response to vitamin D supplementation in week one and determine
           its association with disease progression and recovery.

        4. Compare disease severity and progression, laboratory biochemical tests of white blood
           cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), lymphocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase,
           IL-6, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, platelet count, albumin, and serum ferritin, hospital
           admission and length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, hospital mortality and
           respiratory failure differ between the early responder and non-responder groups.

      Out-patients

        1. Determine the frequency of low serum Vit D levels (&lt;50 nmol/L) in COVID-19 patients.

        2. Determine the relationship between baseline vitamin D deficiency and clinical
           characteristics.

        3. Asses patients' response to vitamin D supplementation in week three and determine its
           association with disease progression and recovery
