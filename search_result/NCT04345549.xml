    <textblock>
      From the end of January 2020, Coronavirus disease 2019 began to spread in United Kingdom
      (UK). During the same time, seasonal flu continued to circulate across the UK. With similar
      course of management at early stages, flu like symptoms were self-isolated to prevent the
      spread and further complications of infection. Present study aimed to evaluate the effect of
      self-managed Ayurveda on flu like symptoms in people who self-isolated at home for 7-days in
      March 2020 during the Covid-19 outbreak in UK.
