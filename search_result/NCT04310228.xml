      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of favipiravir combined with
      tocilizumab in the treatment of corona virus disease 2019.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In clinical institutions that enroll patients with corona virus disease 2019, three arms,
      multi-center, randomized and controlled methods are adopted. Patients are divided into three
      groups, favipiravir combined with tocilizumab group, favipiravir group and tocilizumab group.
      150 patients are expected to be enrolled and the cases are allocated according to the ratio
      of 3( favipiravir combined with tocilizumab group): 1(favipiravir group): 1(tocilizumab
      group).
