  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rapidly spreading coronavirus Covid-19 pandemic is a major concern worldwide and Italy is
      at the forefront of this emergency. At the present moment, the effects on the offspring of
      Covid-19 disease in pregnant women and/or the indirect effect of COVID-19-related prenatal
      maternal stress are poorly understood. Epigenetic mechanisms - and especially DNA methylation
      - are involved in the embedding of prenatal exposures to large-scale disasters into the
      epigenome and phenotypic outcomes of the offspring. Specific target genes include SLC6A4,
      NR3C1, OXTR, BDNF, and FKBP5. The central hypothesis of this project is that the exposure to
      the COVID-19-related prenatal maternal stress may affect infants' outcomes from birth to 12
      months partially through increased methylation of target genes involved in stress regulation.
      The main goal is to investigate the association between Covid-19 disease in pregnancy or
      COVID-19-related PMS in women pregnant during the first 9 months of the year 2020 and the
      emotional, social, and cognitive developmental outcomes in their infants from birth to 12
      months. Additionally, the role of target genes methylation in mediating this association will
      be investigated. Mothers and their infants will be enrolled from the delivery units of eleven
      neonatal facilities located in Northern Italy's COVID-19 contagion hotspot. One group will be
      enrolled from April to October 2020 (COVID-Exposure Pregnancy, CEP), a second group will be
      enrolled from April to October 2021 (Non-Exposure Pregnancy, NEP). Moreover, the CEP group
      will include mothers positive or exposed to COVID-19-related MPS during different trimesters
      of pregnancy, allowing within-group comparisons on developmentally sensitive time windows.
      Within 48 hours from baby delivery, saliva samples will be obtained from CEP and NEP
      newborns, immediately stored at -20Â°C and analyzed for epigenetic analyses using
      Next-Generation Sequencing. At 3 and 6 months, mothers will be asked to fill-in validated and
      reliable questionnaires on the emotional and social-behavioral development of their infants.
      At 12 months, infants' stress regulation and maternal sensitivity will be evaluated through
      video recording of mother-infant interactions. This study will provide unprecedented relevant
      insights on the biochemical mechanisms underlying the impact of Covid-19 disease and the
      related PMS on human offspring's developmental outcomes.
