  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind phase 2 clinical
      study of the efficacy and safety of CERC-002, a potent inhibitor of LIGHT, for the treatment
      of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who have mild to moderate ARDS.

      LIGHT is a cytokine in the TNF super family (TNFSF14) which drives inflammation and induces
      many other cytokines including IL-1, IL-6 and GM-CSF. LIGHT levels have been shown to be
      elevated in COVID-19 infected patients and inhibiting LIGHT is hypothesized to ameliorate the
      cytokine storm which has shown to be a major factor in progression of ARDS.

      The study will assess the efficacy and safety of CERC-002 in patients with severe COVID-19
      over a 28 day period as single dose on top of standard of care.
