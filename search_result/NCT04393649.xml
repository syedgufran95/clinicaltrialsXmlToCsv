  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease. Physical distancing is one of
      the most effective ways to reduce the spread of COVID-19, but this key prevention
      intervention may have adverse consequences on older adults living at home. Screening older
      adults living at home and at risk for adverse consequences of physical and social distancing
      is, therefore, a priority in order to prevent their occurrence. ESOGER (&quot;Evaluation Social et
      GERiatrique&quot;) is a clinical tool designed to: 1) screen the risk-levels for adverse
      consequences related to COVID-19 physical distancing and 2) to continue appropriate
      preventive interventions in older adults living at home including frail older patients and
      older community dwellers. Experience cumulated during the past two weeks revealed that ESOGER
      could be improved, in order to be more effective and efficient for the prevention of adverse
      consequences related to COVID-19 physical distancing. This improvement is based on two key
      components: 1) Comments of Montreal ESOGER users and 2) Analysis of data. Because at this
      time no information is saved and stored, there is a need to save and store ESOGER information
      and create the ESOGER databank.
