  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will describe the recovery process of patients undergoing cardiac surgery during
      the covid-19 pandemic. This will focus on hemodynamic failure and organ dysfunction after
      surgery.

      Capturing real-world data and sharing international experience will inform the management of
      this complex group of patients who undergo surgery throughout the COVID-19 pandemic,
      improving their clinical care.

      This investigator-led, non-commercial, non-interventional does not collect any patient
      identifiable information.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Performing cardiac surgery in the context of SARS-CoV2 infection is potentially at risk of
      marked post-operative hemodynamic failure (shock) due to the inflammatory reaction generated
      by the surgery and the extracorporeal circulation associated with the viral infection. In
      addition, in the absence of infection, 30-50% of patients will experience acute
      post-operative respiratory failure due to the combined effects of extracorporeal circulation
      and general anesthesia. The pulmonary tropism of the virus therefore is susceptible to
      increase in post-operative respiratory impairment.

      Thus, the infection is likely to favor the occurrence of post-operative shock but also to
      aggravate respiratory failure and other post-operative organ failures.

      Therefore, the investigators designed an observational study that aims at comparing two
      groups of patients:

        -  Cardiac or thoracic surgery patients with a negative Covid-19 PCR pre-operatively and in
           the 5 following days

        -  Cardiac or thoracic surgery patients with a positive Covid-19 PCR in the 5 days before
           or after surgery

    <description>The VIS score correlates with mortality after cardiac surgery and reflects the degree of patient hemodynamic failure. This score is calculated as follows:
ISR = Dobutamine dose in g/kg/min + 100 times the Adrenaline dose in g/kg/min + 100 times the Noradrenaline dose in g/kg/min + 10,000 times the Vasopressin dose in U/kg/min.</description>
