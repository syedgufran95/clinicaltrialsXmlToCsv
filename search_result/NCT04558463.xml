  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to analyze the effectiveness and safety of Avigan® (favipiravir) compared to
      Oseltamivir as an adjuvant therapy among adult COVID-19 patients. This study will be
      conducted in a hospital setting, recruiting adult COVID-19 patients with mild, moderate, and
      severe symptoms. Subjects will be randomly given Favipiravir or Oseltamivir as an adjuvant
      therapy to standard COVID-19 treatment. Patients will be followed up for 21 days after the
      first dose of intervention given. The primary outcomes of this study are the improvement of
      radiology results and RT PCR negative conversion during follow up. The secondary outcomes are
      adverse events, hospital length of stay (LOS), and Case fatality rate (CFR)
