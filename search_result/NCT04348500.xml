  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, exploratory phase II
      study enrolling 60 patients. We propose the administration of a blinded dose of an
      investigational product (IP) (clazakizumab or placebo[0.9% saline]) in patients with COVID-19
      disease and signs of pulmonary involvement who have not yet required mechanical ventilation
      and/or ECMO. If a patient progresses to mechanical ventilation and/or ECMO or develops
      clinical signs of deteriorating COVID-19 disease, and there are no treatment related serious
      adverse events(SAEs), within the initial 14 day period after the first dose of the IP, at the
      discretion of the investigator or treating physician, open-label clazakizumab 25mg IV X 1
      dose may be administered. A minimum of 24 hours should elapse between the first dose of IP
      and this dose of open-label clazakizumab. The patient will remain blinded as to the identity
      of the IP administered in the first dose.

      Patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 disease with signs of pulmonary involvement will
      be randomized to receive the anti- IL-6 drug clazakizumab 25mg IV or placebo. Patients will
      be followed for improvements in clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters which are part of
      our COVID-19 lab panel described below. Patients will receive SOC supportive treatment and
      will be followed for 14 days. If a patient from either group progresses to the need for
      mechanical ventilation and/or ECMO, or develops clinical signs of deteriorating COVID-19
      disease, and there are no serious treatment related SAEs, at the discretion of the
      investigator or treating physician, the patient may receive a single dose of open-label
      clazakizumab 25mg IV. A minimum of 24 hours should elapse between the first dose of IP and
      this dose of open-label clazakizumab.

      Enrolled patients will receive clazakizumab 25 mg or placebo (0.9% saline) given by IV
      infusion over 30 minutes. Clazakizumab will be administered in 50 mL of 0.9% saline on Day 1.

      COVID-19 lab panel and clinical parameters will be monitored to determine if patients are
      progressing towards need for ventilation and/or ECMO. The parameters below will be monitored
      and patient status will be assessed by the clinical team.

      If patients do develop these criteria, open-label clazakizumab 25 mg IV may be administered
      as discussed above. A minimum of 24 hours should elapse between the first dose of IP and this
      dose of open-label clazakizumab. Patients ventilated with or without ECMO will continue to be
      monitored post-treatment for signs of improvement, (i.e., decreasing FiO2 requirements, CXR
      improvements, CRP reductions, extubation and discharge home) or death.
