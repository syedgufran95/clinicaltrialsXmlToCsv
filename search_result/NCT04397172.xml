  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 patients with a severely symptomatic progression with development of an Acute
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to SARS-CoV-2 need prolonged intensive care
      treatment involving pharmacological immobilization, sedation and mechanical ventilation,
      leaving them at a very high risk for developing Critical illness myopathy (CIM). CIM is
      associated with increased mortality and significant consequences for recovery and the ability
      to return to normal daily life. Up to date, there are no studies investigating the mid- or
      long-term course of the novel COVID-19 disease. The present study therefore aims to evaluate
      the clinical outcome of patients with ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2 with special attention to the
      development of CIM and its underlying causes. To provide the possibility of early diagnosis
      of CIM, critically ill patients will be regularly screened for muscle membrane alterations
      using (Muscle velocity recovery cycles) MRVC measurements.

      The primary endpoint is the incidence of CIM in patients with ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2,
      diagnosed according to the current diagnostic criteria.

      COVID-19 patients with a severely symptomatic progression with development of an ARDS due to
      SARS-CoV-2 need prolonged intensive care treatment involving pharmacological immobilization,
      sedation and mechanical ventilation, leaving them at a very high risk for developing CIM. CIM
      is associated with increased mortality and significant consequences for recovery and the
      ability to return to normal daily life. Up to date, there are no studies investigating the
      mid- or long-term course of the novel COVID-19 disease. The present study therefore aims to
      evaluate the clinical outcome of patients with ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2 with special attention
      to the development of CIM and its underlying causes. To provide the possibility of early
      diagnosis of CIM, critically ill patients will be regularly screened for muscle membrane
      alterations using MRVC measurements.

      Objective:

      The primary objective of this project is to prospectively evaluate the incidence and severity
      of CIM in patients with ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2.

      The secondary objectives of this project include:

        1. To assess the quality of life of patients with and without CIM after ARDS due to
           SARS-CoV-2.

        2. To monitor changes in muscle excitability parameters in critically ill patients with
           ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2 in relation to a later confirmed diagnosis of CIM according to
           the current standards.

        3. To explore underlying pathophysiological processes for CIM (mitochondrial dysfunction,
           medication e.g. Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA), sedative drugs, and metabolic
           (amino acids, inflammatory parameters)).

      Method:

      After enrolment in the study, patients will be examined for the first time within 24 hours
      after admission to the ICU, and follow-up visits will be performed at day 2, 5 and 10 or upon
      termination of therapy with NMBA, respectively. The endpoint will be at the clinical
      follow-up appointment.

        The present study aims to prospectively evaluate the incidence and severity of CIM in
        patients with ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2.

        The investigators therefore conduct a study including patients with ARDS admitted to the
        intensive care unit (ICU) due to the novel COVID-19 disease (SARS-CoV-2). The investigators
        plan to analyze 50 full data sets of ICU patients (regarding primary endpoint), out of
        which about 30-50% will be expected to develop CIM. There is no alternative group of
        patients with whom this study could be conducted.
