  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The impact of the current Covid-19 pandemic on healthcare workers is enormous. This
      longitudinal study investigates the prevalence of mental health problems and the quality of
      life of healthcare workers during and after the Covid-19 pandemic. Underlying risk factors
      are also examined. Health care workers of the different Covid-19 cohort and transit wards, as
      well as the intensive care unit and (psychiatric) emergency services of the Ghent university
      hospital will be included, as well as the health care workers of 6 non-Covid-19 wards.

      The impact of the current Covid-19 pandemic on healthcare workers is enormous. Previous
      studies during the SARS outbreak demonstrated a significant burden and increase of mental
      health problems in health care workers.This longitudinal study aims to investigate the
      prevalence of mental health problems and the quality of life of health care workers during
      and after the Covid-19 pandemic. Health care workers of the different Covid-19 cohort and
      transit wards, as well as the intensive care unit and (psychiatric) emergency services of the
      Ghent university hospital will be included, as well as the health care workers of 6
      non-Covid-19 wards. Participants will receive a monthly online survey during the government
      issued restrictions. After cessation of the restrictions participants will receive
      three-monthly surveys for a one-year-period.

      Sociodemographic data, data regarding employment and previous mental health problems will be
      collected at the first survey. The Covid-19 status of the health care workers will be
      inquired at every survey. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), the Dutch
      translation of the Covid-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI), the WHO Quality of Life-BREF
      (WHOQOL-BREF), and the Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5 (PC-PTSD-5) and three items
      measuring social support will be administered at every survey.

The score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more distress.</description>

    <measure>Post traumatic stress symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5 (PC-PTSD-5) is a 5-item screen that was designed for use in primary care settings. The measure begins with an item designed to assess whether the respondent has had any exposure to traumatic events. If a respondent denies exposure, the PC-PTSD-5 is complete with a score of 0. However, if a respondent indicates that they have experienced a traumatic event over the course of their life, the respondent is instructed to respond to five additional yes/no questions about how that trauma exposure has affected them over the past month. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 5 with higher scores indicating more PTSD-related symptoms.</description>
