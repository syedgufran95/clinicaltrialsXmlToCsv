    <textblock>
      Several interactions by pre-existing therapies for chronic diseases, therapies used by
      SARS-CoV2 infection generate doubts about risks and benefits. Among these situations in which
      the current data indicate a situation of equipoise would be about the maintenance or
      suspension of ACEI / BRA in patients with SARS-CoV2 infection. Increasing the expression of
      ECA-2 could increase the binding to the virus, however, there are studies that indicate this
      increase in ECA-2 could be protective. So far, there is no clinical evidence to confirm any
      of the theories, and this question can only be clarified through a randomized clinical trial.

      The objective is to evaluate the impact of the suspension of the use of
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (BRA) on the
      length of hospital stay and on the mortality of patients with SARS-CoV2 infection.

    <description>The primary outcome of the study will be days alive and outside the hospital (DAOH) at 30 days. This endpoint will be calculated for each included patient and the calculation will be from the date of randomization to the 30-day post-randomization. The DAOH endpoint represents the follow-up time (30 days) subtracted from the hospitalization days and/or the days between death and the end of follow-up.</description>
