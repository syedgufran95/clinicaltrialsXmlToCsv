  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicentre prospective study will enroll a sufficient number of patients to afford
      approximately 60 positives and &gt; 40 negatives (as determined by the SOC - Comparator method)
      in the United States and/or Canada. One to three sites in the United States and/or Canada
      will participate over an approximate 12-week enrolment period. The actual enrolment period
      will be dependent upon prevalence of Covid-19. Once positives sample size is achieved,
      expected SARC-CoV-2 negative subjects will be permitted.

      This study is observational and will not impact the medical management of the patient. The
      results of the Spartan Test will be blinded to the clinical staff during the study and will
      not impact the medical management of the subject.

      Once informed consent is obtained and eligibility is confirmed, subject demographics, and
      patient reported COVID-19 symptoms will be recorded. For the purposes of this study,
      enrolment will be defined as the collection of the two study-specific nasopharyngeal (NP)
      samples for Spartan's Test. Each patient's active involvement in the study will last for
      approximately 30 minutes.

      To support the EUA, a minimum of 30 individual natural positive clinical specimens will be
      collected from patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection by a healthcare provider in
      COVID-19 disease endemic regions in the United States. Additionally, a minimum of 30
      individual negative samples will also be used to support the EUA from patients in the United
      States.

      Once subjects are consented and recruited for the study, three nasopharyngeal samples for
      each patient will be collected by trained operators at the clinical site. The first sample
      will be tested at the clinical site according to standard of care protocols currently in
      place for the sites' nasopharyngeal swab-based SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing. The second
      nasopharyngeal sample will be tested at the site using the Spartan COVID-19 v2 System. The
      third nasopharyngeal sample will be tested using the Spartan COVID-19 v2 System only when the
      test conducted with the second nasopharyngeal swab does not produce a positive or negative
      result.

      The sample for the SOC test will be collected prior to the samples for the Spartan COVID-19
      v2 System as per clinical regulations.
