        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed informed consent, demonstrating that the subject understands the procedures
             required for the study and the purpose of the study

          2. Healthy male or female subjects 18 years of age to 75 years of age

          3. Diabetic and obese (BMI &gt; 30) patients will be included in the Trial but randomization
             will be stratified.

          4. Positive test for COVID-19 by RT-PCR at screening

          5. Subjects must agree to practice at least two highly effective methods of birth control
             for the duration of the study. One of these must be a barrier method. Exceptions for
             females and partners of females that are not of childbearing potential. (e.g.
             surgically sterilized, post-menopausal)

          6. Subjects must agree they will attend the treatment facility daily for 10d in the event
             of failure to attend, the patient will be visited at their home to collect the nasal
             swab and review data.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Refusal to sign informed consent form

          2. Negative test for COVID-19 by RT-PCR at screening

          3. Severe disease symptomatically including pneumonia, respiratory distress, tachypnoea,
             shortness of breath, temperature &gt; 38 degrees C (100.4 degrees F), pleuritic pain, or
             frequent cough.

          4. Known drug allergy to any of the investigational medications

          5. Currently taking medication with known drug interactions with investigational
             medications, found in Appendix II

          6. Prescription or other antiviral medications

          7. Any comorbidities which constitute health risk for the subject including known cardiac
             arrhythmias - but will be limited to those on hydroxychloroquine

          8. Inability to attend daily for 10 days
