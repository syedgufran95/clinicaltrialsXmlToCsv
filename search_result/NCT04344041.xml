  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D is a secosteroid hormone produced by the skin during Summer exposure to UVB rays.
      Hypovitaminosis D is common in Winter (October to March) at Northern latitudes above 20
      degrees North, and from April to September at Southern latitudes beyond 20 degrees below the
      equator.

      In the past, coronaviruses and influenza viruses have exhibited very high seasonality, with
      outbreaks occurring preferentially during the Winter. The Covid-19 pandemic is indeed more
      severe above Winter latitudes of 20 degrees, while it remains until now less severe in the
      Southern hemisphere, with a much lower number of deaths.

      Preclinical research suggests that the SARS-Cov-2 virus enters cells via the angiotensin
      converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Coronavirus viral replication downregulates ACE2, thereby
      dysregulating the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and leading to a cytokine storm in the host,
      causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

      Research also shows that vitamin D plays a role in balancing RAS and in reducing lung damage.
      On the contrary, chronic hypovitaminosis D induces pulmonary fibrosis through activation of
      RAS. Similarly, hypovitaminosis D has been strongly associated in the literature with ARDS,
      as well as with a pejorative vital prognosis in resuscitation but also in geriatric units,
      and with various comorbidities associated to deaths during SARS-Cov-2 infections. Conversely,
      vitamin D supplementation has been reported to increase immunity and to reduce inflammatory
      responses and the risk of acute respiratory tract infections.

      High-dose oral vitamin D3 supplementation has been shown to decrease short-term mortality in
      resuscitation patients with severe hypovitaminosis D (17% absolute risk reduction). It is
      considered safe to take oral vitamin D supplementation at doses up to 10,000 IU/day for short
      periods, particularly in older adults, i.e. a population that is mostly affected by
      hypovitaminosis D and who should receive at least 1,500 IU of vitamin D daily to ensure
      satisfactory vitamin D status.

      Vitamin D supplementation is mentioned as a potentially interesting treatment for SARS-Cov-2
      infection but on a scientific basis with a low level of evidence until now.

      We hypothesize that high-dose vitamin D supplementation improves the prognosis of older
      patients diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to a standard dose of vitamin D.

      • Inclusion visit A clinical examination is carried out. Social-demographic measures, health
      history, clinical examination measures (including OSCI score) and biological measures are
      collected.

      Randomization is conducted on the day of the inclusion visit. The ZYMAD® 400,000 IU (2 vials
      of 200,000 IU) or 50,000 IU (1 vial of 50,000 IU) treatment is given to the patient.

        -  Visit at day 7 A blood test is carried out by a nurse to determine the serum 25-OHD,
           creatrinine, albumine and calcium concentrations.

        -  Visit at day 14 A visit or telephone call allows recording the onset of clinical events
           of interest. The drugs received as part of the usual treatment during the last 14 days
           are collected.

        -  Visit at day 28 A visit or telephone call allows recording the onset of clinical events
           of interest. The drugs received as part of the usual treatment during the last 14 days
           are collected.
