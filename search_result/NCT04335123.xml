    <textblock>
      This is an open label, phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety of losartan in
      respiratory failure due to COVID-19.

      Briefly, 50 patients with COVID-19 and respiratory failure who meet eligibility criteria and
      agree to participation in the study will be placed on losartan 25 mg daily on study day 0. If
      parameters are met the dose of losartan will be increased to 50 mg once daily on study day 3.
      Participants will continue losartan until they experience resolution of respiratory failure
      (normal oxygen levels on room air), are discharged from the hospital, meet stoppage criteria
      (detailed below) or complete 14 days of therapy.

      Patients and/or surrogate decision maker who do not give consent to treatment will be asked
      to allow collection of data from their medical record for use as a control group. We will
      also collect medical information relating to safety criteria on historical controls treated
      at the University of Kansas Hospital in the 30 days prior to the study start date (3/25/2020)
      and during the study period.

    <textblock>
      This is an open label, phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety of losartan in
      respiratory failure due to COVID-19.

      Clinical Trial setup:

      Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed below. Briefly, 50 patients with
      COVID-19 and respiratory failure who meet criteria and agree to participation in the study
      will be placed on losartan 25 mg daily on study day 0. If parameters are met the dose of
      losartan will be increased to 50 mg once daily on study day 3. Participants will continue
      losartan until they experience resolution of respiratory failure (normal oxygen levels on
      room air), are discharged from the hospital, meet stoppage criteria (detailed below) or
      complete 14 days of therapy.

      Patients and/or surrogate decision maker who do not give consent to treatment will be asked
      to allow collection of data from their medical record for use as a control group.

      Stoppage criteria for losartan

        -  Hyperkalemia (persistent values &gt;5.5 mM recorded on at least 2 readings).

        -  Worsening renal function (Cockcroft-Gault &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m2) or urinary output &lt;20
           mL/h.

        -  Skin rashes, palpitations or other moderate or severe adverse events (interference with
           usual daily activities) without clear explanation should warrant immediate cessation of
           treatment and notification of study personnel.

        -  Development of sustained hypotension defined as SBP &lt;90 mmHg, DBP &lt;60 mmHg recorded on
           at least two readings 30 min apart or use of norepinephrine &gt;0.1 µg/kg/min.

        -  Any change in monitor lab parameters deemed significant and potentially related to study
           drug by the Investigator.

    <description>Safety will be reported based on Protocol defined AEs.
For the purpose of this protocol, an AE will be defined as as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the study listed under DMSB - Anticipated Adverse Events and Grading Scale section of this protocol as well as safety monitoring data listed on protocol table 1 as well as stoppage criteria for losartan.
The event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. AEs will be collected for both study groups, treatment and control from the time the ICF is signed until the subject completes study participation.</description>
