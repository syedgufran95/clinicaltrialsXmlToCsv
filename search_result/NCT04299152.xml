  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the growing epidemic of a new coronavirus infectious disease (Covid-19) is
      wreaking havoc worldwide, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is a RNA virus that display high similarity in both
      genomic and proteomic profiling with SARS-CoV that first emerged in humans in 2003 in China.
      Therefore, preventing and controlling the pandemic occurrences are extremely urgent as a
      global top priority. Due to the lack of effective antiviral drugs, patients may be treated by
      only addressing their symptoms such as reducing fever. Clinical autopsies from
      SARS-CoV-infected patients demonstrated that there were major pathological changes in the
      lungs, immune organs, and small systemic blood vessels with vasculitis. However, the
      detection of SARS-CoV were primarily found in the lung and trachea/bronchus, but was
      undetectable in spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow, heart and aorta, highlighting the
      overreaction of immune responses induced by viral infection were really harmful, resulting in
      the pathogenesis of lungs, immune organs, and small systemic blood vessels. To this respect,
      immune modulation strategy may be potentially beneficial to enhance anti-viral immunity and
      efficiently reduce the viral load, improve clinical outcomes, expedite the patient recovery,
      and decline the rate of mortality in patients after being infected with SARS-CoV-2. Tianhe
      Stem Cell Biotechnologies Inc. has developed a novel globally-patented Stem Cell Educator
      (SCE) technology designed to reverse the autoimmune response in Type 1 diabetes (T1D),
      Alopecia Areata (AA) and other autoimmune diseases. SCE therapy uses human multipotent cord
      blood stem cells (CB-SC) from human cord blood. Their properties distinguish CB-SC from other
      known stem cell types, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and hematopoietic stem cells
      (HSC). Several clinical studies show that SCE therapy functions via CB-SC induction of immune
      tolerance in autoimmune T cells and restore immune balance and homeostasis in patients with
      T1D, AA and other inflammation-associated diseases. To correct the overreaction of
      overreaction of immune responses, the investigators plan to treat SARS-CoV-2 patients with
      Stem Cell Educator therapy.

      This is a prospective, two-arm, partially masked, single center clinical study to assess the
      safety, feasibility, and efficacy of SCE therapy for the treatment of patients with
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients will be evaluated by the study principal investigator or
      co-investigators. Informed consent will be obtained at the initial screening visit. Subjects
      who meet all criteria will be scheduled for treatment. All enrolled subjects will receive one
      treatment with the SCE therapy consisting of a single session of mononuclear cells (MNC)
      collection by apheresis of blood. The MNC product will be treated with the SCE, and followed
      by an infusion intravenously back to the patient. The SCE-treated subjects will be evaluated
      according to the schedules of follow-up studies within 4 weeks.
