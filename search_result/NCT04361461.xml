  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) has been identified in Wuhan,
      China, which causes severe pulmonary complications and flu syndrome, which has spread rapidly
      to all continents. Approximately 25% of hospitalized patients require treatment in intensive
      care units and 10% require mechanical ventilation. The diagnosis is made by the molecular
      polymerase chain reaction test. However, diagnostic tests are limited. The clinical care of
      the patient with COVID-19 is similar to that of patients with severe infectious respiratory
      complications, consisting of support and oxygen supplementation. Several medications have
      been tested as remdesivir, a pro-drug nucleoside, which acts by inhibiting viral RNA
      transcription, although a recently published study has shown no benefit. China recently
      approved the use of favipiravir, an antiviral used for influenza, as an experimental therapy
      for COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine is a drug with great potential treatment, as it can inhibit
      the pH-dependent steps of replication of various viruses, with a potent effect on SARS-CoV
      infection and spread. In this way, the present study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      the hydroxychloroquine in patients with symptomatic SARS-Cov2.

    <description>The ordinal scale is an assessment of the clinical status at the first clinical evaluation in a clinical study. The scale is as follows: 1) Death; 2) Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); 3) Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 4) Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 5) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care (COVID-19 related or otherwise); 6) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer requires ongoing medical care; 7) Not hospitalized, limitation on activities and/or requiring home oxygen; 8) Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities.</description>
