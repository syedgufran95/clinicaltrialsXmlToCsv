    <textblock>
      A randomized, open-label, multicenter, three-arm clinical trial to study the efficacy and
      safety of passive immunotherapy (convalescent plasma and anti-COVID-19 human immunoglobulin)
      compared to the standard treatment in Colombia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population will be patients (≥18 years) hospitalized by COVID-19 but still with an
      early form of the disease (in states 1-3 of the ordinal scale) who do not require mechanical
      ventilation (invasive or non-invasive) and who can give their consent informed.

      All the participants will receive non-specific supportive treatment for COVID-19 such as
      oxygen, IV liquid or corticosteroids. Additionally, they will be randomized to one of the
      following arms:

      Experimental arm 1: Plasma with inactivation/reduction of pathogens from convalescent
      patients with COVID-19 and who at the same time receive support therapy, in the 200 - 250 mL
      scheme, on days 1 and 3 of the intervention.

      Experimental arm: Anti-COVID-19 human immunoglobulin produced by Lifefactors Zona Franca
      S.A.S, intravenous at a dose of immunoglobulin 10% IgG solution (10% mL vial) for:

      Patient of 50 Kg or more, a dose of 50 mL will be applied on days 1 and 3 of treatment.

      Patients of less than 50 Kg, the dose will be 1 mL / Kg, will be applied on days 1 and 3 of
      treatment.

      This arm will be included once available. The supply of anti-COVID-19 human immunoglobulin
      produced by LifeFactors will be carried out once the national regulatory agency (Invima)
      grants authorization and/or the regulatory requirements for the production of medications are
      met.

      Control arm: Standard (specific) therapy for COVID-19 according to the suggested
      pharmacological recommendations of the Colombian Association of Infectious Diseases - ACIN.
      This therapy is subject to changes that are determined by the Colombian Health Regulatory
      Authorities.
