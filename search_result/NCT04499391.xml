  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nursing homes are ground zero for the COVID-19 pandemic.Pennsylvania (PA) nursing homes are
      particularly devastated with 13,485 cases of COVID-19 and more than 2,800 deaths, accounting
      for 65% of the state's coronavirus deaths. Nursing homes are ill-equipped for the pandemic;
      though facilities are required to have infection control staff, only 3% have taken a basic
      infection control course.Significant research has focused on infection control in the acute
      care setting.However,little is known about the implementation of practices and effective
      interventions in long-term care facilities.The investigators propose an intervention
      utilizing Project ECHO, an evidence-based telehealth model, to connect Penn State University
      experts with remote nursing home staff and administrators to proactively support
      evidence-based infection control guideline implementation. Our study seeks to answer the
      critical research question of how evidence-based infection control guidelines can be
      implemented effectively in nursing homes

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit 100 nursing homes with approximately 12,600 residents from
      across PA's 695 nursing homes through collaborations with our state stakeholders. Nursing
      homes will be randomized to one of two arms: COVID-19 Project ECHO (25 hours of training over
      6 months), or the CDC infection control training (17 hours of training over 6 months).
      COVID-19 Project ECHO participants will include infection control staff and other facility
      leadership (e.g. medical director, director of nursing, administrators). Randomization will
      be stratified by characteristics of nursing homes to ensure balance among the two trial
      groups, including size (number of beds), type (independent vs. network facility), geographic
      location, and current COVID-19 infection rate. Patient-centered outcomes (nursing home
      residents with COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, deaths, and QOL) will be assessed at
      baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. All nursing homes can opt to receive the ECHO intervention in
      the last 6 months of the study. Our study is guided by the RE-AIM framework to critically
      evaluate both effectiveness and implementation outcomes of the proposed intervention. The
      RE-AIM framework is frequently utilized to improve sustainable adoption and implementation of
      effective, generalizable, evidence-based interventions like Project ECHO.

    <description>Nursing homes in this arm will receive the intervention via real-time, interactive videoconferencing using Zoom at no cost to participants. Sessions will be 60 minutes in duration and held weekly for 6 months (25 sessions total) at regularly scheduled times.
