  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 clinical trial to verify the safety and efficacy of DW-MSC in COVID-19
      patients. A total of 9 subjects are randomly allocated. Subjects who meet the final inclusion
      and exclusion criteria are randomized to the test groups (low-dose group and high-dose group)
      or control group (placebo group) in a ratio of 1:1:1. Subjects assigned to the test groups
      were administered intravenously once with 5 x 10^7cells of DW-MSC for the low-dose group or 1
      x 10^8cells for the high-dose group after registration. Subjects assigned to the control
      group were administered with placebo in the same manner as the test drug (DW-MSC). At this
      time, all of the existing standard co-treatment are allowed. DW-MSC is adjunct therapy to
      standard therapy.

      This clinical trial is a double-blind trial, in which a randomized method will be used. To
      maintain the double-blindness of the study, statistician who do not participate in this study
      independently generate randomization code. Subjects will be randomized to the test groups
      (low-dose group and high-dose group) or the control group (placebo group) in a 1:1:1 ratio.
      After the completion of the trial, the randomization code will be disclosed after unlocking
      the database and unblinding procedures. Follow Up period: observed for 28 days after a single
      administration

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Covid-19 have a mortality rate of about 35 ~ 50% and currently, severe patients
      caused by the Coronavirus show respiratory distress. To date, the incidence rate has been
      more than 3 million each year; however, as the increase and globalization of the
      environmental pollution has been expanded, the number of patients is expected to increase due
      to acute diseases such as the Middle East Respiratory virus, SARS, and coronavirus.

      Since 2015, Daewoong Pharmaceutical intends to use stem cells for product research on rare
      and intractable diseases including respiratory distress. Stem cells are also called
      pluripotent cells or truncal cells that can convert to any organ. It is an embryonic stage
      undifferentiated cell that has stopped differentiating before forming a specific organ whose
      differentiation has not been determined and has the ability to differentiate into muscle,
      bone, and internal conformal body organs. There are three types of stem cells: embryonic stem
      cells, adult stem cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells. Daewoong Pharmaceutical intends
      to develop cell therapy products using mesenchymal stem cells (MSC).
