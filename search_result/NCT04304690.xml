  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The epidemic due to the Sars-CoV2 virus is spreading in France, without knowning precisely
      since when the virus has actually circulated on the territory. Data from China but also
      systematic samples taken from the passengers of the Diamond Princess boat also report almost
      50% of asymptomatic forms of Covid-19. The medical and paramedical staff of the front-line
      services for the care of patients infected with Covid-19 are in fact potentially exposed to
      the risk of occupational contamination due to the large number of patients treated, including
      in the pre-epidemic phase. Therefore, and despite the application of standard protective
      measures, it is possible that a certain number of these personnel already have or will
      contract Covid-19 disease, including in its asymptomatic form.

      The epidemic due to Sars-CoV2 is spreading in France, without it being knowning precisely
      since when the virus actually circulated on the territory. Data from China but also
      systematic samples taken from the passengers of the boat Diamond Princess also report almost
      50% of asymptomatic forms of Covid-19. Medical and paramedical staff are in fact potentially
      exposed to the risk of professional contamination, with probably a different risk between the
      first-line referent hospitals and the others, due to the large number of patients treated in
      the first, including in the pre-epidemic phase (average of 190 consultants per day at the
      emergency department Pitié-Salpêtrière for example). Therefore, and despite the application
      of standard protective measures, it is possible that a certain number of these personnel
      already have or will contract Covid-19 disease, including in its asymptomatic form. Knowledge
      of this seroconversion rate, if it is found to be higher than that of the general population,
      could lead to a review of the measures to protect personnel from other emerging infectious
      risks.
