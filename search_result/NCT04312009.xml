    <measure>Difference in Estimated (PEEP adjusted) P/F Ratio at 7 days</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome calculated from the partial pressure of oxygen or peripheral saturation of oxygen by pulse oximetry divided by the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2 or SaO2 : FiO2 ratio). PaO2 is preferentially used if available. A correction is applied for endotracheal intubation and/or positive end-expiratory pressure. Patients discharged prior to day 7 will have a home pulse oximeter send home for measurement of the day 7 value, and will be adjusted for home O2 use, if applicable. Patients who died will be applied a penalty with a P/F ratio of 0.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>The SOFA assessment is used to track a person's risk status during stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The score is based on six different scores, one each for the respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal, and neurological systems. Each organ system is assigned a point value from 0 (normal) to 4 (high degree of dysfunction/failure). Total score is calculated by entering patient data into a SOFA calculator, a widely-available software. Total scores range from 0-24, with higher scores indicating greater chance of mortality.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oxygen Saturation / Fractional Inhaled Oxygen (F/S)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Oxygen saturation (percent) is measured by pulse oximeter. Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) (unitless) is the volumetric fraction of oxygen to other gases in respiratory support. The F/S ratio is unitless.</description>

    <measure>Change in PROMIS Dyspnea Functional Limitations</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Dyspnea (shortness of breath) item banks and pools assess self-reported Functional Limitations, Severity, Activity Motivation, Activity Requirements, Airborne Exposure, Assistant Devices Resources, Characteristics, Emotional Response, Task Avoidance and Time Extension as they related to dyspnea.
In the 33-item Functional Limitations bank, 33 daily activities are rated in terms of degree of difficulty while engaging in the activity over the past 7 days (0 = no difficulty, 1 = a little difficulty, 2 = some difficulty, 3 = much difficulty). Total scores range from 0 to 99, with higher scores reflecting greater functional limitations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <description>The PROMIS Dyspnea (shortness of breath) item banks and pools assess self-reported Functional Limitations, Severity, Activity Motivation, Activity Requirements, Airborne Exposure, Assistant Devices Resources, Characteristics, Emotional Response, Task Avoidance and Time Extension as they related to dyspnea.
The 33-item Severity bank assesses the severity of difficulty breathing during various specific activities (the same 33 activities assessed in Dyspnea Functional Limitations). Each activity is rated in terms of degree of dyspnea (0 = no shortness of breath, 1 = mildly short of breath, 2 = moderately short of breath, 3 = severely short of breath) while engaging in the activity over the past 7 days. Total scores range from 0 to 99 with higher scores reflecting greater levels of dyspnea during daily activity.</description>

    <description>Outcome reported as the number of participants in each arm who fall into each of 7 categories. Lower scores indicate greater condition severity. The ordinal scale is an assessment of the clinical status at the first assessment of a given study day. The scale is as follows: 1) Death; 2) Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); 3) Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 4) Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 5) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen; 6) Not hospitalized, limitation on activities; 7) Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities.</description>
