  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study aims to assess the feasibility, acceptance and clinical outcomes of a
      practical high-dose aiTBS protocol, including tapering treatments and symptom-based relapse
      prevention treatments, in patients with unipolar depression previously responsive to ECT and
      patients needing urgent treatment due to symptom severity during the COVID-19 pandemic.

    <description>In the acute treatment phase, treatment will occur 8 times daily (50 min pause between treatments) on weekdays, until symptom remission is achieved (HRSD-24 score &lt; to 10) or a maximum of 10 working days of daily treatment. In the tapering phase, treatments will be reduced to 2 treatment days per week for 2 weeks and then 1 treatment day per week for 2 weeks (4 weeks total). Patients will then enter the symptom-based relapse prevention phase including virtual check-in with study staff and a treatment schedule based on symptom level according to a modified relapse prevention algorithm that has been developed to prevent relapse after a successful course of ECT (known as the STABLE algorithm). The relapse prevention phase will last a maximum of 6 months.</description>

    <description>Treatment will occur 8 times per treatment day (50 min pause between treatments). Each treatment session will consist of a single iTBS treatment, delivering 600 pulses of iTBS (bursts of 3 pulses at 50 Hz, bursts repeated at 5 Hz, with a duty cycle of 2 seconds on, 8 seconds off, over 60 cycles / ~3 minutes) at a target of 110% of the subject's resting MT.</description>
