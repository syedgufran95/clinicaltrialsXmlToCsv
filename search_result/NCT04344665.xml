    <textblock>
      The Post discharge after surgery Virtual Care with Remote Automated Monitoring technology
      (PVC-RAM) Trial is a multicentre, parallel group, superiority, randomized controlled trial to
      determine the effect of virtual care with remote automated monitoring (RAM) technology
      compared to standard care on days alive at home during the 30-day follow-up after
      randomization, in adults who have undergone semi-urgent (e.g., oncology), urgent (e.g., hip
      fracture), or emergency (e.g., ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm) surgery. It will also
      determine, during the first 30 days, the effect of virtual care with RAM technology on
      several secondary outcomes, including: 1. hospital re-admission; 2. emergency department
      visit; 3. urgent-care centre visit; 4. acute-hospital care (i.e., a composite of hospital
      re-admission and emergency department or urgent-care centre visit) 5. brief acute-hospital
      care (i.e., acute-hospital care that lasts &lt;24 hours); 6. all-cause hospital days; 7.
      COVID-19 infection; 8. medication error detection; 9. medication error correction; 10.
      delirium; 11. surgeon, family physician, or specialist in-person clinic visit; 12. surgeon,
      family physician, or specialist virtual clinic visit; 13. sepsis; 14. acute heart failure;
      and 15. death. An additional secondary objective is to determine the effect of virtual care
      with RAM technology on pain at 7, 15, and 30 days and 6 months after randomization.

    <description>Days alive at home are the number of days patients spend at their usual residence - be it a house or apartment, a group home or shelter, a seniors residence, or a nursing home - or at a community residence of a relative, friend, or acquaintance without, during that day, being admitted to a hospital or visiting an emergency department or urgent-care centre. Thus, patients lose days alive at home if 1. patients go to an emergency department or urgent-care centre; 2. they become inpatients at a hospital or rehabilitation or convalescence-care facility; or 3. they die.</description>

    <description>Medication errors include mistakes in medication prescribing, transcribing, dispensing, administering, or monitoring due to preventable events or actions taken by a patient, caregiver, or healthcare worker. Medication errors include: drug omission (i.e., patient did not take a drug they were supposed to take), drug commission (i.e., patient taking a drug they were not supposed to take), duration error, dosing error, frequency error, route error, and timing error. We will record all drug errors identified and also report whether they resulted in harm.</description>

    <description>Patients will measure daily vitals (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, temperature, weight) with remote monitoring technology and complete recovery surveys daily in home after discharge from hospital. Patients will interact with a virtual nurse daily on days 1-15 and every other day from days 16-30. If the patient's RAM measurements exceed predetermined thresholds, the patient reports specific symptoms (e.g., shortness of breath), a drug error is identified, or the virtual nurse has concerns about the patient's health that they cannot resolve, the virtual nurse will escalate care to a pre-assigned and available physician. Physicians will add or modify treatments as needed, and if required, they will have the patient come to an outpatient facility for evaluation or management. Via secure video or text messaging, patients will also have access to a virtual nurse at night, for any urgent issues.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. are ≥40 years of age;

          2. have undergone same-day or inpatient semi-urgent, urgent, or emergency surgery and are
             being discharged home or are within 24 hours after discharge home, as long as they
             have not had acute-hospital care since their discharge; and

          3. provide informed consent to participate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. underwent same-day surgery and the surgeon or anesthesiologist believe the case
             reflects a traditional same-day surgery case with a low likelihood of needing
             acute-hospital care;

          2. went to rehabilitation or convalescent care for more than 7 days after undergoing
             surgery;

          3. are unable to communicate with research staff, complete study surveys, or undertake an
             interview using a tablet computer due to a cognitive, language, visual, or hearing
             impairment; or

          4. reside in an area without cellular network coverage and no home Wi-Fi.
