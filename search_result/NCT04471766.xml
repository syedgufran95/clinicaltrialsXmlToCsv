  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of cases of COVID-19 is still increasing and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 seems to
      occur mainly through person-to-person transmission through respiratory droplets, indirect
      contact with infected people and surfaces. The use of face masks is recommended as a public
      health measure, but in many settings only domestic cloth made masks are available to the
      majority of the people. However, masks can be of different quality and very little is known
      about the utility of cloth face masks at the community level.

      In Bandim Health Project's Health and Demographic Surveillance System we will evaluate the
      effect of providing locally produced cloth face masks on severity of COVID-19 like illness
      and mortality in an urban population. The locally produced cloth mask is made according to a
      laboratory certified model and will be provided to the intervention group alongside
      information of how the risk of transmission can be reduced. The control group will receive
      information alone.

      Follow-up will be implemented through telephone calls and post-epidemic home visits.
