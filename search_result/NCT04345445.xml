  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of Methylprednisolone versus Tocilizumab
      in improving clinical outcomes and reducing the need for ventilator support in COVID-19
      patients with moderate COVID-19 disease at risk for complications of cytokine storm.
      Approximately 310 participants hospitalized with COVID-19 in UMMC, Hospital Sungai Buloh,
      Hospital Kuala Lumpur and Hospital Tuanku Jaafar will be enrolled into this study.

      Eligible participants will be selected based on a set of clinical, laboratory and
      radiological parameters indicative of early stages of CRS and lung function decline prior to
      being randomized at a ratio of 1:1 to receive either Tocilizumab or Methylprednisolone.
      Participants will be monitored daily for clinical and laboratory parameters, and at 48 hours,
      switched to the alternate study arm should they manifest signs and symptoms indicative of
      decompensation.
