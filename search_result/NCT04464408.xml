  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Favipiravir is a selective and potent inhibitor of inﬂuenza viral RNA polymerase. It acts as
      a purine analogue, which selectively inhibits viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRps). It
      has the characteristic of acting on RNA viruses including Ebola and Coronaviruses especially
      novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy
      and safety of Favipiravir in comparison to placebo in the treatment of mild COVID-19 cases.
      It is a Multicenter, randomized double-blinded, parallel-group trial.
