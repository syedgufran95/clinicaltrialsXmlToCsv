  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Covid-19 (English acronym meaning coronavirus disease 2019) is an emerging infectious disease
      caused by a strain of coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. The current pandemic has resulted in a
      significant number of admissions in the emergency room (ER) due to suspicion of COVID-19
      infection. Use of lung ultrasound is standard practice to diagnose acute respiratory failure
      in ER. Recently, typical lung ultrasonographic characteristics of COVID-19 disease has been
      described. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of this tool could be of interest in order
      to allow an early, simple and reliable triage in patients with suspected COVID-19 infection
      admitted in ER. In addition, the visualization of early signs in specific areas could be a
      predictive marker of the severity of the disease. The objective of this project will be to
      study the association between the signs on lung ultrasound and the result of RT-PCR in
      patients with suspected COVID-19 infection in the ER.
