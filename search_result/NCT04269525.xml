      Serious Pneumonia and Critical Pneumonia caused by the 2019-nCOV infection greatly threats
      patients' life, UC-MSCs treatment has been proved to play a role in curing multiple diseases.
      And this study is conducted to find out whether or not it will function in 2019-nCOV
      infection Pneumonia. And we are going to get the permission of the enrolled patients. Besides
      the present clinical treatment, UC-MSCs treatment will be applied to those fulfilling the
      enrollment. After a period of UC-MSCs treatment, the analysis of UC-MSCs treatment will be
      completed from related aspects.
