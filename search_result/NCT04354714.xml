  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that JAK 1/2 inhibition with ruxolitinib, an FDA approved
      treatment for intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis, could have a similar effect in
      patients with severe COVID-19, quelling the immune-hyperactivation, allowing for clearance of
      the virus and reversal of the disease manifestations.
