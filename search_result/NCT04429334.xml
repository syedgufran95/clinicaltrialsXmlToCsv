  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, in which one dose of nangibotide will
      be tested versus placebo.

      All patients with a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and a requirement for
      invasive mechanical ventilation will be considered for study participation. All study
      patients will receive standard of care treatment throughout the study. After screening for
      eligibility, patients will be randomized to one of two treatment arms. Patients will receive
      a continuous intravenous (i.v.) infusion of nangibotide at 1.0 mg/kg/h or a matching placebo.
      Treatment with study drug must be initiated as early as possible but no later than 48 hours
      after the initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation. Patients will be treated for 5 days
      or until discharge from critical care, whichever is sooner. The treatment with study drug
      will be in addition to standard of care. A follow-up visit will be performed on days 8 and
      14. The end of study visit is at day 28.
