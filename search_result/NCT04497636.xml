  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence suggests that social isolation affects mental health by increasing symptoms of
      anxiety and depression. One of the main components of the current COVID-19 pandemic is the
      social isolation imposed on the population. This study seeks to assess the impact of the
      physical and social living conditions of the pandemic in a cohort of urban immigrants in
      Chile (i.e. STRING) evaluated six months prior to the pandemic.

      Specific aims are to

        1. Describe the variations in the levels of mental health of immigrants during and after
           the pandemic,

        2. Calculate the effect of social isolation on the levels of mental health of the immigrant
           population, and

        3. Identify risk / protective factors associated with increased mental health problems

      An online survey will be applied to the STRING cohort at two moments of the pandemic (i.e.
      during quarantines and after six months).

    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9; Kroenke, Spitzer &amp; Williams, 2001) is used to measure symptoms of depression in accordance with the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder. The questionnaire consists of nine items scored on a four-point Likert scale (0-3), with the range of scores from 0 to 27. Higher scores indicate greater depression severity, and scores above 10 are considered as the cut-off that indicating that the patient is within the depressive area. Specific cut-off for primary care samples in Chile have been found yielding a cut-off of 7 and above for high sensitivity and specificity (Saldivia, Aslan, Cova, Vicente, Inostroza &amp; Rincón, 2019)</description>

    <description>The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7; Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams &amp; Löwe, 2006) is used to measure symptoms of anxiety and worry. The questionnaire consists of seven items scored on a four-point Likert scale (0-3), with the scores ranging from 0 to 21. Specific cut-off for primary care samples in Spain have been found yielding a cut-off of 10 and above for high sensitivity and specificity (García-Campayo et al, 2010).</description>

    <description>The Impact of Events Scale (IES-R; Weiss &amp; Marmar, 1997) is used to measure symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). There scale consists of 22 questions which are scored on a five-point Likert scale (0=not at all, 1=a little bit, 2=moderately, 3=quite a bit, 4=extremely). There are three subscales (i.e., avoidance, intrusion, hyperarousal) and the sum of the three subscales scores comprise the total score. A total score ≥33 indicates the likely presence of PTSD using criteria from the Diagnostic Symptom Manual (DSM-IV).</description>
