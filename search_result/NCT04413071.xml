  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will analyze the prevalence of cardiac involvement of health care workers from the
      University Hospital of Salamanca (HUSA) who have overcome SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants
      will undergo a clinical evaluation, electrocardiogram (EKG), cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
      and blood analysis including NT-proBNP, troponin, cellular and humoral immunity and genetics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience mild, self-limiting symptoms that have been
      managed in an outpatient setting and therefore have not undergone routine cardiac evaluation
      with EKG or cardiac imaging test. Similarly, although the emphasis has been placed on
      evaluating patients with severe respiratory symptoms, most of these patients have also not
      undergone cardiac imaging tests and; therefore, in both scenarios, possible myocarditis has
      not routinely evaluated.

      The present study is designed to characterize cardiac involvement in individuals who have
      overcome the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      For that aim, the study is designed as an observational cross-sectional study. The target
      population are HUSA healthcare workers who have overcome SARS-CoV-2 infection, either
      symptomatic or asymptomatic, either having required hospital admission or not. Participants
      will undergo a clinical evaluation, electrocardiogram (EKG), cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
      and blood analysis including NT-proBNP, troponin, cellular and humoral immunity and genetics.

      Main objectives of the study are to address the prevalence of myocardial damage suggestive of
      myocarditis and to address the prevalence of pericarditis in HUSA health care workers; both
      related to the systemic immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. As secondary objectives the
      study will further address other cardiac affections including: rhythm or conduction
      disorders, ischemic heart disease, dilatation of the right chambers, valve disease and will
      analyze the relationship between humoral and cellular immunity and the presence of cardiac
      involvement, and the genetic susceptibility in the development of cardiac involvement after
      SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      The study will recruit 141 participants: 47 symptomatic hospitalized health care workers, 47
      asymptomatic non-hospitalized health care workers, 47 asymptomatic health care workers

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have overcome the SARS-CoV-2 infection meeting any of the following criteria (i)
             positive result on a reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of
             a specimen collected on a nasopharyngeal swab followed by a second negative RT-PCR and
             at least 14 days from this negative RT-PCR; (ii) presence of IgM antibodies and
