  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 1, open label, non-randomized, two-arm interventional clinical trial to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of Virazole® in hospitalized adult patients who have tested
      positive for COVID-19 and, as a result, have significant respiratory distress (PaO2/FiO2
      ratio &lt;300 mmHg).

    <measure>Change in the clinical status severity (CSS) rating from the first dose date up to the completion of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The severity rating will be based on the ordinal scale of clinical status as follows:
Death.
Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices.
Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen.
Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen.
Not hospitalized, limitation on activities.
Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or non-pregnant female ≥ 18 years of age.

          2. Willing and able to provide written informed consent (or provided by a proxy).

          3. Currently hospitalized with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 novel coronavirus infection.

          4. PaO2/FiO2 ratio &lt;300 mmHg.

          5. Illness of any duration, and at least one of the following:

               -  Radiographic infiltrates by imaging (chest x-ray, CT scan, etc.), OR

               -  Clinical assessment (evidence of rales/crackles on exam) AND SpO2 ≤94% on room
                  air, OR

               -  Requiring mechanical ventilation and/or supplemental oxygen.

          6. Once released from the hospital, women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and all men
             must agree to use at contraception methods for 9 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or breast feeding.

          2. Respiratory distress for reasons other than COVID-19 infection (e.g., congestive heart
             failure (CHF), bacterial pneumonia, etc.).

          3. Presence of secondary bacterial pneumonia.

          4. Presence of significant pulmonary fibrosis.

          5. Hypotension (need for hemodynamic pressors to maintain blood pressure).

          6. Greater than 7 days on mechanical ventilation.

          7. Anemia defined as hemoglobin or RBC &lt;75% of the institutional lower limit of normal
             for race, age and gender.

          8. History of COPD or bronchospasm prior to COVID-19 infection.

          9. History of hypersensitivity to ribavirin.

         10. Any condition that could cause noncompliance with treatment or may otherwise
             contraindicate the subject's participation in the study

         11. Subject is currently participating in any drug or device clinical investigation.

         12. Subject has received an investigational agent or approved drug that, in the
             Investigator's judgement, may have a chemical or pharmacological interaction with
             Virazole if administered within 5 half-lives or 30 days of the Baseline Visit.
