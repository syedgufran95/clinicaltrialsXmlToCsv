  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rehabilitation interventions can help address the consequences of COVID-19. These include
      medical, physical, cognitive and psychological related problems. To our knowledge, no studies
      have investigated the effects of rehabilitation following discharge from hospital. The
      specific aims of this project are to investigate the effects of a 12-week exercise program on
      pulmonary fibrosis in recovering COVID-19 patients. A further aim will be to examine how
      Chinese herbal medicines, gut microbiome and its metabolites regulate immune function and
      possibly autoimmune deficiency in the rehabilitation process.

      The study will develop a new paradigm for patient rehabilitation needed now and in the
      future. The specific aims of this project are to investigate the effects of a 12-week
      programme with cardiorespiratory exercise and Chinese herbal medicine on recovering COVID-19
      patients and to collect qualitative and quantitative data to examine loneliness, anxiety,
      depression, quality of life, and mental health. A further aim will be to examine how Chinese
      herbal medicines, gut microbiome, and its metabolites regulate immune function, intestinal
      permeability, and possibly autoimmune deficiency (AID) in the pathological
      recovery/rehabilitation process.

      In this multicenter, triple-blinded, randomized, parallel groups, controlled clinical trial,
      we will recruit adult patients with COVID-19 who have been diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis
      and have been discharged from the hospital in Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland.

      A total of 172 eligible patients will be randomized 1:1:1:1 into four groups:
      cardiorespiratory exercise plus Chinese herbal medicines group, cardiorespiratory exercise
      group, Chinese herbal medicines group and waiting list group for 12-week (3 months) with
      12-week follow-up period.

      A 4-week pilot study will be conducted to test patient recruitment and maintenance, data
      collection, instrumentation, and to observe the adaptability and practicality of the
      intervention.Amendments will be made if necessary.

    <description>Anxiety and stress will be measured using the Chinese version of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21). The scale will discriminate between the negative emotional syndromes of depression, anxiety, and stress in Chinese populations. Only the subscales of anxiety and stress will be used.
The anxiety scale assesses autonomic arousal, skeletal muscle effects, situational anxiety, and subjective experience of anxious affect. The stress scale is sensitive to levels of chronic nonspecific arousal. It assesses difficulty relaxing, nervous arousal, and being easily upset/agitated, irritable/over-reactive &amp; impatient.
The rating scale is as follows:
0=Did not apply to me at all
Applied to me to some degree, or some of the time
Applied to me to a considerable degree or a good part of time
Applied to me very much or most of the time
Scores are calculated by summing the scores for the relevant items. Higher scores indicate greater degrees of anxiety and stress.</description>
