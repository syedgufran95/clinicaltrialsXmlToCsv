  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SARS-CoV-2 infection detected in China in December 2019 is responsible for the current
      COVID-19 pandemic affecting nearly 1.2 million people worldwide to date. Infection with this
      virus of the coronavirus family is causing a broad clinical spectrum, the main manifestation
      of which is an influenza-like condition associated with a pattern of severe hypoxemia
      pneumonia, and in some cases fatal. Little is known about this pathology, so we propose to
      carry out an observational cohort of patients treated in our hospital for an SARS-CoV-2
      infection.

      This cohort should make it possible to clinically, biologically and radiologically
      characterize the SARS-CoV-2 infections. We will also collect the therapeutic strategies
      implemented, their possible toxicity and the evolution of the patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is a virus belonging to the coronavirus family, which includes a large number of
      viruses that can cause a wide variety of diseases in humans. The SARS-CoV-2 virus that caused
      the current COVID-19 pandemic, although widely described in the literature, still has many
      grey areas. The main clinical manifestation is an influenza-like illness associated with
      respiratory tract infection that can lead to severe hypoxemic pneumonia with fatal outcomes
      in 2.3% of cases. The clinical spectrum is not yet very well known, as evidenced by the
      evidence of anosmia, agueusia, or recent skin manifestations, but also strong suspicion of
      possible neurological damage. Similarly, it is not yet very well established, apart from
      certain co-morbidities, which patients are likely to develop serious forms requiring
      admission to intensive care, as shown by the proportion of patients &lt; 60 years of age
      admitted to intensive care for ARDS.

      Moreover, the question of how to manage these patients still raises many questions,
      particularly about the type of molecules to be introduced and at what point in the history of
      the disease. Some of these molecules, such as the Lopinavir/Ritonavir combinations and the
      Hydroxychloroquine/ Azithromycin combination, are not free of complications, particularly
      cardiac complications requiring close monitoring by ECGs and repeated dosing, the
      effectiveness of which has not yet been clearly demonstrated.

      In order to better understand this infection, we propose to set up a cohort of patients
      treated for CoV-2 SARS infection on our site.

      Study scheme:

      Longitudinal cohort study of patients with confirmed or strongly suspected CoV-2 SARS
      infection.
