      According to the results of nonclinical study of humanized Meplazumab for Injection, a single
      dose will be used for the treatment. The treatment plan is first dose on the first day (0d)
      and second dose on the second day (1D) of the treatment period by intravenous(IV) infusion,
      each dose 10mg; The third dose will be given within 3-5 days after the second dose according
      to the patient's 2019-nCoV nucleic acid load, clinical manifestations and the overall
      evaluation of doctors, dose is 10mg. 30 mg of methylprednisolone will be given intravenously
      30 minutes before each administration. Each subject will be evaluated the therapeutic effect
      within 28 days after the first administration, and to determine the preliminary therapeutic
      effect, safety and tolerability of humanized Meplazumab for Injection.
