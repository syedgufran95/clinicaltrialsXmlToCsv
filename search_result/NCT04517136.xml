  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress is underpinned by a biological reaction of the organism allowing the production of
      energy to respond to a change in the environment (or stressor). Stress reaction is expressed
      in behavioural, cognitive, emotional and physiological terms. This biological response is
      non-specific because it is the same regardless of the stressor. Its evolution over time has
      been conceptualised by Hans Selye (1956) in the General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS) which
      comprises three successive phases. (i) The first phase, known as the alarm phase, corresponds
      to the activation of all biological mechanisms according to a trend regulation, allowing a
      rapid response to the stressor. (ii) The second phase of resistance which adjusts the stress
      response to the intensity of the perceived aggression according to a constant regulation.
      (iii) When the aggression disappears, a recovery phase dominated by the return of the
      parasympathetic brake allows a return to homeostasis (eustress).

      The &quot;primum movens&quot; of all pathologies is therefore the inability of the individual to adapt
      his stress response in duration and/or intensity to the course of the phases of the GAS
      (distress). The perception of not being in control of the situation contributes to the
      perceived stress and constitutes a well-established risk of distress. It is a risk factor for
      the emergence of burnout. It induces a biological cost called allostatic cost. Allostasis is
      a concept that characterizes the process of restoring homeostasis in the presence of a
      physiological challenge. The term &quot;allostasis&quot; means &quot;achieving stability through change&quot;,
      and refers in part to the process of increasing sympathetic activity and corticotropic axis
      to promote adaptation and restore homeostasis. Allostasis works well when allostasis systems
      are initiated when needed and turned off when they are no longer required. Restoring
      homeostasis involves effective functioning of the parasympathetic system. However, when the
      allostasis systems remain active, such as during chronic stress, they can cause tissue
      burnout and accelerate pathophysiological processes.

      The perception of uncontrollability depends on the stress situation, the psychological and
      physiological characteristics of the subject and his or her technical skills in responding to
      the stressors of the situation. In particular, subjects with a high level of mindfulness are
      more accepting of uncontrollability and less likely to activate the stress response.

      The COVID-19 pandemic situation is a situation characterized by many uncertainties about the
      individual, family and work environment and the risk of COVID infection. Healthcare workers,
      like the military, are high-risk occupations that are particularly exposed to these
      uncertainties in the course of their work and continue to work in an uncertain situation.
      These professionals are described as a population at risk of occupational/operational burnout
      that the level of burnout operationalises. This ancillary study in a population of civilian
      and military non-healthcare workers will complement the study conducted among military health
      care workers. It will make it possible to isolate the specificity of each profession
      (civilian or military, healthcare personnel or not) with regard to the risk of burnout in the
      COVID context.

      The objective of this project is to evaluate the impact of the perception of non-control in
      the operational burnout of experts in their field of practice and to study the psychological
      and physiological mechanisms mediating the relationship between the subject's
      characteristics, perceived non-control and burnout.

    <measure>Professional burnout</measure>
    <time_frame>21 days after enrollment (Day 21)</time_frame>
    <description>Professional burnout is measured at D21 by the Burnout Measure Short Version (BMS) questionnaire It is a 10-item questionnaire used to assess burnout regardless of the occupational category.
Each item is rated from 0 to 6 (&quot;never&quot; to &quot;always&quot;). An average score (sum/10) below 2.4 indicates a very low degree of burnout exposure; a score between 2.5 and 3.4 indicates a low degree of burnout exposure; a score between 3.5 and 4.4 indicates the presence of burnout; a score between 4.5 and 5.4 indicates a high degree of burnout exposure; a score above 5.5 indicates a very high degree of burnout exposure.</description>

    <measure>Mindfulness level</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Mindfulness level is assessed at D0 thanks to the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory.
It is a 14 item scale. Each item is rated from 1 to 4 (&quot;almost never&quot; to &quot;almost always&quot;). The total score is between 14 and 56. The mean value in a population of young adults under 36 years of age is 38.5 (+/- 5.1 standard deviation).</description>

    <description>Perceived stress level is assessed with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). It is a 14 item scale. Each item is rated from 0 to 5 (&quot;never&quot; to &quot;very often&quot;). The total score ranges from 0 to 56 with higher scores indicating greater perceived stress.</description>
