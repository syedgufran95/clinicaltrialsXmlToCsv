    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this research study is to assess Radiation Oncology healthcare
      providers (i.e. faculty, residents and advanced practice providers (APPs) implementation and
      perception of telehealth for on treatment patients in lieu of in person on treatment visits
      during standard of care radiotherapy during COVID-19.

      A secondary aim will be to evaluate the rates of acute care during COVID-19 with telehealth
      in comparison to the rates during our prior Quality Improvement (QI) project (NCT04277650),
      considering the risk prediction based on our previously developed ML algorithm. Patient risk
      during this period will be assessed by the ML algorithm and actual rates of Emergency
      Department visits and hospitalizations (acute encounters) will be compared to the results of
      our prior QI project. These data will be used to discern how actual rates of acute care
      compare to providers' expectations both with and without telehealth implementation. Reasons
      for acute encounters and associated healthcare costs compared to patients undergoing standard
      of care assessments in NCT04277650 will be assessed to determine the percentage that are
      COVID-19 related. Basic demographic, disease, location of acute care, form of clinical
      assessments (video, in-person, telephone, etc.), and treatment information regarding the
      patients will also be captured following the completion of the research project for
      assessment.

      These endpoints will establish how our current COVID-19-based precautions impact
      treatment-related outcomes in patient care.
