    <textblock>
      A prospective, controlled, randomized, multicenter study whose goal is to compare the
      efficacy of a chloroquine analog (GNS561), an anti PD-1 (nivolumab), an anti-NKG2A
      (monalizumab), an anti-C5aR (avdoralimab) and an anti-interleukine-6 receptor (tocilizumab)
      versus standard of care in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer who have Sars-CoV-2
      infection not eligible to a resuscitation unit.

      According to their severity level at the time of enrolment, eligible patients will be
      randomized into 2 different cohorts:

        -  COHORT 1 (mild symptoms or asymptomatic): GNS561 vs anti-PD1 vs anti-NKG2A vs standard
           of care (randomization ratio 1:1:1:1).

        -  COHORT 2 (moderate/severe symptoms): GNS561 vs anti-IL6 vs anti-C5aR vs standard of care
           (randomization ratio 1:1:1:1).
