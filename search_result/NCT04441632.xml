  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly elevated levels of stress to people all over the globe,
      but none more than to the providers on the front-line. The purpose of the study is to first,
      assess the effects of the pandemic on burnout, team cohesion, and resiliency among healthcare
      providers battling COVID-19 together in a medical ICU (MICU). Secondly, the investigators
      hope to then assess the effects of simple positive feedback on transforming culture and
      attitudes during times of major stress.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Teamwork climate, as measured by selected items from the validated Safety Attitude Questionnaire (SAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SAQ measures teamwork climate, safety climate, job satisfaction, stress recognition, perceptions of management, and working conditions. The six items assessing teamwork climate will be used. 5 point likert scale is used. Mean of the items - 1 * 25 will convert each participant's results to a 100 point scale (0, 25, 50, 75, 100 points).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Resiliency, as measured by the validated Brief Resilience Scale (BRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BRS is comprised of 6 items on a likert scale. Responses varying from 1-5 for all six items give a total range of 6-30. This sum will be divided by the total number of questions for a final score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Burnout, as validated by the single-item burnout scale inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This single item inventory provides 5 definitions of burnout that the participant will choose that most closely fits their personal level of burnout at the moment</description>
