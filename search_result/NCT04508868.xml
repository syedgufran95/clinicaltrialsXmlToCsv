      This research study is designed to investigate the effects of a brief psychological
      intervention for improving depressed mood in older individuals (65 years and older) in
      isolation during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The treatment is delivered by telephone
      and consists of four weekly individual sessions. Two therapeutic methods are used in
      combination during this intervention: Behavioral activation (BA) and Mental Imagery (MI). BA
      involves identifying and scheduling enjoyable and meaningful activities to improve mood and
      reduce social isolation. To enhance BA efficacy and adherence, MI is paired with BA as MI is
      known to activate emotion and motivation. The MI intervention in this study involves having
      participants imagine, in vivid sensory detail, engaging in some of the activities that are
      scheduled during BA.

      Approximately 154 individuals will participate in the study. Half of the participants will be
      randomised to start the intervention immediately, while the other half of the participants
      will be randomized to a control group receiving the intervention after 4 weeks. This
      procedure makes it possible to evaluate the effects of the treatment while not disadvantaging
      participants randomized to the control group. Participants will be asked to fill in
      questionnaires before, during (at the end of each intervention week), and after treatment (or
      waiting period for the control group). Questionnaires will also be sent 1-, 3- and 6 months
      after treatment to follow up on the results. A smaller group of participants (10-15) will be
      asked to participate in a more detailed interview about how they experienced the treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus (COVID-19) has become a worldwide pandemic. The mortality rates are highest in
      the older age groups, particularly in those 70 years and older. In Sweden, the government
      urges people 70 years and older to limit close contact with other people and to stay at home
      as much as possible, a strategy called social distancing. From previous epidemics, such as
      the SARS-epidemic, we know that quarantine and isolation leads to psychological symptoms such
      as stress, irritability, depressed mood and sleep problems. About 30% of those subjected to
      isolation and quarantine become depressed, and in a study from Hong Kong during SARS there
      was a nearly 32% increase of suicide rates among individuals 65 years and older. In Sweden,
      depression among the elderly was a major public health concern before the covid-19-pandemic -
      Major depression occurred in 5-15 % of the older population in Sweden, and one third of the
      women and a fifth of the men 65 years and older reported subclinical depressive symptoms.
      Several mental health experts raise concerns that there will be an increase of psychiatric
      illness during and after covid-19, particularly among the elderly.

      Depression in older individuals can be treated with antidepressant medication, psychological
      interventions and physical activity. However, the majority of the older individuals state
      that they would prefer psychological treatments to medication, which poses a challenge during
      COVID-19 as such treatments are often delivered face-to-face. Psychological treatments
      delivered via the Internet are as efficacious as face-to-face, but only 3-4% of the
      individuals 65 years and above in Sweden use digital applications that replace physical
      healthcare visits.

      Psychological treatments have been shown to work when delivered via telephone, and since
      practically every household in Sweden has access to a telephone, the investigators believe
      this could be a feasible option. Preferably, the treatment should be brief yet effective, and
      easily accessible for healthcare professionals. One such treatment is brief behavioral
      activation (BA), which is aimed at increasing enjoyable and meaningful activities to improve
      mood. BA has been shown to be feasible in as few as four sessions. Depression is often
      accompanied by low motivation and lack of energy, which can pose a problem when trying to
      increase activities. One way of increasing motivation in BA and the likelihood of performing
      the planned activities is to add mental imagery (MI), where some of these activities are
      imagined in detail during the calls.

      However, there are to the investigators knowledge no studies of telephone-delivered brief BA
      for older individuals, no studies of the combination of BA and MI for depression in the
      elderly, and no studies of either of these during pandemics with isolation or quarantine.

      The aim of the present study is to investigate the feasibility, effect and experience of
      telephone-delivered Behavioral Activation with Mental Imagery for the treatment of depressive
      symptoms in individuals 65 years and older during the covid-19-pandemic.
