  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current outbreak of Covid-19 requires the wearing of FFP2 respiratory protective devices
      by healthcare personnel to limit their contamination.

      However, there is currently a shortage of masks in France due to insufficient national stocks
      while the disease is spreading.

      There is an urgent need to save FFP2 masks to enable healthcare personnel to continue to
      provide care in complete safety. Contamination of staff due to insufficient masks would have
      consequences by limiting access to care for infected patients and putting caregivers at
      potential risk of death. Caregiver protection is also intended to contain the risk of
      nosocomial epidemics. We propose the use of ARFC masks by Covid-19+ units. These ARFC masks
      provide optimal security against the risk of aerosolization of contaminated biological
      liquids. They are masks modified to be usable by civilians, resulting from the technology of
      combat masks, specially designed for use in NRBC (Nuclear, Radiological, Biological and
      Chemical) atmosphere.
