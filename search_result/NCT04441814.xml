  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the current pandemic, in Italy the majority of asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic
      COVID-19 cases were not identified nor diagnosed and this fact caused a decrease in the
      effectiveness of the various containment measures implemented. Therefore, in a future
      scenario where a new viral swarm is expected, the early identification of all infected cases
      becomes essential to plan and activate a containment strategy for the spread of the virus,
      given the current absence of vaccines.

      The typical radiological finding of COVID-19 is an interstitial pneumonia, which can be
      responsible, in a significant portion of patients, of an acute respiratory distress syndrome
      (ARDS).

      Low-dose chest CT and simple blood tests could identify sub-solid pulmonary nodules (SSNs)
      indicative of COVID-19 infection in asymptomatic subjects.

      Objectives of this observational study are the early detection of COVID-19 markers indicative
      of prior exposure or persisting viral infection in asymptomatic subjects and the assessment
      of the frequency and outcome of COVID-19-related SSNs in asymptomatic subjects by time,
      domicile, and other individual risk factors.

      SMILE lung CT screening program cohort has been considered, based on 960 subjects at high
      lung cancer risk for tobacco smoking (≥20 pack/year) and age (50-75 years), together with
      inflammatory and respiratory profile. SMILE utilizes a top technology dual-source CT scanner
      (Somatom Force) with the lowest radiation dose ever applied to lung screening. All chest CT
      images from screening subjects will be re-evaluated by two additional CAD programs,
      specifically designed for the analysis of SSNs and quantification of the total volume of lung
      parenchyma showing an increased density. This re-evaluation will improve the sensitivity and
      specificity of radiomic assessment.

      This study cohort, enriched by the already established longitudinal biobank of frozen plasma
      samples, represent an ideal opportunity to assess the frequency of SSNs in asymptomatic
      subjects, due to the effect of COVID-19, particularly among subjects living in areas at high
      risk of viral exposure. It will also be possible to evaluate if COVID-19-related SSNs are
      associated with chronic co-morbidity, other individual risk factors, inflammatory (CRP) /
      immunomodulatory (25(OH)D) blood profile, and/or can be traced by immune markers such as
      IgM/IgG and other cytokines.

      Clinical data will be integrated with an analysis of the IgG-IgM profile specific for
      covid-19, on the plasma samples taken at the time of the CT scan, or subsequently, in
      collaboration with University of Milan, Luigi Devoto Work Clinic.

      The lasting collaboration with the Radiological Science Department of the University of Parma
      in lung screening also offers the opportunity to validate the results obtained in this cohort
      on chest CT performed at the University Parma Hospital during the last two months in
      symptomatic subjects for suspected covid-19 pneumonia.

      In collaboration with University of Milano Bicocca, Machine Learning (ML) tools will be
      applied to predict the clinical relevance, severity and ultimate outcome of SSNs, based on
      radiomic CT features, epidemiologic risk, co-morbidity and inflammatory/immune blood
      biomarkers. ML analysis will generate a predictive algorithm for clinical outcome of SSNs,
      and specifically the risk of COV-I9 infection and unfavorable disease prognosis.
