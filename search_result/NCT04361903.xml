    <textblock>
      It is an observational, cohort, retrospective, monocentric, non-profit study. The primary
      objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib in acute respiratory distress
      syndrome in patients with SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 with rapid deterioration of respiratory
      parameters in the last 12 hours.

      It is an observational, cohort, retrospective, monocentric, non-profit study. Patients with
      SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 pneumonia who started off-label Ruxolitinib treatment in the period
      between 25/03/2020 and 07/04/2020 in hospitalization in the COVID-19 wards of the USL Toscana
      Nord Ovest company.

      Primary objective

      - Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib in acute respiratory distress syndrome
      in patients with SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 with rapid deterioration of respiratory parameters in
      the last 12 hours.

      Secondary objectives

        -  Improvement of respiratory performance.

        -  Improvement of acute phase inflammation indices.

        -  Evaluation of known adverse events related to the use of the drug.

        -  Evaluation of the epidemiological parameters in COVID-19 patients.

        -  Monitoring of plasma levels of cytokines before and after treatment. Exploratory
           objectives

        -  Analysis of the outcomes for the launch of a study on the efficacy and safety of
           Ruxolitinib in the treatment of ADRS in COVID-19 patients.
