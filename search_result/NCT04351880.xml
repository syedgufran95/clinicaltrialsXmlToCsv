      The purpose of this study is to determine if medically tailored meals provided for either 2
      weeks or 4 weeks (1 meal per day) to a Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO) member after
      hospital discharge will improve their health. Medically tailored meals (MTM) are meals that
      are approved by a dietitian and shown to help people with certain health conditions.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if medically tailored meals provided for either 2
      weeks or 4 weeks (1 meal per day) to a Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO) member after
      hospital discharge will improve their health. Medically tailored meals (MTM) are meals that
      are approved by a dietitian and shown to help people with certain health conditions.

      The Investigators propose a research study with four Specific Aims:

      Specific Aim 1: To determine if MTM provided post hospitalization for 4 weeks to patients
      with one or more of seven chronic health conditions will decrease depression/anxiety measured
      by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at 60 days in comparison to meals
      provided for 2 weeks to members discharged from two hospitals.

      Hypothesis 1: Patients receiving meals for 4 weeks will have a clinically significant
      increase in their HADS score at 60 days compared to those receiving meals for 2 weeks.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine if MTM provided for 4 weeks to patients with one or more of
      seven chronic health conditions post hospitalization will improve general well-being and
      functional status measured by Katz's Activities of Daily Living (ADL).

      Hypothesis 2: Patients receiving meals for 4 weeks will have a clinically significant
      increase in their sense of well-being and ADLs at 60 days compared to those receiving meals
      for 2 weeks.

      Specific Aim 3: To determine if MTM provided for 4 weeks to patients with one or more of
      seven chronic health conditions post hospitalization will decrease a composite outcome of
      rehospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits at 60 days in comparison to: a) meals
      provided for 2 weeks to members discharged from two hospitals; and b) a concurrent
      prospective control group not receiving meals at two other KPCO-contracted hospitals.

      Hypothesis 3: Patients receiving meals for 4 weeks will have a decreased composite rate of
      rehospitalizations and ED visits at 60 days compared to those receiving meals for 2 weeks or
      the non-randomized control group.

      Specific Aim 4: To determine the feasibility, acceptability and scalability of the Meals
      Matter Program to KP members, their households, and hospital leadership and staff.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized trial to compare two approaches to meal delivery. Group 1 will receive meal delivery for 2 weeks (1 meal per day for a total of 14 days) and Group 2 will receive meal delivery for 4 weeks (1 meal per day for a total of 28 days). A concurrent propensity matched control group which will not receive an intervention will also be used.</intervention_model_description>
