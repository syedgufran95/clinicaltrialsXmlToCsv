    <textblock>
      The Professional Peer Resilience Initiative (PPRI) study is an observational study aimed at
      understanding how symptoms of traumatic stress and resilience evolve over time in the
      University of Minnesota (UMN) healthcare workforce during the coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) pandemic. The study is being conducted concurrently with a UMN peer support
      program called the MinnRAP program and will remotely administer quality of life and mental
      health surveys to healthcare workers before they start the MinnRAP program and throughout
      their participation in the program.
