  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to analyze the microglia reaction or direct neurotropic effects of CNS COVID-19
      in pathogenesis and brain stem dysfunction in critically ill patients. A microglia-focused,
      brain-specific 50+ marker CODEX panel is used to assess the neuroinflammatory
      microenvironment in specific brain regions of deceased COVID-19 patients. The peripheral
      (cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood) cytokine response to SARS-CoV-2 is investigated in
      regard to CNS affection and consecutive blood brain barrier disruption leading to
      braininherent neuroinflammatory reactions

      This study is to analyze the microglia reaction or direct neurotropic effects of CNS COVID-19

      (cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood) cytokine response to SARS-CoV-2 is investigated in
      regard to CNS affection and consecutive blood brain barrier disruption leading to
      braininherent neuroinflammatory reactions. Primary endpoints of this project are the
      multidimensional integration of the analysis from the procedures described above and
      assessment of the correlation between the gained clinical data (MRI, mental/neurological
      state), the body fluid proteomic and mass-cytometric analysis (CSF and Plasma proteomics,
      peripheral blood mass cytometry) and the CODEX analysis of defined brain regions on autopsy
      specimens.

      Non-critically ill COVID-19 patients and critically ill COVID-19 patients needing mechanical
      ventilation at the ICU are included. Autopsy specimens from medulla oblongata, cortex,
      cerebellum and olfactory bulb are investigated, including only tissue samples, which have
      been submitted to the Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Basel.

    <description>High dimensional, microglia-centric CODEX fluorescent microscopy of defined brain regions on autopsy specimens will be acquired from medulla oblongata, cortex, cerebellum, and olfactory bulb. A brain-specific CODEX panel for the assessment of the immune microenvironment was implemented, with inclusion of a wide array of myeloid/microglia markers, T-cell markers, and a few neuronal markers. All the antibodies have been validated and tested in formalin-fixed tissues of different zones of glioblastoma tumors including invading tumor periphery. The Panel will be modified to include the viral entry receptors, CD147, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles will be assessed by qPCR, andMultiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI) technology will be used to visualize tropism of virus to specific cellular brain compartments.</description>

      Biological material is appropriately stored in a restricted area only accessible to
      authorized personnel. The acquired fluids of lumbar puncture, blood withdrawal and autopsy
      (in case of death) are going to be frozen at -80Â° C and stored at Department of Biomedicine,
      University Hospital of Basel. Biological material in this project is not identified by
      participant name but by a unique participant number.
