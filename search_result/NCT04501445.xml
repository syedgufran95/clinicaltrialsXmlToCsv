  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Families of patients in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) are at increased risk for developing
      psychological symptoms that can last for months after the patient is discharged. These
      symptoms can have significant impact on both the patient and family member's quality of life.

      The investigators have found that families of patients admitted to the Rush University
      Medical Center ICU during to the COVID-19 pandemic were more likely to develop clinically
      significant psychological symptoms than families of patients admitted prior to the COVID-19
      pandemic. The investigators suspect that this finding is due in part to the hospital-wide no
      visitation policy that altered our standard communication practices and may have prevented
      families from being active participants in the patient's medical care.

      The goals of this project are 1) to determine the prevalence of psychological disorders among
      families of COVID-19 patients after ICU discharge 2) to determine the characteristics of ICU
      care that were associated with the development of psychological disorders among family
      members and 3) to pilot a program in which families with psychological disorders after ICU
      discharge receive therapy from mental health professionals.

      Part 1- Post-ICU discharge survey and Interview Upon enrollment in this post-ICU discharge
      follow-up study, the subject (surrogate of the ICU patient) will complete a survey dealing
      with the patient's course since Rush discharge

        1. Is the patient still alive?

             1. If deceased, did the patient pass away at Rush or after discharge from Rush?

             2. If alive, is the patient at home?

           i. If at home, for how long? Is he/she receiving home health services?

        2. If the patient did not pass away at Rush, did the patient spend time in a rehabilitation
           hospital, nursing home, or long-term acute care hospital after discharge from Rush?

        3. Is the patient currently having any of the following symptoms (check all that apply).

             1. Fatigue

             2. Trouble Breathing

             3. Difficulty speaking

             4. Difficulty eating

             5. Difficulty thinking or paying attention

             6. Pain or discomfort

             7. Anxiety

             8. Depressed mood

             9. Difficulty moving or walking

            10. Difficulty performing activities of daily living such as dressing or bathing

        4. Have the subject used mental health services since the time the patient was admitted?

        5. What is the subject's overall impression of mental health services (choices ranging from
           very unhelpful to very helpful)

      Subjects will be asked to complete the 1) Critical Care Family Needs Inventory (CCFNI)
      questionnaire, 2) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and 3) Impact of Events Scale
      Revised (IES-R) questionnaire.

      Subjects will participate in a 30-minute phone interview with a psychologist. The
      psychologist will review the subject's responses to the above surveys and ask follow-up
      questions. The psychologist will ask how the subject has been coping with any psychological
      symptoms (i.e. anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress)

      The psychologist will describe different types of interventions for people coping
      psychological symptoms and assess the subject's interest in pursuing any of them.

      The investigators will not begin Part 2 until 10 subjects have completed &quot;Part 1- Post-ICU
      discharge survey and Interview.&quot; The investigators will review survey responses and interview
      transcripts for the first 10 subjects. Based on responses the investigators will determine
      the type(s) of support interventions that will be offered for subjects in this study. An
      amendment to the study protocol will be made at this time.

      Part 2 - Post-ICU psychological intervention Subjects with clinically significant
      psychologist symptoms based on either their survey or interview responses will be invited to
      participate in 6-week trauma-focused intervention with a psychologist. The intervention will
      be individualized to the needs of the subject. It will involve 30-60 minute sessions up to
      once per week conducted by phone or video call.

      At the completion of the intervention, surrogates will complete the 1) Hospital Anxiety and
      Depression Scale (HADS), and 2) Impact of Events Scale Revised (IES-R) questionnaire.

      Subjects will participate in another 30-minute phone interview with a psychologist. The
      psychologist will review the subject's responses to the above surveys and ask follow-up
      questions. The psychologist will ask how the subject has been coping with any psychological
      symptoms (i.e. anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress).

      All interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed. Two members study staff will review
      the transcriptions and use thematic content analysis to determine the types of psychological
      symptoms that are present and the reason(s) they may be present.

      When analyzing subject responses, the investigators will account for the following variables

        -  Whether the patient is deceased or not

        -  Length of time since hospital discharge

        -  Whether the subject received mental health services on their own or not

        -  Whether the subject received daily written summaries in the ICU or not

      Statistical Analysis The investigators expect ~100 subjects to meet inclusion criteria. The
      investigators expect ~70-100 to complete Part 1 (Post-ICU discharge survey and Interview).
      The investigators will determine the prevalence of psychological symptoms and opinions on ICU
      care by reviewing survey responses and interview recordings. The investigators expect ~30 to
      complete Part 2 (Post-ICU discharge survey and Interview). The investigators compare pre- to
      post-intervention survey responses for each subject using a paired t-test. Part 2 will be
      considered a pilot study. The investigators will use the results to plan a future, adequately
      powered study.
