    <textblock>
      Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, two-arm study to evaluate the effectiveness
      and safety of BIO 300 Oral Suspension (BIO 300) for the mitigation of impaired pulmonary
      function in 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) patients recently discharged from the
      hospital. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive BIO 300 or placebo. All patients will
      receive the same background current standard of care.

             ability to comply with study requirements or that may impact the quality or
             interpretation of the data obtained from the study.
