  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to validate the use of human saliva as a substrate for an assay to detect
      SARS-CoV-2 and define accuracy, analytical sensitivity and specificity of the TaqPath RT-PCR
      test.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will carry out validation of a laboratory assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic
      acids in human saliva samples. Data for the validation will include the test results from
      standard nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs (controls) AND matched saliva samples (experimental group)
      of individuals who are either known to be infected or at high risk of being infected.
      Investigators hypothesize that the performance of an assay designed specifically for saliva
      will not perform differently, as defined by a predetermined margin, from the standard assay
      performed on NP and other respiratory samples

        The population will be comprised of individuals age 18 years or older who are willing and
        able to provide verbal consent to provide a saliva sample AND a NP swab. The number of
        participants required is estimated to be 300 individuals whose infection status is unknown
        or 50 infection positive individuals and 50 infection negative individuals. The population
        will generally be symptomatic for, or at high risk of COVID-19 disease by criteria set
        forth in local testing sites. In addition, investigators will collect paired NP swabs and
        saliva from an equivalent size cohort of individuals known or suspected to NOT be infected
        with SARS-CoV-2.
