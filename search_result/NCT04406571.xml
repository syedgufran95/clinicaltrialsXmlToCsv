  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic adenocarcinoma will be the 2nd cause of death by cancer in Europe in 2030.
      Pancreatic adenocarcinoma has poor prognosis with an all-stages combined 5-year survival rate
      below 8%.

      Since December 2019, a new coronavirus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2,
      SARS-CoV-2) is responsible of COVID-19 infection with potentially severe respiratory syndrome
      or even multi-organ failure. An increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection in cancer
      patients is suggested in several Chinese series. Cancer care structures quickly reorganized
      to limit high-risk situations (diagnostic procedure, major surgery, cytotoxic
      poly-chemotherapy) and use alternatives such as on-hold chemotherapy. These reorganizations
      could be associated with a loss of chance for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
