  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the study is to determine the therapeutic effect and tolerance of
      Sarilumab in patients with moderate, severe pneumonia or critical pneumonia associated with
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Sarilumab is a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds
      specifically to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6Rs (sIL-6Rα and mIL-6Rα) and has been
      shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling through these receptors. The study has a cohort
      multiple Randomized Controlled Trials (cmRCT) design. Randomization will occur prior to
      offering Sarilumab administration to patients enrolled in the CORIMUNO-19 cohort. Sarilumab
      will be administered to consenting adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 either diagnosed
      with moderate or severe pneumonia requiring no mechanical ventilation or critical pneumonia
      requiring mechanical ventilation. Patients who will chose not to receive Sarilumab will
      receive standard of care. Outcomes of Sarilumab-treated patients will be compared with
      outcomes of standard of care-treated patients as well as with outcomes of patients treated
      with other immune modulators.
