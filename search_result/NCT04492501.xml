  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beyond supportive care, there are currently no proven treatment options for coronavirus
      disease (COVID-19) and related pneumonia, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
      Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Investigators have seen recently from experience in Western
      countries with best health care systems that pandemics cannot be managed in hospitals.
      Investigators have seen ICUs crowded to capacity, healthcare workers being exposed and going
      to quarantine or dying after exposure to large doses of viral inoculums. Investigators
      recommend that institutions should register for Clinical trials and consider emergency use of
      TPE. In Pandemics, time is of essence to avoid mortality by intervening early with available
      evidence, preferably as part of clinical trial.Since the outbreak of corona virus disease
      (COVID-19), main treatment modalities have been antivirals, interferons, glucocorticoids,
      anti-coagulants and supportive treatment in addition to traditional Chinese medicine. There
      are also clinical trials exploring hydroxyquinoline / chloroquine sulphate, azithromycin,
      immunoglobulins, Vitamin-C, washed microbiota, nebulized interferon, teicoplanin as well as
      Mesenchymal stem cells. However, most of these trials were small and remain in the
      experimental phase with currently no effective / speciﬁc antiviral with robust scientific
      evidence as regards the mortality reduction in COVID-19.In an attempt to treat COVID-19,
      investigator will use different investigational treatment either alone or in combination to
      see mortality and morbidity benefit on the basis of limitted evidence available so far. These
      investigational modalities include Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE), Convalescent Plasma
      (CP), Remdesivir, Tocilizumab and Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy in addition to standard
      supportive treatment.

      Mesenchymal stem cell therapy in combination with other investigational treatments in
      addition to standard treatment Operational Definitions

        1. Moderate disease:

           COVID-19 positive case with lung infiltrates &lt; 50% of total lung fields on Chest X-ray /
           peripheral ground glass opacities (GGOs) on High Resolution Computerized Tomography
           (HRCT)chest but no evidence of hypoxemia.

        2. Severe disease:

           COVID-19 pneumonia with evidence of hypoxemia (RR &gt; 30/minute or PaO2 on ABGs &lt; 80mmHg
           or PaO2/FiO2 (PF ratio) &lt; 300 or lung infiltrates &gt; 50% of the lung field).

        3. Critical illness:

           COVID-19 pneumonia with evidence of either respiratory failure (PaO2 &lt; 60mmHg) or
           multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) measured by Sequential Organ Failure assessment
           (SOFA score) &gt; 10 or septic shock (Systolic BP less than 90 or less than 40mm Hg of
           baseline in hypertensive or Urine output &lt; 0.5 ml/kg/hour).Age, sex, comorbidities, date

      5. Standard treatment: As per Institutional COVID-19 Management Guidelines all patients of
      moderate, severe and critical COVID-19 received standard protocol of aspirin,
      anticoagulation, ulcer prophylaxis, awake Proning (if PaO2 &lt; 80mmHg) and corticosteroids. All
      patients of CRS received Methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg irrespective of disease severity. 6.
      Therapeutic Plasma exchange (TPE) Therapeutic plasma exchange: 1-1.5 plasma exchange daily
      (1-5 sessions) with replacement fluid Fresh frozen Plasma (FFP) (whole volume) to 70 willing
      patients of moderate, severe and critical disease with evidence of CRS after explaining the
      investigational role of this therapy. TPE will be given in addition to standard treatment to
      70 patients randomly. TPE related complications to be documented 7. Recovery Recovery to be
      defined by de-escalation of patients condition from severe to moderate, or from moderate to

About 50ml bone marrow will be collected from iliac crest using aseptic technique in syringes primed with anticoagulant. The collected sample will be diluted with Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) and MSCs will be separated using density gradient centrifugation. After resuspension the cells will be seeded at a fixed concentration of 100,000 cells/cm2 in specially designed flasks and incubated at 37Oc in 5% CO2. Medium will be changed after every third day till harvesting of MSCs from the flasks. Once confluent (approximately day 20) the cells will be harvested with sterile techniques using Trypsin- EDTA solution.</description>
