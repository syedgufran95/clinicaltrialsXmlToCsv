  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current Sars-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has created major changes in how physicians
      perform routine healthcare for our patients, including elective and non-elective surgical
      procedures. Beginning on March 16th, 2020 Northwell Health postponed all elective surgeries.
      As the incidence of COVID-19 cases begins to decrease and hospital volume improves we need to
      ensure the safety of our patients planning surgical procedures. However, at this time there
      is a scarcity of data regarding the COVID-19 test conversion rate in surgical patients. Our
      goal is to determine the COVID-19 test conversion rate in these patients to better guide
      strategies for restarting surgical care in a large-scale pandemic.

      Patients will be routinely tested with serology and PCR for COVID-19 24-48 hours prior to
      their scheduled surgery. Those who provide informed consent will be re-tested 12-16 days
      after discharge from the hospital to determine any potential nosocomial infection rate.
      Patients will also answer a few questions during their retest to allow the study team to
      gauge exposure risk postoperatively after leaving the hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rapid spread of the COVID-19 infection has led to a near global lockdown including a
      pause in all elective surgeries [1-6]. Multiple healthcare systems and surgical societies
      recommended ceasing all elective procedures until this crisis is contained [7-10]. As such,
      it will be necessary for hospitals to restructure as surgeries increase to protect surgical
      patients from becoming infected. Our study will be the first to define the test conversion
      rate of those undergoing surgical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. The information
      gathered from this study can have implications in how surgical centers treat patients during
      and after this pandemic.

      There has been a single study examining postoperative nosocomial infections during the
      initial incubation period in which 100% of patients developed Sars-CoV-2 viral pneumonia, 14
      (44%) required ICU admission with mechanical ventilation, and 7 (20.5%) died after ICU
      admission [11]. A second cohort of bariatric surgery patients found that 4 of 4 (100%)
      developed Sars-CoV-2 infections postoperatively with all patients surviving [12]. Another
      retrospective study found that of 305 patients admitted to the digestive surgery service, 15
      (4.9%) developed nosocomial Sars-CoV-2 pneumonia [13]. Of this cohort, two patients died, and
      seven were hospitalized with six discharged at the time of chart review. Another
      retrospective non-operative hospital cohort found that 34 of 102 adult patients contracted
      Sars-CoV-2 as a nosocomial infection. In a review of Gynecologic Oncology procedures in Wuhan
      the overall nosocomial infection rate was 1.59% (3/189) with two of the three patients being
      discharged by the publication date [14]. However, in a retrospective review of a general
      hospital ward in Hong Kong in which the staff used 'vigilant basic infection control
      measures' 10 patients and 7 staff members that met the definition for close contact were
      identified and through contact tracing 76 tests were performed on 52 contacts with no
      Sars-CoV-2 infections identified [15]. Another cohort from Wuhan demonstrated that when
      performing regional anesthesia (45/49 for Cesarean Section), no anesthetists were infected
      when complying with level 3 PPE [16].

If they consent, they will provide signed informed consent and will receive testing with serology and PCR for COVID-19 infection at pre-surgical testing 24-48 hours prior to their scheduled procedure. If they consent while inpatient postoperatively, signed informed consent will be procured after they have completed their pre-operative COVID-19 testing. PCR for COVID entails obtaining a nasopharyngeal swab to determine whether there is active viral replication and viral shedding. They will then have a second test with serology and PCR for COVID-19 infection 12-16 days after discharge from the hospital.</description>

    <description>PCR for COVID entails obtaining a nasopharyngeal swab (a cotton tip introduced via the nose to obtain a sample) to determine whether there is active viral replication and viral shedding. They will then have a second test with serology and PCR for COVID-19 infection 12-16 days after discharge from the hospital. Serology implies that a blood sample will be obtained by venipuncture.
