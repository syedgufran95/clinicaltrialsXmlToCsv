  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In severe COVID-19 pulmonary failure, the profound hypoxemia is mainly related to pulmonary
      vasodilation with altered hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). Besides prone
      positioning, other non-ventilatory strategies may reduce the intrapulmonary shunt. This study
      has investigated almitrine, a pharmacological option used in standard care to improve
      oxygenation.

      A case control series of mechanically ventilated confirmed COVID-19 patients was recorded.

      At stable ventilatory settings, consecutive patients received two doses of almitrine (4 and
      12 mcg/kg/min) at 30-45 min interval each, and were compared to 7 &quot;control&quot; COVID-matched
      patients conventionally treated.

      The end-point was the reduction of intra-pulmonary shunt, with an increase in partial
      pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) and central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2).

      The clinical presentation of COVID-19 disease is heterogenous, ranging from no symptoms to
      severe acute respiratory failure (ARF), which may have a poor prognosis. A severe hypoxemia
      is associated with preserved respiratory mechanical properties, in particular the pulmonary
      system compliance.

      The hypoxia during the early phase seems to mainly result from an important
      ventilation/perfusion (VA/Q) mismatch associated with an altered pulmonary vasoconstriction.
      The &quot;protective&quot; mechanism called hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) normally reduces
      the blood flow in poorly or non-ventilated areas towards aerated zones leading to reduce the
      (VA/Q) mismatch. HPV seems poorly functional in COVID-19 severe patients in absence of &quot;cor
      pulmonale&quot;.

      According to the French National agency for Drug Security (ANSM, Paris, France), only iv
      almitrine is indicated for hypoxic acute respiratory failure as Drug of Major Therapeutic
      Interest. This molecule is a routine option in the treatment strategy of severe hypoxemia.

      The investigators studied COVID-19 patients mechanically ventilated at FiO2 1 with a severe
      intrapulmonary shunt during their early phase. The emergency conditions and the acute high
      inflow of patients to ICU impeded the design of a randomized control trial. To eliminate the
      eventuality of a spontaneous evolution of hypoxia, these patients will be compared with
      control-matched COVID patients treated conventionally.

        Between March16 and April 20, 2020, COVID-19 patients referred to ICU age, gender, BMI, Hb
        The recorded parameters were: the ventilatory settings unchanged along the protocol,
        including FiO2, PEEP level, tidal volume (VT), peak inspiratory pressure, plateau pressure;
        haemoglobin concentration, blood gases simultaneously sampled on the arterial catheter and
        on the central catheter to assess central venous oxygen saturation SvcO2, and arterial
        lactate, right atrial pressure; cardiac output when possible (Mostcare®, Vygon, Ecouen,
