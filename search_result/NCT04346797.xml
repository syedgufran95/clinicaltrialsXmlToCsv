  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the study is to determine the therapeutic effect and tolerance of
      Eculizumab in patients with moderate, severe pneumonia or critical pneumonia associated with
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Eculizumab is a terminal complement inhibitor that has
      been investigated for more than 10 years in numerous complement-mediated diseases. The study
      has a cohort multiple Randomized Controlled Trials (cmRCT) design. Randomization will occur
      prior to offering Eculizumab administration to patients enrolled in the CORIMUNO-19 cohort.
      Eculizumab will be administered to consenting adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19
      either diagnosed with moderate or severe pneumonia requiring no mechanical ventilation or
      critical pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation. Patients who will chose not to receive
      Eculizumab will receive standard of care. Outcomes of Eculizumab-treated patients will be
      compared with outcomes of standard of care-treated patients as well as with outcomes of
      patients treated with other immune modulators.
