  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients are part of a family network. When any person in a family becomes critically unwell
      and requires the assistance of an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), this has an impact on all
      members of that family.

      COVID-19 changed visiting for all patients in hospitals across Scotland. It is not known what
      effect these restrictions will have on patients' recovery, nor do we understand the impact it
      may have on their relatives or staff caring for them. This study will look at the
      implications of the visiting restrictions as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic upon
      patients without COVID-19 who are in the cardiothoracic ICU. It will also explore the impact
      of these restrictions on them, their relatives and staff.

      This study will be carried out within a single specialised intensive care unit in Scotland
      using mixed methods.

      The first arm of this study will use retrospective data that is routinely collected in normal
      clinical practice. The investigators will compare patient outcomes prior to COVID-19 with
      outcomes following the implementation of COVID-19 visiting restrictions. The aim is to
      establish if the restrictions on visiting has an impact on the duration of delirium. Delirium
      is an acute mental confusion and is associated with longer hospital stays and worse outcomes
      in this patient group.

      The second arm of this study involves semi-structured interviews with patients, relatives and
      staff that will allow deeper exploration of the issues around current visiting policy. The
      interviews will last approximately 1 hour and will address these issues. They will then be
      transcribed word for word and analysed using grounded theory, meaning the theories will
      develop from the data as it is analysed.

      This study will look at the implications of visiting restrictions on patients without
      COVID-19 who are in the intensive care unit. It will also explore the impact of these
      restrictions on them, their relatives and staff.

      The investigators hypothesise that the restriction of visiting has a negative impact on
      recovery of patients, families of patients and staff caring for patients without COVID-19 in
      the cardiothoracic ICU.

      In order to answer this hypothesis, the wider implications of COVID-19 will be explored, not
      only with patients, but also relatives and staff involved in the care of these patients.

      The research questions this study aims to answer are:

        1. Is there a negative impact on the clinical outcomes due to the COVID-19 visitation
           restrictions?

        2. Is there an increase in the incidence and duration of delirium in patients who do not
           receive visitors?

        3. What experiences do patients recall during their ICU admission through the COVID-19
           pandemic visitation restrictions?

        4. What experiences do relatives recall from their loved-ones during an ICU admission
           during the COVID-19 pandemic visitation restrictions?

        5. What impact, if any, do the changes to visiting have on staff?

      In order to answer these research questions the investigators will carry out a single centre
      mixed method observational study. This study will consist of two arms.

      The first arm of this study will utilise retrospective data that is routinely collected in
      normal clinical practice in this single centre. This will be used to compare to patient
      outcomes prior to COVID-19 with outcomes following the implementation of COVID-19 visiting
      restrictions.

      The second arm of this study involves semi-structured interviews with patients, relatives and
      staff that allow deeper exploration of the issues around current visiting policy.

    <description>Visitation to patients in hospitals in Scotland was ceased due to the COVID 19 pandemic. Slow reintroduction of visitors has been introduced, however not to the pre COVID 19 levels. This study will examine the effects of these restrictions on patients in the cardiothoracic critical care unit that do not suffer from COVID 19.</description>

        The patient population of this unit comprises of adults undergoing cardiac or thoracic
        surgical procedures, the majority of which are elective operations. Other patients who
        receive care on this unit routinely are patients requiring level 3 care following out of
        hospital cardiac arrest or requiring therapies for advanced heart failure.
