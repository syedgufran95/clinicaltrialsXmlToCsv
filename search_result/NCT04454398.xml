      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety,
      pharmacokinetics and efficacy of a single dose of STI-1499 (COVI-GUARD™), a COVID-19
      targeting monoclonal antibody, in hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19. Four dose
      levels will be tested: 10 mg, 30 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of moderate COVID-19, diagnosed standard RT-PCR assay or equivalent testing

          -  Willing and able to comply with study procedures and follow-up visits

          -  Subject or family member/caregiver must have provided written informed consent which
             includes signing the institutional review board approved consent form prior to
             participating in any study related activity. However, if obtaining written informed
             consent is not possible, other procedures as provided in the March 27th, 2020 FDA
             Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during COVID-19 Pandemic,
             Question 10, may be used.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical signs indicative of severe COVID-19

          -  Rapidly progressive COVID-19 which is likely to progress to &quot;severe&quot; within 24 hours

          -  Documented infection other than COVID-19

          -  Any medical condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, could adversely impact
             safety

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  Has participated, or is participating, in a clinical research study evaluating
             COVID-19 convalescent plasma, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against SARS-CoV-2, or
             intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) within 3 months or less than 5 half-lives of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer) prior to the screening visit. Note:
             Participants who have been prescribed hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or
             without azithromycin or other approved products for the off-label treatment of
             COVID-19 prior to study enrollment may be included and may continue to receive these
             agents so long as the dose remains stable. Additionally, any approved or authorized
             treatment (e.g., remdesivir, dexamethasone or treatments approved under an Emergency
             Use Authorization) is allowed.
