  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind, two arms, placebo controlled, clinical trial to study to
      evaluate the the safety and efficacy of Mycobacterium w in combination with standard of care
      versus placebo with standard of care for preventing the progression of COVID-19 disease and
      for reduction in transfer to ICU in COVID-19 infected patients admitted to the hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total 480 hospitalized adult eligible patients will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive
      either Mw+SOC or placebo+SOC for first 3 days post-randomization.

      Daily clinical evaluation of patient will be performed till discharge from hospital or till
      ICU admission.

      Study duration for each patient will be approximately up to 28 days, or discharge from
      hospital or transfer to ICU, whichever is earlier.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  COVID-19 positive patients with ordinal scale score of 3.

          -  Patients of either gender, age ≥ 18 years at the time of enrollment.

          -  Female patients who are currently using reliable methods of contraception (barrier
             methods and intrauterine contraceptive device), with a negative urine pregnancy test
             during screening and agree to informed compliance of contraceptive method until at
             least 3 months post-dosing.

          -  The patients must be able and willing to comply with the study protocol, available and
             willing to complete all the study assessments and must have signed an Informed Consent
             Form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with ordinal scale of ≥4 at the time of hospital admission and randomization.

          -  Pregnant and / or lactating female patients.

          -  A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.

          -  Any disease condition requiring ICU admission.

          -  History of dialysis, silicosis, solid organ transplantation such as renal or cardiac
             transplants, and disorders of the heart, or nervous system, or other metabolic
             inflammatory conditions, psychiatric, occupational problems that make it unlikely that
             the patients will comply with the protocol as determined by the investigator.

          -  History of administration of any immunoglobulins, any immunotherapy (antineoplastic
             chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunosuppressants to induce tolerance to
             transplants, and corticosteroids use) and/or any blood products within the 3 months
             preceding study dosing, or planned future administrations during the study period.

          -  History of allergic reactions or anaphylaxis to Mw or its component.

          -  Presence of any severe systemic/autoimmune disorders as determined by medical history
             and/or physical examination at the time of screening, which in the judgment of the
             Investigator would compromise the patient's health or is likely to result
             nonconformance to the protocol or a patient's ability to give written informed
             consent.
