    <textblock>
      Convalescent Plasma for COVID-19 Research (CONCOR-Donor) study, is a national, natural
      history study of plasma donors recovered from COVID-19. CONCOR-Donor study will address
      immune response, duration of protective immunity, and clinical factors and host genetics
      contributing to the variability of immune response. We will also study long-term outcomes
      from COVID-19 infection. Results from the study will help define therapeutic strategies for
      COVID-19.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The outbreak caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) led to
      the global pandemic. There are currently no proven treatments for coronavirus disease
      (COVID-19), however, convalescent plasma has emerged as a potential therapeutic to prevent
      clinical deterioration. Convalescent plasma was successfully used for other infections, in
      small numbers, but there is limited evidence for the efficacy of administering specific,
      neutralizing antibodies by transfusion of convalescent plasma. The unknown role for
      convalescent plasma in treating COVID-19 necessitates further study.

      As trials are underway to determine efficacy of using convalescent plasma, we will use this
      unique opportunity to conduct a national longitudinal cohort study of 1000 persons recovered
      from COVID-19 and volunteer to donate convalescent plasma. Our aims are to:1) determine if
      the variability of titers of viral neutralizing antibody and ELISA antibody are associated
      with clinical and demographic factors; 2) determine duration of protective immunity in
      recovered persons over 1 year and if modified by clinical and demographic factors; 3)
      determine genetic risk predictors of the antibody response, and 4) create a biorepository
      available to researchers from across Canada. Based on the World Health Organization (WHO)
      Coordinated Global Research Map, this project addresses the priority of the natural history
      of COVID-19 and clinical characterization of antibody response in the convalescent phase and
      beyond.
