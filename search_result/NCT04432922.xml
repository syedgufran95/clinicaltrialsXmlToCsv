  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to analyze the perceptions, representations and experiences of
      septic isolation of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection.

      This analysis could lead to better understanding and communication between the medical
      profession and patients in septic isolation in hospital. It would also provide
      patient-specific responses to their expectations, as to their families.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SARS-Cov2 is a new virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time, it was
      observed in Wuhan, China in December 2019. For this previously unknown contagious disease,
      which can cause severe respiratory infections, isolation precautions in hospitals and public
      places are one of the cornerstones for fighting this pandemic.

      Hospital isolation precautions have been present since the 19th century as a means to control
      the spread of infections. Septic isolation includes contact isolation, droplets and air.
      Isolation precautions must be prescribed by a physician. To our knowledge, there are few
      studies about the impact of septic isolation on hospitalized patients at both the
      psychological level and the relationship with doctors.

      This study could enable a better understanding and communication between the medical
      profession and patients in septic isolation during hospitalization. It could also provide
      patient-specific responses to their expectations.
