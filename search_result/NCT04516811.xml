      Full Title: A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, phase III clinical
      trial of the therapeutic use of convalescent plasma in the treatment of patients with
      moderate to severe COVID-19.

      Short Title: PROTECT-Patient study

      Aim: Assess the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) as a therapeutic
      treatment for hospitalised patients with moderate to severe COVID-19

      Study Design: Randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase III clinical trial

      Intervention: Randomised 1:1 to either CCP plus standard of care (SOC) or to SOC plus placebo
      (200 mL normal saline)

      Active Agent: A single unit of approximately 200-250 mL of CCP that contains anti-SARS-CoV-2
      collected by plasmapheresis from a volunteer who recovered from COVID19 with SOC as
      determined by local practice and guidelines.

      Placebo: A single unit of 200 mL normal saline with SOC as determined by local practice and
      guidelines

      Sample Size: 600

      Study Population: Consenting adult inpatients with moderate to severe COVID-19, not requiring
      invasive ventilation, who are admitted to a participating public or private sector hospital
      and who are not enrolled in another COVID-19 treatment trial.

      Settings: Participating public and private sector hospitals in South Africa

    <intervention_model_description>Participant identification numbers (PIN), assigned at the screening/enrolment visit, will be used throughout the study. After signing the informed consent document, eligible participants will be randomised to one of the treatment arms, stratified by study site, age group (&lt;=65; &gt;65 years old) and body mass index (BMI) (&lt;30; &gt;=30 kg/m2). An electronic randomisation application will generate the treatment allocation.

    <masking_description>Neither participants nor the investigators will be aware of the participant's treatment allocation until the end of the study (double blinding).
