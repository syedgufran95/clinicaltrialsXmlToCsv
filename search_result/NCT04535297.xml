    <textblock>
      The study aimed at describing the effects of the COVID-19 social distancing on function,
      health and well-being of patients with Parkinson's disease or post-stroke, and test the
      association between the patient activation level and these effects.An anonymous survey was
      distributed through social media and patient associations.Community-living patients with
      Parkinson's disease or post-stroke were invited to answer the survey.

    <textblock>
      People with chronic diseases like Parkinson's disease or post-stroke rely on routine medical
      and rehabilitative care to maintain daily function and health. These are important aspects of
      self-management. However, this was challenged by the social distancing due to COVID-19, which
      limited participation in regular routines.

      The study objectives were: To (1) describe the effects of the COVID-19 social distancing on
      function, health and well-being of patients with Parkinson's disease or post-stroke, and (2)
      test the association between the patient activation level and these effects.

      Community-living patients with Parkinson's disease or post-stroke were invited to answer an
      anonymous survey through social media and patient associations. Part 1 included 27
      multiple-choice questions regarding current status and changes in function, health, medical
      care and well-being. Part 2 consisted of the Patient Activation Measure, describing people's
      knowledge, skill, and confidence in managing their own health.

    <description>The PAM is a self-reported validated, licensed tool to measure a patient's knowledge, skills and confidence for self-management. The overall score captures the extent to which people feel engaged and confident in taking care of their health condition. It consists of 13 statements rated on a Likert scale according to agreement. Scores are divided into 4 levels, where 1 represents patients who tend to be passive and feel overwhelmed managing their own health, and 4 represents patients who have effectively adopted self-management behaviors. We used a validated licensed Hebrew and version of the PAM supplied by Insignia Health (https://www.insigniahealth.com/products/pam-survey), which holds the copyright to the questionnaire.</description>
