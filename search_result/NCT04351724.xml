    <textblock>
      The Austrian Coronavirus Adaptive Clinical Trial (ACOVACT) is a randomized, controlled,
      multicenter, open-label basket trial that aims to compare various antiviral treatments for
      COVID-19. Moreover three substudies have been integrated. Currently, patients will be
      randomized to receive (hydroxy-)chloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir or standard of care.
      Moreover, these patients are eligible for substudy A (randomized to rivaroxaban 5mg 1-0-1 vs.
      standard of care), substudy B (renin-angiotensin (RAS) blockade vs. no RAS blockade for
      patients with blood pressure &gt;120/80mmHg), and substudy C (clazakizumab vs standard of care,
      for patients with respiratory deterioration and high inflammatory biomarkers).

      Endpoints were chosen based on the master protocol published by the World Health Organisation
      and include a 7-point scale of clinical performance, mortality, oxygen requirement (both dose
      and type), duration of hospitalization, viral load and safety.

    <description>The primary endpoint is time to clinical improvement which is defined as time from randomization to an (sustained) improvement of at least one category on two consecutive days compared to the status at randomization measured on a seven-category ordinal scale (proposed by WHO).
The 7-categories of the World Health Organization proposed scale, as follows:
Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities
Not hospitalized, limitation on activities;
Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen;
Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen;
Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices;
Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO;
Death.
During hospitalization this score will be determined daily (till day 29). If a patient is released from the hospital before day 29, the score will be determined at day 11 and 29 after randomization (depending when the patient was released or by telephone call).</description>
