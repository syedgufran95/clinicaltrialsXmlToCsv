    <textblock>
      The PATCH trial (Prevention And Treatment of COVID-19 with Hydroxychloroquine) is funded
      investigator-initiated trial that includes 3 cohorts. Cohort 1: a double-blind placebo
      controlled trial of high dose HCQ as a treatment for home bound COVID-19 positive patients;
      Cohort 2: a randomized study testing different doses of HCQ in hospitalized patients; Cohort
      3: a double blind placebo controlled trial of low dose HCQ as a preventative medicine in
      health care workers.
