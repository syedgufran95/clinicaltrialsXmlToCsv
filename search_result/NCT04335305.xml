      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy -as determined by the proportion of patients
      with normalization of SpO2 ≥96% on room air- of continued standard care together with
      tocilizumab plus pembrolizumab (MK- 3475) in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia

         10. Bowel diverticulitis or perforation.

         11. Diagnosis of immunodeficiency receiving immunosuppressive therapy within seven days
             prior to study treatment initiation. Active autoimmune disease that has required
             systemic treatment in past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents,
             corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs).

         12. Current known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus
             (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV). Patients with past HBV infection or resolved HBV
             infection (defined as having a negative hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] test and a
             positive hepatitis B core antibody [HBcAb] test, accompanied by a negative HBV DNA
             test) are eligible. Patients positive for HCV antibody are eligible only if PCR test
             is negative for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA).

         13. Vaccination with any live virus vaccine within 28 days prior to study treatment

             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza
             vaccines (e.g., FluMist®) are live-attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.

         14. History of prior allogeneic bone marrow, stem-cell, or solid organ transplantation.

         15. Patients have any other concurrent severe medical condition that would, in the
             Investigator's judgment contraindicate patient participation in the clinical study.

         16. Pregnant women, lactating women and planned pregnant women.
