  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This retrospective study aims to perform a medication risk stratification using drug claims
      data and to simulate the impact of the addition of various repurposed drugs on the Medication
      Risk Score (MRS) in a health insurance population. Our clinical tool would enable us to
      identify potential multi-drug interactions and potentially reduce the risk of adverse drug
      events (ADE) developing in these patients infected with COVID-19.

      Certain investigational agents have been described in observational series or are being used
      anecdotally based on in vitro or extrapolated evidence. It is important to acknowledge that
      there are no controlled data supporting the use of any of these agents, and their efficacy
      for COVID-19 is unknown. FDA-approved drugs such as chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine,
      lopinavir/ritonavir, monoclonal IL-6 antibodies, JAK inhibitors, thalidomide, and the new
      investigational drug remdesivir, have been proposed for repurposing to fight COVID-19 and its
      complications.

      A medication risk stratification strategy will be used to simulate the impacts of different
      potential repurposed drugs for COVID-19 and the Medication Risk Score (MRS) which is used as
      a predictive tool for ADEs. A retrospective study will be conducted using de-identified drug
      claims data for commercially insured patients.
