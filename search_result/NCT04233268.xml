  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower Respiratory Tract infections are a common cause of admission to the intensive care
      unit. Children routinely receive antibiotics until the tests confirm whether the infection is
      bacterial or viral. The exclusion of bacterial infection may take 48 hours or longer for
      culture tests on biological samples to be completed. In many cases, the results may be
      inconclusive or negative if the patient has already received antibiotics prior to the sample
      being taken.

      A rapid assay to detect the most likely cause of infection could improve the speed with which
      antibiotic therapy is rationalised or curtailed.

      This study aims to assess whether a new genetic testing kit which can identify the presence
      of bacteria and viruses within hours rather than days is a feasible tool in improving
      antibiotic prescribing and rationalisation of therapy in critically ill children with
      suspected lower respiratory tract infection.
