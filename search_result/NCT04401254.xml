  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are critically ill with COVID-19 requiring life support in an intensive care
      unit (ICU) have increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Currently the ICU community does
      not know what effect the disease, the ICU admission, physiotherapy interventions and life
      support have on their long-term quality of life and whether they can return to their
      pre-illness level of function following ICU.

      COVID-Recovery will describe the physiotherapy interventions delivered to critically ill
      patients with COVID-19. In survivors, COVID-Recovery will utilise telephone follow-up of ICU
      survivors to assess disability-free survival and quality of life at 3 and 6 months after ICU
      admission. Additionally, COVID-Recovery will identify if there are predictors of
      disability-free survival. COVID-Recovery will aim to select up to 300 patients diagnosed with
      COVID-19 from ICUs in Australia. If they survive to hospital discharge, patients will be
      invited to receive a telephone questionnaire at 3 and 6 months after the ICU admission that
      aims to assess their long-term outcomes, including physical, cognitive and emotional
      function, quality of life, and whether they have been able to return to work following ICU
      discharge.

      COVID-Recovery will also aim to investigate the human aspect of COVID-19 by further
      investigating a sub-set of patients. COVID-Recovery will recruit between 15-30 of these
      patients and a family member, so COVID-Recovery can explore the patient experience of being
      admitted to the ICU and treated for COVID-19, as well as illuminate and explore the
      experience of having a close relative admitted and treated for COVID-19.
