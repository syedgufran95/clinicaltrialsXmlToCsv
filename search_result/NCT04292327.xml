      Objects: The purpose of this study was to observe the characteristics of morbidity, disease
      progression and therapeutic effects of 2019-novel coronavirus pneumonia patients with
      different clinical types.

      Method: A single center, retrospective and observational study was used to collect COVID-19
      patients admitted to Wuhan Infectious Diseases Hospital (Wuhan JinYinTan Hospital) from
      January 2020 to March 2020. The general information, first clinical symptoms, hospitalization
      days, laboratory examination, CT examination, antiviral drugs, immune enhancers, traditional
      Chinese medicine treatment and other clinical intervention measures were recorded, and the
      nutritional status and prognosis of the patients were recorded. confirm COVID-19 's disease
      progression, clinical characteristics, disease severity and treatment effects. To compare the
      characteristics of disease progression, clinical features, disease severity and therapeutic
      effect of different types of COVID-19.

      Outcomes: The characteristics of disease progression, clinical features, disease severity and
      therapeutic effect of different types of COVID-19.

      Conclusion: The characteristics of disease progression, clinical features and therapeutic
      effect of different types of COVID-19.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since December 2019, patients with unexplained pneumonia have appeared in some medical
      institutions in Wuhan, China. Nucleic acid testing was completed on January 10, 2020, which
      was confirmed to be caused by 2019-novel coronavirus. In 2020, the World Health
      Organization(WHO) named the virus 2019-novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV). The WHO announced that
      the pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV is officially called COVID-19. Today, more than 70,000
      cases have been confirmed and more than 2,000 patients have died.

      At present, the epidemiological characteristics, laboratory indicators, imaging features and
      clinical treatment effects of COVID-19 should be reported, but the sample size is small.
      Large sample studies are still needed to further confirm COVID-19 's disease progression,
      clinical characteristics, disease severity and treatment effects, so as to provide a
      scientific basis for future clinical treatment. Therefore, it is particularly important to
      further review the relationship between the characteristics and prognosis of such patients.
