  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pandemic, which started in China at the end of 2019, appeared in our country in a short
      time. Most hospitals and physicians were only concerned with the treatment of these patients.
      One of the most victimized patient groups in this duration was lymphedema patients who were
      in need of continuous follow-up and rehabilitation at necessary periods, but were also at
      risk in terms of covid-19 infection and could not go to hospitals unless necessary. The
      treatment of both primary and secondary lymphedema patients has been interrupted or delayed.
      This process has affected the health status, treatment processes and quality of life of the
      lymphedema patient group. The current situation may have caused them anxiety and depression
      as a result of infection fear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the treatment processes,
      health status, coronavirus phobia, anxiety, and depression states of the lymphedema patients
      .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      60 primary and secondary lymphedema male and female patients with stage I,II,III lymphedema
      older than 18 years old over who were followed up in the lymphedema outpatient clinic of the
      Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinic were included in the study.They were called by
      phone. Permission was asked for questioning from the patients reached. A hundred lymphedema
      patients were called and 60 patients were reached or agreed to be interviewed. The questions
      on the form and scales were read clearly to the patients who accepted the interview and were
      asked to be answered by the patient. The health status of the admitted patients during the
      covid-19 pandemic period and the treatment processes were questioned with the form we
      prepared.These forms were included socio-demographic features, physical, and detailed medical
      histories.Edema staging was evaluated by the International Society of Lymphology (ISL)
      lymphedema staging classification.This information was filled in from patients' files. The
      pandemic process was evaluated in the other part of the form. Working status, mobilization
      during the pandemic process, whether he/she or his/her relative was diagnosed with
      coronavirus infection, whether he/she received suplemental treatment, how much he/she paid
      attention to hand-foot hygine, whether his/her swelling increased, whether he/she had a
      cellulite attack, whether he/she regular self-manual lymphatic drainage and/or exercise, It
      was questioned whether there was an increase in a different symptom other than swelling,
      eating habits and weight gain, most recently whether he used pressure stocking regularly.In
      addition, the fear because of the covid-19 virus was questioned with the coronavirus-19
      phobia scale (CP19-S), quality of life with lymphedema quality of life arm / leg (LYMQOL),
      and anxiety and depression with the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS).

    <measure>Coronavirus Phobia Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The CP19-S has 20 items which is a self-report instrument with a five-point Likert-type scale to assess the levels of coronavirus (covid-19) phobia. All items are rated on a 5 point scale from &quot;strongly disagree (1)&quot; to &quot;strongly agree (5).&quot; The scores on the scale can range between 20 and 100 and a higher score indicates a greater phobia in the respected subscales (psychological, psycho-somatic, economic and social) and total scale. In the present study total scale scores ranged from 20 to 100 .</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Lymphedema Quality of Life Arm</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The LYMQOL-Arm consists of four domains with 28 items. These domains are symptoms, appearance, function, and mood. The answers were evaluated on a four-point Likert scale (1= not at all 2= a little, 3= quite a bit, 4= a lot). Each item received a score between 1 and 4, with higher scores indicating a worse QOL. Domain totals were calculated by adding the individual scores and dividing the total by the number of questions answered (If &gt;50% of questions per domain were not answered this cannot be calculated *and =0). If the item was not scored and left blank or not applicable, this was scored with a 0. The four domains and their corresponding questions are: Function 1 (a-h), 2,3, Appearance 4,5,6,7,8 Symptoms 9,10,11,12,13,14 and Emotion 15,16,17,18,19,20. Overall QOL (Q21) is scored as the value marked by the patient, between 0-10</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Lymphedema Quality of Life Leg</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The LYMQOL-Leg consists of 27 items: 26 multiple-choice questions and 1 rating question. It covers four domains: symptoms, appearance, function, and mood. Scoring and calculating is same with the arm scale but differences are; function 1 (a-f), 2,3 appearance 4,5,6,7,8,9,10 symptoms 11,12,13,14,15 and emotion 16,17,18,19,20,21. Overall quality of life (Q22) is scored as the value marked by the patient, between 0-10.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of 14 items with two subscales (seven items for anxiety and seven items for depression). Each item is scored 0-3. Each subscale is scored between 0 and 21. The aim of the scale is not to make a diagnosis, but to determine the risk group bt screening anxiety and depression in a short time in patients with physical diseases. The cut-off points of the Turkish version of the HADS were determined as 10 for the anxiety subscale and 7 for the depression subscale.</description>
