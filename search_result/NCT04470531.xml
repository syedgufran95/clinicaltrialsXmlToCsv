  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory
      Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Severe disease occurs in 15% of the cases with COVID-19
      and may progress to critical disease in only 5% of the cases with a high risk of mortality.
      Critical disease may present as acute respiratory failure secondary to Acute Respiratory
      Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and is caused by the body's hyper-immune response to the virus in
      the form of a cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). There is currently no effective anti-viral
      treatment against SARS-CoV-2 and the mainstay of treatment is supportive. Co-trimoxazole
      (combination of trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole in a 1:5) ratio is a Sulphur containing
      anti-folate bactericidal antibiotic indicated for the treatment of respiratory tract
      infections. It has been around for over 60 years and is inexpensive and readily available
      with a good safety profile. It has a rapid onset of action with excellent bioavailability and
      lung penetration. In addition to having antimicrobial properties co-trimoxazole have
      immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties and may be a potential treatment option for
      cytokine storm syndrome mediated severe COVID-19.

      This open-label randomized controlled trial will be conducted in the department of medicine
      at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Anwar Khan Modern Medical college and
      Mughda Medical College Hospital (DMCH), Dhaka for a duration of 6 months following approval
      of this protocol. It will recruit at least 94 consecutive adults (18 years or older) patients
      with clinically suspected COVID-19 and severe illness as per WHO criteria. After taking
      informed written consent patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either oral
      co-trimoxazole in addition to standard therapy or standard therapy alone. Baseline
      characteristics, changes in the physiological and biochemical parameters like (SpO2/FiO2
      ratio, respiratory rate, body temperature and C - reactive protein), length of hospital stay,
      side effects of drugs, requirement for ventilatory support (non-invasive and invasive
      ventilation) and in-patient mortality between the two groups will be compared.

      Conclusion If the results from this clinical trial demonstrate the beneficial effects of
      co-trimoxazole in severe COVID-19 patients it could be used widely, thereby reducing the need
      for respiratory support and potentially saving thousands of lives in developing nations with
      limited resources where healthcare may be easily overwhelmed.

    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-COV2, represents a highly transmissible and
      potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern at this moment. The
      pandemic situation in Bangladesh is also evolving rapidly with positive cases and deaths
      increasing each day. Epidemiological changes in COVID-19 infection should be monitored taking
      into account potential routes of transmission and subclinical infections, in addition to the
      adaptation, evolution, and virus spread among humans and possible intermediate animals and
      reservoirs. But till today there is no specific management to deal with this highly deadly
      viral infection. Howeverthere are few drugs which might cause some beneficial effects in the
      recovery of the patient. Cotrimoxazole is a time tested antibiotic which has been in clinical
      use for 60 years with anti-bacterial action against a wide range of organism. In addition to
      the antimicrobial effects, co-trimoxazole has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects.
      Co-trimoxazole has previously been shown to exert anti-cytokine effect by inhibiting
      interleukin 1, 6 (IL-1, IL-6) and Tumour Necrosis Factor α (TNF α) which are the major
      cytokines identified in patients with severe COVID-19. As in some case reports this has shown
      significant clinical improvement in ARDS, so there is a possibility, that cotrimoxazole might
      have also role in improving the clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients especially in moderate
      to severe cases. As till today there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 infections, if
      cotrimoxazole ifs found to be effective this will bring a great benefit to the target
      populations. Beside this, cotrimoxazole is a very cheap drug in comparison to other ones this
      will also be of great economical benefit in taking cares of the general population. As there
      is no such study published about the role of cotrimoxazole in COVID-19 patients, this study
      will generate a new information which bring a great benefit in battling with the COVID-19
      infection.

      Research Question:

      What is the outcome of co-trimoxazole in severe COVID-19 patients?

      Objectives:

      General Objectives To assess the clinical outcome of co-trimoxazolein patients with severe
      COVID-19

      Specific Objectives:

      To assess length of stay who are treated with co-trimoxazole in addition to standard
      treatment versus standard treatment alone.

      throat, unusual bruising or bleeding, yellowing of the skin or eye discolorations, joint or
      muscle pain,red or purple skin.etc) of drugs who are treated with co-trimoxazole in addition
      to standard treatment versus standard treatment alone.

      To find out requirement for ventilator support (non-invasive and invasive ventilation) who
      are treated with co-trimoxazole in addition to standard treatment versus standard treatment
      alone.

      test or Wilcoxon signed rank test for continuous variables and Chi- square test or Fisher's
      exact test for categorical variables. Survival will be assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method.
      Comparisons between two groups will be performed using the log-rank test and Hazard
      regression test.A p-value of &lt; 0.05 will be considered to be significant. The statistical
      software SPSS version 25 will be used for the analysis.
