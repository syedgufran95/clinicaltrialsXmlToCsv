      A prospective cohort minimal risk study to determine the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on
      outcomes of neurologically injured ICU patients.

    <textblock>
      COVID 19 pandemic has overwhelmed healthcare capacity in many regions around the world. As
      resources become more limited and we have to triage /ration ventilators, neurologically
      injured ICU patients without COVID 19 but with respiratory insufficiency may be triaged to no
      ventilator care due to their perceived or actual prognosis. This may lead to increased rates
      of withdrawal of care and mortality. Some neurologically injured ICU patients with
      respiratory insufficiency may be simultaneously infected with COVID 19. Their outcomes are
      completely unknown. Capturing data on the prevalence of limitation of care and prognosis in
      this patient population will provide important information towards ongoing efforts in patient
      care and resource utilization as we face the rapidly evolving COVID 19 pandemic. Given the
      expected strain on ICU resources and limitations in research in ICUs during COVID 19
      pandemic, data capture/study design must be targeted and pragmatic. This study is designed to
      answer the most basic and important questions while minimizing the burden of data collection
      on already overloaded providers.

      This study design is comprised of two components: Component 1- Prospective cohort prevalence
      study captures data related to treatments offered, limitations of care and patient outcome in
      5 select primary neurological diagnoses requiring ICU care. Component 2- Case control study
      captures the same data elements in the same patient populations during the 3 months prior
      COVID 19 pandemic (Sept - Dec, 2019).
