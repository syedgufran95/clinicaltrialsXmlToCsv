  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to recent publications, the percentage of caregivers infected with COVID 19 is
      evaluated between 10 and 30% . This great variability is due, on the one hand to the
      intensity of the influx of covid plus patients and, on the other hand, to the disparity in
      the preparation of caregivers in the face of this emergency. Indeed, we can understand that
      the strict application of hygiene rules can be faulted in the face of the volume of patients,
      the lack of protective equipment and the lack of specific training for caregivers in this
      area. As a result, within healthcare teams, there are many questions that generate anxiety:
      will I be able to provide care properly while protecting myself from the risk of
      contamination? This anxiety is also present and sometimes manifests itself aggressively in
      the entourage or in the vicinity of caregivers, due to lack of scientific data adapted to the
      local ecology of the crisis.

      Thus, the aim of this study is to show that the risk for caregivers of being contaminated by
      COVID in an area dedicated to COVID positive patients is no higher than being a caregiver in
      a non-COVID area that he either in the adult or pediatric sector.
