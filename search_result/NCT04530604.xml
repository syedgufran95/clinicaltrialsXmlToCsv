  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will enroll participants that have pneumonia caused by the COVID-19
      virus. During the study patients will receive 7 to up to 14 days of defibrotide. After
      completing the treatment, participants will have 30 day follow-up check-up to assess for
      adverse events and clinical status. This final assessment can be done virtually, by telephone
      or electronically (email) if the patient cannot be contacted by phone. No in-person visit is
      required.

      The hypothesis of this trial is that defibrotide therapy given to patients with severe
      SARS-CoV2 ARDS will be safe and associated with improved overall survival, within 28 days of
      therapy initiation.

Fatal Bleeding, and/or
Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, such as intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, retroperitoneal, intra-articular, pericardial, or intramuscular with compartment syndrome, and/or
Bleeding associated with a decline in hemoglobin level of &gt; 2.0 g/dl, leading to transfusion of two or more units of whole blood or red cells.
In addition, symptomatic alveolar hemorrhage, macroscopic hematuria, uncontrolled menorrhagia or epistaxis or bleeding from any wound site would also be considered a major hemorrhagic event.</description>

    <description>All patients will receive 25 milligram/kilogram/day (mg/kg/day) of defibrotide, given in 4 divided doses (approximately every 6 hours), each dose infused over 2-hours intravenously (IV).
The planned duration of study therapy is 7 days (while in the hospital), with the following qualifications:
Patients who respond to study therapy prior to day 7 (able to discontinue oxygen) will discontinue study therapy at that earlier time point.
Patients who have not responded to study therapy by day 7 of therapy, evidenced by &lt;20% reduction (or a worsening) of the amount of supplemental oxygen they are receiving, will discontinue study therapy at day 7.
Patients who have evidence of a partial pulmonary response by day 7 (&gt;20% reduction in supplemental oxygen requirement, but still require supplemental oxygen) may elect to continue to receive study drug through an additional 7 days of study (total 14-day therapy course).</description>
