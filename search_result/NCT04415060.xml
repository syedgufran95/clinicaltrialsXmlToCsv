  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients suffering lung failure, possibly from COVID-19 or hypoxic lung failure, will need
      life-saving support from a breathing machine. Any patient needing this support requires drugs
      to keep them sleepy, or &quot;sedated&quot; to be comfortable on this machine. Sedation is made
      possible by using drugs given through a vein. Unfortunately, these drugs are in short supply
      worldwide due to the high number of COVID-19 patients needing these machines.

      Another way to provide sleep is by using gases that are breathed in. These are used every day
      in operating rooms to perform surgery. These gases, also called &quot;inhaled agents&quot; can also be
      used in intensive care units and may have several important benefits for patients and the
      hospital. Research shows they may reduce swelling in the lung and increase oxygen levels,
      which allows patients to recover faster and reduce the time spent on a breathing machine. In
      turn, this allows the breathing machine to be used again for the next sick patient. These
      drugs may also increase the number of patients who live through their illness. Inhaled agents
      are widely available and their use could dramatically lesson the pressure on limited drug
      supplies.

      This research is a study being carried out in a number of hospitals that will compare how
      well patients recover from these illnesses depending on which type of sedation drug they
      receive. The plan is to evaluate the number who survive, their time spent on a breathing
      machine and time in the hospital. This study may show immediate benefits and may provide a
      cost effective and practical solution to the current challenges caring for patients and the
      hospital space, equipment and drugs to the greatest benefit. Finally, this trial will be a
      team of experts in sedation drugs who care for patients with proven or suspected COVID-19 who
      need lifesaving treatments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multicentre open-label, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial and a parallel prospective
      (non-randomized) cohort study conducted in ICUs and ICU enabled environments caring in
      critically ill COVID-19 patients.

      Participants will be adults who are mechanically ventilated with proven or suspected COVID-19
      disease or suffering from hypoxic lung failure. All centres will be required to randomize
      every available patient, as non-randomized participants can be entered into a parallel
      prospective cohort study to try to obtain the maximum amount of information available from
      the patients present to our ICUs.

      There will be variable randomized ratios of 2:1 or 1:2 to either an intravenous based
      sedation arm or an inhaled volatile-based sedation arm. This randomization will be dependent
      on availability of sedative drugs for both arms. Patients who cannot be randomized (secondary
      to technical or resource issues in some areas of the hospital) will receive intravenous or
      inhaled sedation as able in their designated unit. Sedation will be administered according to
      standard sedation practice and in keeping with current guidelines.

      Participants will remain within their sedation arms until the primary care team decides to
      stop sedation. Participants will be followed daily throughout their ICU stay for 30 days
      after enrollment and then at death or hospital discharge (whichever occurs first).

      Clinical information during ICU stay will be obtained from the patient chart, electronic
      medical records, or hospital databases. Participants will be followed using a provincial or
      hospital healthcare database to obtain survival, and hospital-free days at 60 days, 90 days
      and 365 days after enrollment.

      After hospital discharge, participants will be followed up at; 3 and 12 months to assess
      quality of life using the EQ-5D; and to assess disability using the WHODAS 2.0.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Contraindications to sedatives, such as propofol infusion syndrome or malignant
             hyperthermia;

          2. Known allergy to any of the ingredients or components of the investigational products;
             sevoflurane or isoflurane;

          3. Suspect or evidence of high intracranial pressure;

          4. One-lung ventilation or pneumonectomy;

          5. Ideal estimated tidal volume too low for delivery of inhaled agents. Target (6ml/kg) &lt;
             200ml;

          6. Use of inhaled prostacyclin which is contraindicated in the presence of a miniature
             vaporizer (i.e., Anesthesia Conserving Device). This agent has a high viscosity that
             leads to poor vaporization of the volatile agent. Other inhaled pulmonary vasodilators
             such as nitric oxide can be safely administered in the presence of miniature
             vaporizers. Use of prostacyclin is permissible with an anesthesia machine and MADM;

          7. Known pregnancy
