  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study D822FC00005 will investigate the Phamacokinetics, Safety and tolerability of
      Acalabrutinib suspension when delivered via a nasogastric tube and co-administered with a
      Proton Pump Inhibitor, in the treatment of COVID-19.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is to support the ongoing clinical development of acalabrutinib (CALQUENCE®) in
      hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Because many COVID-19 patients may be unable to swallow
      capsules due to respiratory failure (eg, they may require endotracheal intubation for
      ventilator support and Naso Gastric tube placement), it is important to have a clinically
      acceptable method to administer acalabrutinib (capsules) via NG tube. Furthermore, many
      hospitalized patients are placed on high doses of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (also
      commonly known as antacid medication). This study is designed to determine the Pharmaco
      Kinetics (effect of body/ bodily systems on the drug), safety and tolerability of
      acalabrutinib suspension, when coadministered with a PPI, in participants with confirmed
      SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring hospitalization due to respiratory failure, attributable to
      COVID-19 pneumonia and who have an Nasogastric (NG) tube in place.
