  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TACTIC-E is a randomised, parallel arm, open-label platform trial for investigating potential
      treatments for COVID-19 disease. While SARS-CoV infection evades detection by the immune
      system in the first 24 hours of infection, it ultimately produces a massive immune system
      response in the subgroup of people who develop severe complications. Most tissue damage
      following infection with COVID-19 appears to be due to a later, exaggerated, host immune
      response (Gralinski and Baric 2015). This leads to lung and sometimes multi-organ damage.

      Most people who develop these severe complications still have virus present in their
      respiratory tract at the time-point when the disease starts to evolve. Immune modulation in
      the presence of active infection has potential to cause more harm than benefit. Safety
      considerations when studying immune modulation strategies are paramount. This study will
      assess the efficacy of a novel immunomodulatory agent and a novel combination of approved
      agents which may protect the patient against end-organ damage and modulate the pulmonary
      vascular response. This study will compare the novel therapeutic agent EDP1815 and a novel
      combination of the approved agents dapagliflozin and ambrisentan against Standard of Care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TACTIC-E will assess the efficacy of the novel immunomodulatory agent EDP1815 and a
      combination of the approved cardiovascular drugs dapagliflozin and ambrisentan as potential
      treatments for COVID-19 disease against Standard of Care alone. These agents target the
      dysregulated immune response that drive the severe lung, and other organ, damage frequently
      seen during COVID-19 infection, with an aim to promote a positive vascular response to reduce
      end-organ damage.

      Treatment with EDP1815 will be for up to 7 days, with the option of extension to 14 days at
      the discretion of the PI or their delegate, if the patient is felt to be clinically
      responding to treatment, is tolerating treatment, and is judged to be likely to benefit from
      a longer treatment course. Treatment with combination dapagliflozin and ambrisentan will be
      for up to 14 days. Patients will be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio across treatments.

      TACTIC-E will use a platform design with interim analysis to make efficient decisions about
      efficacy and futility (e.g. lack of efficacy and risk of harm) of the trial treatments. This
      enables the trial to stop recruiting to arms early where a clear efficacy decision can be
      made. It also allows for the addition of further arms.
