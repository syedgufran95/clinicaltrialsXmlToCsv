  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Behcet' disease (BD) is a chronic inflammatory disease which is characterized by oral and
      genital ulcers, uveitis and skin lesions. Musculoskeletal involvement such as arthrits,
      arthralgia, enthesis and sacroiliitis can be seen in course of BD. FMF is an autosomal
      recessive family disease characterized by abdominal pain, chest pain, joint pain and fever
      attacks as a result of inflammation of the serous membranes. FMF patients have been shown to
      experience higher levels of pain, fatigue, depression and anxiety than healthy controls, and
      this has increased sleep disturbance and reduced quality of life. FMF and BiH have common
      characteristics such as ethnicity, etiopathogenetic mechanisms, symptoms, and treatment. In
      December 2019, after the officially detected coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coranavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2]) resistant to unknown treatment and rapidly spreading coronavirus
      in our country on March 11, 2020 in Hubei province of China, the number of cases increased
      rapidly and virus was isolated in 670 patients within 10 days. Ongoing concerns about the
      spread of Covid-19 infections have caused many measures to be taken. Among them, social
      isolation, home quarantine and avoiding collective places are the most important. In our
      country, in the process of social isolation, the areas of movement of Behçet and FMF
      patients, like everyone else, were restricted, their stress and anxiety levels increased and
      their motivation decreased. The aim of our study is to compare the pain, sleep, fatigue,
      physical activity level and quality of life and question exercise habits before and after the
      covid-19 outbreak in patients with Behçet and FMF.
