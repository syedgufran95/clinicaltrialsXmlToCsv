  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to assess the impact of physical and pulmonary rehabilitation on patients
      who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the short and long term in hopes of establishing a
      best practices protocol for treatment of future patients with this disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The novel coronavirus that began in Wuhan, China in late 2019 made an appearance in the
      United States in January 2020. It is a respiratory disease spreading rapidly from person to
      person. Recent data shows that fibrosis is seen on the lungs, and possible myocardial damage.
      Data shows that physical therapy was not highly utilized in recovery for these patients due
      to high PPE demands, and increased risk of exposure. This study will be using telehealth
      services to assess and treat these patients so Physical Therapy guidance is provided for
      movement and returning to prior level of function. Currently there is no data showing the
      long term effects of the those who were able to utilize Physical Therapy in recovering from
      COVID-19 This study will be looking at the differences in outcomes of COVID-19 positive
      subjects who able to complete Physical Therapy Telehealth visits versus those who did not.
      All groups will be tested at multiple data points for lung capacity, upper and lower
      extremity strength, and overall endurance to determine the long term functional effects. The
      control group were diagnosed with COVID-19 and recovered before the Physical and Pulmonary
      protocol was implemented.

    <description>These are patients who were diagnosed with COVID19 and recovered with usual care prior to implementation of the rehabilitation program developed by MUHC therapists. These patients will be selected in such a way as to match the approximate demographics that exist within the treatment group. These patients received education and supportive care only.</description>
