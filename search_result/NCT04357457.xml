  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 outbreak is associated with a surge in ICU bed requirement and substantial
      mortality (estimated between 0.5% and 3.6%). Admission in the intensive care unit (ICU) and
      need for mechanical ventilation is reportedly associated with an estimated hospital mortality
      of more than 30%. Furthermore, the surge in ICU bed requirement is a worldwide-shared issue,
      leading to sub-optimal ICU management.

      In acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19-related pneumonia, vasoplegia with vascular
      enlargement inside the lung lesions and dilation of small vessels seen on chest CT scan
      largely account for severe hypoxemia whose physiological response is hyperventilation leading
      to hypocapnia. Almitrine, initially described to reduce intrapulmonary shunt by enhancement
      of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in combination with inhaled nitric oxide (iNO),
      redistributes pulmonary blood flow from shunt areas to lung units with normal
      ventilation/perfusion (VA/Q) ratio. Low dose of intravenous almitrine (2 µg.kg-1.min-1) alone
      also improves oxygenation (without combination with iNO) by selective pulmonary
      vasoconstriction of precapillary pulmonary arteries perfusing lung areas exposed to a hypoxic
      challenge with a slight increase in mean arterial pulmonary. Therefore, our hypothesis is
      that 5 days of low dose of almitrine therapy may improve the ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q)
      ratio at a relatively early stage of this specific lung disease and limit respiratory
      worsening and subsequent need for mechanical ventilation.
