      It is unclear how COVID19 can be passed from mother to infant. The study investigators aim to
      collect maternal and neonatal samples from COVID19-infected pregnant women and compare them
      to pregnant women who have clinical indications for COVID 19 testing at the time of hospital
      admission but end up being COVID19 negative. Pregnant women who are either COVID19 positive
      or COVID19 negative with respiratory symptoms will be enrolled and followed during this
      study.

      The objectives are to understand the prevalence of maternal fetal transmission, risk factors
      and outcomes of a COVID19 positive pregnancy, and how the virus can be passed from mother to
      infant in the pregnant population at Mayo Clinic Rochester MN. Assessments will include the
      viral detection and viral load in maternal and fetal specimens collected from COVID19
      positive mother-baby dyads, presence of maternal and fetal inflammatory markers in blood and
      tissues, anti-COVID IgG and IgM in maternal and neonatal blood, viral load and viral antigens
      in maternal and fetal specimens. placental gross and histopathologic changes in COVID19
      infected mothers, stratified by gestational age and disease severity, compared to control
      samples.

    <description>Clinical data from prenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum care will be abstracted from maternal records and correlated with neonatal outcomes. Any complications will be characterized, with comparison to the non-COVID19 control group of patients. Statistical analysis will reveal characteristics and clinical outcomes that may be linked to COVID19 infection in pregnancy.</description>
