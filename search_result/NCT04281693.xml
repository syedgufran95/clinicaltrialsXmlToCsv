  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since Dec 2019, over 70000 novel coronavirus infection pneumonia (NCIP) patients were
      confirmed. 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) is a RNA virus, which spread mainly from
      person-to-person contact. Most of the symptoms are non-specific, including fever, fatigue,
      dry cough. Sever NCIP patients may have shortness of breath and dyspnea, and progress to
      acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
      The mortality is reported to be around 2.3%. Thus, early detection and early treatment is
      very important to the improvement of NCIP patients' prognosis. At present, NCIP RNA detection
      of pharyngeal swab specimen by RT-PCR is recommended. However, due to the universal
      susceptibility to 2019 nCoV in general population and limited number of NCIP RNA detection
      kits available, to identify an efficient screening strategy is urgently needed. This study
      aim to develop and validate the diagnostic accuracy and screening efficiency of a new NCIP
      screening strategy, which can benefit the disease prevention and control.

      This clinical trial is designed to compare the screen accuracy and efficiency of two
      screening strategies. Considering that the general population is susceptible to 2019 nCoV, a
      great number of people need to be screened for NCIP. The new screening strategy of minipool
      testing may not only obtain a comparable accuracy to the standard individual testing, but
      also save time and money, which may benefit the current clinical practice.
