  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and resulting COVID-19 disease causes a substantial burden on
      healthcare systems. Little is known about how the infection spreads within healthcare. In
      order to design control strategies, knowledge of the presence of viral nucleic acid and
      whether an immune response to the virus has been mounted is needed. The purpose of this study
      is to determine whether personnel and patients/clients in healthcare in Region Stockholm have
      a currrent SARS-CoV-2 infection or have had an infection. This information will be used to
      understand how the infection spreads in healthcare, to explore the association with
      sick-leave among personnel, and to plan high-quality and safe care.

      Healthcare providers and organizations participating in the study from the greater Stockholm
      region include the following: Karolinska University Laboratory, Karolinska University
      Hospital; Intensive Care Unit, Karolinska University Hospital; SciLifeLab; KTH Royal
      Institute of Technology; Roo Home Healthcare Services (Roo Hemtjänst och Vård); Health Care
      Services Stockholm County (SLSO); Region Stockholm; Southern Hospital (Södersjukhuset);
      Danderyd Hospital; Capio St Göran Hospital; Södertälje Hospital; Tiohundra AB; Ersta
      Hospital, Sweden; and St Eriks Eye Hospital (St Eriks Ögonsjukhus).
