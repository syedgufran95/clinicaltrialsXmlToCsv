  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label clinical study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability
      of the PRN (on demand) administration of PH94B neuroactive nasal spray as a treatment of
      Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety symptoms in adults. Subject participation in the study will
      last a total of from eight (8) to fifteen (15) weeks, depending on the duration of the
      screening period. Upon signing an IRB-approved informed consent form (ICF), all subjects will
      complete Visit 1 and enter a screening period lasting between fourteen (14) and forty-five
      (45) days to determine eligibility and washout any contraindicated anti-anxiety medications.
      If subjects meet all eligibility criteria at the end of the screening period, subjects will
      complete Visit 2, the baseline visit, and will then commence four (4) weeks of open-label
      treatment with PH94B on an as-needed basis. During the four (4)-week treatment period,
      subjects will complete weekly study visits (Visits 3-6). Two (2) weeks following completion
      of Visit 6, subjects will complete a final safety follow-up visit (Visit 7).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female adults, 18 through 75 years of age, inclusive.

          2. Current diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety (AjDA) as defined in the
             Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5)

          3. Clinician-rated Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) score ≥20 at both Screening
             (Visit 1) and Baseline (Visit 2) visits.

          4. Clinician-rated Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D17) total score &lt;18 at both
             Screening and Baseline visits.

          5. Clinical Global Impression - Severity Scale (CGI-S) score ≥4 at both Screening and
             Baseline visits.

          6. Women of child-bearing-potential must be able to commit to the consistent and correct
             use of an effective method of birth control throughout the study, and must also have a
             negative urine pregnancy test result at both Screening and Baseline visits, prior to
             study drug administration. Effective methods of contraception include: condoms with
             spermicide; diaphragm with spermicide; hormonal contraceptive agents (oral,
             transdermal; or injectable) or implantable contraceptive devices.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any history of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.

          2. Any other current Axis I disorder, including, but not limited to, Major Depressive
             Disorder (MDD), Bipolar disorder (BD), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD),
             Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), which is in
             poor control and the primary focus of treatment.

          3. A primary diagnosis of social anxiety disorder (SAD) with a score &gt;60 on the Liebowitz
             Social Anxiety Disorder Scale.

          4. Subjects who meet criteria for moderate or severe alcohol or substance use disorder
             within the one (1) year prior to study entry.

          5. In the opinion of the Investigator, the subject has a significant risk for suicidal
             behavior during the course of their participation in the study, or:

               1. At Screening: the subject scores &quot;yes&quot; on items 4 or 5 in the Suicidal Ideation
                  section of the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C SSRS) with reference to
                  a six (6)-month period prior to screening; or

               2. At Screening: the subject has had one (1) or more suicidal attempts with
                  reference to a teo (2)-year period prior to screening; or

               3. At Baseline: the subject scores &quot;yes&quot; on items 4 or 5 in the Suicidal Ideation
                  section of the C-SSRS with reference to screening; or

               4. Considered to be an imminent danger to themself or others.

          6. Currently testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 or currently suffering from COVID-19

          7. Clinically significant nasal pathology or history of significant nasal trauma, nasal
             surgery, or nasal septum perforation that may have damaged the nasal chemosensory
             epithelium.

          8. An acute or chronic condition, including an infectious illness, uncontrolled seasonal
             allergies at the time of the study, or significant nasal congestion that potentially
             could affect drug delivery to the nasal chemosensory epithelium. The Investigator may
             allow concomitant use of over-the-counter (OTC) nasal decongestants as needed, since
             there is no interaction between these and PH94B (PH94B PER 01A).

          9. Concomitant use of any anxiolytic, such as a benzodiazepine or buspirone, during the
             study and within thirty (30) days prior to study entry.

         10. Concomitant use of any OTC, prescription product, or herbal preparation such as
             cannabidiol, for treatment of the symptoms of anxiety during the study and within
             thirty (30) days prior to study entry.

         11. Women who have a positive urine pregnancy test prior to study drug administration.

         12. Subjects with clinically significant abnormalities in hematology, blood chemistry,
             urinalysis, electrocardiogram (ECG), or physical examination identified at Screening
             or Baseline that in the clinical judgment of the Investigator, could place the subject
             at undue risk, interfere with study participation, or confound the results of the
             study.

         13. Subjects with a positive urine drug screen at either Screening or Baseline.

         14. Any current clinically significant and/or uncontrolled medical condition that, in the
             clinical judgment of the Investigator, could place the subject at undue risk,
             interfere with study participation, or confound the results of the study.
