  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The established Insight(TM) mHealth Platform, a component of the Stephenson Cancer Center
      (SCC) mHealth Shared Resource will be used to create the &quot;Symptom Tracker&quot; app. The Symptom
      Tracker (Insight(TM)) app will enable real-time monitoring of cancer patient symptoms that
      are consistent with early signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this high-risk population by
      automatically (and securely) transferring this information to health care providers. The
      primary aim of this study is to determine the feasibility, ease of use, and perceived utility
      of this app to monitor symptoms and health risk behaviors among cancer patients currently
      receiving chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will use the mHealth app on a daily basis. Health risk behaviors, standard COVID-19
      screening questions, and a single chemotherapy risk question will be assessed daily through
      the smartphone app. Patients will be asked to complete daily monitoring of symptoms and
      weekly monitoring of health risk factors weekly via smartphone app. Those who screen positive
      for COVID-19 will be triaged to emergency or non-emergency medical treatment. COVID-19
      positive patients identified for non-emergent medical treatment will receive a study-supplied
      device to measure their oxygen level and heart rate and be instructed in the device's use.
      They will be prompted to enter vital signs data daily (such as body temperature, oxygen
      level, and heart rate) and questions from the app will change to assess the severity of
      COVID-19 related symptoms and inform changes in level of care, to emergency or non-emergency
      medical management as indicated by self-reporting. The proposed study will assess the impact
      of heightened symptom and vital sign monitoring on the early identification of severe
      manifestations of COVID-19 in this high-risk population.
