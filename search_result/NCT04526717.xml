      Indication : Treatment of Subject with COVID-19 infection Phase : Phase I Duration of Study :
      12 day Sample size : at least 15 subjects Methodology : Classical 3+3 design Investigational
      Product : MPT0B640, 15, 30, 60, 80 and 100mg, oral suspension Study Objective

        1. Primary Objective To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum feasible dose
           (MFD) of MPT0B640

        2. Secondary Objectives To evaluate the safety and tolerability of MPT0B640 during entire
           study period To assess the efficacy of MPT0B640 To characterize the 48 hours PK of
           MPT0B640

    <description>MTD is defined as highest dose level in which 6 subjects have been treated with less than 2 instances of DLT. DLT assessed during the study treatment period (28 ± 2 days) refers to a medically significant event which meets one of the criteria using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 5.0.</description>

TTCI is defined as the time (in days) from initiation of study treatment until a decline of one category on WHO clinical progression scale which ranges from 0 (uninfected; no viral RNA detected) to 10 (death)</description>
