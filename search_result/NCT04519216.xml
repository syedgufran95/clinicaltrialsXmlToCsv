      This project will establish that pediatric and family medicine residents who complete a
      hybrid breastfeeding medicine curriculum that includes an asynchronous unfolding case
      scenario along with telesimulation with a standardized patient (SP) will provide timely,
      skilled lactation support more frequently than residents randomized to an asynchronous
      unfolding case scenario followed by videoconference group discussion regarding care for the
      breastfeeding dyad.

      1. Establish that pediatric and family medicine residents who complete a novel
           breastfeeding medicine curriculum that includes an online unfolding case scenario along
           with telemedicine simulation with a standardized patient (SP) will provide timely,
           skilled lactation support more frequently than residents randomized to an online
           unfolding case scenario followed by traditional didactic breastfeeding case-presentation
           via videoconference.

        2. Establish that online learning via unfolding case scenario and telemedicine simulation
           with a SP will be feasible for family medicine and pediatric residents to complete
           during their newborn nursery rotation.

      Intern and third year residents completing their newborn nursery rotation at UC Davis Medical
      Center will be cluster-randomized by rotation month to receipt of breastfeeding education via
      telesimulation with standardized patient or traditional case-based learning via
      videoconferencing with pediatric faculty. The primary outcome of this study will be the
      translation of clinical lactation skills to the care of breastfeeding mothers and newborns. I
      hypothesize that pediatric and family medicine residents randomized to complete the
      telesimulation with SP will translate their acquired clinical lactation skills to the care of
      breastfeeding mothers and newborns at a greater rate than residents who complete a
      videoconference case-based traditional curriculum discussion with a newborn nursery
      pediatrician.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a prospective cluster randomized controlled trial of a novel educational intervention in pediatric and family medicine residents during the nursery rotation. In this study, we will enroll 1st year pediatric and family medicine residents and 3rd year supervising pediatric residents on their newborn nursery 4-week rotation and randomization will occur clustered by rotation month. The educational intervention will be conducted during the first week of the rotation. Both groups will complete pre-intervention survey that collects demographic information, personal infant feeding experiences, and any breastfeeding medicine experience. All participants will be invited to complete a free online course (Lactation Support in a Telehealth Setting Course) prior to the telemedicine intervention or control group discussion with the clinical pediatrician.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Breastfeeding medicine practice patterns of physician residents will be assessed at enrollment and following the intervention/control. Physician resident participants will complete a survey querying the number of times they have counseled patients about breastfeeding, the number of breast examinations performed, the number of witnessed breastfeeding sessions, and any experience with counseling about manual expression of breast milk.</description>
