  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Mitochondrial disease is a rare disorder. It can cause poor growth, developmental delays,
      muscle weakness, and other symptoms. The disease is usually inherited. It can be present at
      birth or develop later in life. Infection is a major cause of disease and death in people
      with this disease. Researchers want to learn more about how infection and the declining
      health of people who have this disease may be related to the COVID-19 pandemic. To do this,
      researchers will study the DNA of people who become ill with suspected or confirmed
      coronavirus. Their DNA will be compared to the DNA of their family members.

      Objective:

      To learn more about how genes may play a role in how COVID-19 affects people with
      mitochondrial disease.

      Eligibility:

      People age 2 months and older with mitochondrial disease and a suspected or confirmed
      diagnosis of COVID-19.&lt;TAB&gt;

      Design:

      Participants will complete a questionnaire about their health history. Their medical records
      may be reviewed. They will give a blood sample.

      If the participant becomes ill, they may have a videoconference with a doctor or nurse at the
      NIH to perform a physical exam. They may be contacted after their illness to give updates on
      their health. They may be asked to give extra blood samples or complete extra questionnaires.

      Participants genetic data will be put into a database. The data will be labeled with a code
      and not their name. The data will be shared with other researchers.

      Participation lasts about 1 year. This may be extended if the participant is very ill.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality individuals with mitochondrial disease,
      frequently triggering metabolic decompensation, multiorgan dysfunction, and neurologic
      deterioration. In the context of the recent COVID19 pandemic, people with mitochondrial
      disease are at increased risk for severe disease and poor outcomes if infected. However, the
      mechanisms for this link between infection and clinical decline are incompletely understood.
      Given that people with mitochondrial disease are particularly susceptible to infection and
      may experience delayed recovery, we hypothesize that this is in part due to immune factors
      that influence host-pathogen interactions. The purpose of this protocol is to collect
      biological specimens to identify immune signatures that contribute to the phenotype of
      infection and outcomes in patients with mitochondrial disease who become ill during the
      COVID19 pandemic. In order to compare these cases with others of similar genetic backgrounds
      and environmental exposures, we will also collect specimens from family members. We will then
      examine how these signatures correlate with comprehensive quantifiable clinical measures
      throughout the course of disease, from presenting symptoms, through acute decompensation,
      stabilization and convalescence. While this protocol is developed during the COVID-19
      pandemic with a focus on a specific infectious pathogen, we hope that this study will extend
      beyond the pandemic in an effort to more broadly understand acute infectious illness in
      patients with mitochondrial disease. Additionally, it will serve as a remote adjunct to the
      NIH MINI Study, a natural history study focused on the immunophenotype of mitochondrial
      disease that is conducted at the NIH Clinical Center.

        Two study populations will be recruited. (Group 1) Participants with mitochondrial disease
        in any location who are two months of age or older and become acutely ill during the
        COVID19 pandemic; (Group 2) Family members of group 1 to serve as controls. We anticipate
        approximately 50 participants in group 1 and up to 150 participants in Group 2.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        In order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the
        following criteria:

        Group 1a

          1. Participants must be two months of age or older.

          2. Participants must have a diagnosis of mitochondrial disease based on a determination
             by a physician with expertise in genetics and/or neurology. Supportive evidence may
             include genetic testing, muscle biopsy, biochemical testing, neuroimaging or enzyme
             analysis consistent with mitochondrial disease.

          3. At the time of enrollment, participants must have suspected or confirmed COVID-19 as
             defined by

               1. New onset of any of the following symptoms after January 2020 without an
                  alternative diagnosis: fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, sore throat,
                  rhinorrhea, musculoskeletal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, anosmia, neurologic
                  decline;

                  AND report that testing for COVID-19/SARS-COV-2 is clinically indicated based on
                  evaluation by a healthcare provider.

                  OR

               2. Laboratory confirmed positive testing for COVID-19/SARS-Cov-2 performed at a
                  local healthcare setting.

        Note: It is well recognized at the time of this protocol that testing for
        COVID-19/SARS-Cov-2 is not consistently available or efficient throughout the United
        States, particularly in low healthcare resource settings. In order to avoid bias by
        limiting recruitment to only those individuals with access to these healthcare resources,
        inclusion criteria for participants with acute illness have intentionally been kept

        broad. Participants in Group 1 who are initially suspected to have COVID-19 but are later
        found to have an alternative infectious illness will be used for comparison studies. Please
        also note that there is no minimum weight requirement for Group 1. However, there is a
        minimum weight requirement for phlebotomy procedures (See Sections 1.2 and 7.3.1). Group 1
        participants who do not meet minimum weight requirements may enroll for records and
        questionnaires only.

        Group 1b

          1. Participants must be two months of age or older.

          2. Participants must have a diagnosis of mitochondrial disease based on a determination
             by a physician with expertise in genetics and/or neurology. Supportive evidence may
             include genetic testing, muscle biopsy, biochemical testing, neuroimaging or enzyme
             analysis consistent with mitochondrial disease.

          3. At the time of enrollment, participants may not have evidence of any acute infection.

        Group 2

          1. Participants must be two months of age or older.

          2. Participants must weigh greater than 4 kilograms.

          3. Participants must be genetically related family member of a participant in Group 1
             above.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation
        in this study:

        Groups 1 a&amp;b

          1. Participants who are less than two months of age.

          2. Participants who do not have mitochondrial disease.

          3. Study team may decline to enroll a participant for other reasons based on clinical
             judgement.

        Group 2

          1. Participants who are less than two months of age.

          2. Participants who are not family members of Group 1.

          3. Study team may decline to enroll a participant for other reasons based on clinical
             judgement.
