  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to prevent contamination from the pregnant women hospitalized in this clinic, the
      RT-PCR test is performed from the oropharyngeal and nasal swab sample taken before
      hospitalization. In addition, the same test is done before each operation and before the
      operation. The aim of the study is to scan these tests retrospectively and to determine the
      rate of positive COVID-19 cases in asymptomatic pregnant women. The results will determine
      the importance of the measures to be taken in the pregnant women who undergo intervention.
