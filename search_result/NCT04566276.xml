  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted in two phases. The first phase of the study will assess the safety,
      tolerability and reactivity to the COVID-19 vaccine (ChulaCov19 messenger ribonucleic acid)
      administered at various doses through the muscles among healthy adults and the elderlies (age
      65-75 years) (total 96 participants). Phase 2 will proceed dependent upon the results from
      phase 1 of the study. The second phase of the study will assess whether the vaccine can
      activate the immune system or not (total 600 participants) among healthy adults and the
      elderlies.

      This study will be conducted in 2 phases.

      The first phase of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and the reactogenicity of
      escalating doses (10 µg, 25 µg, 50 µg, and 100 µg) of the ChulaCov19 messenger ribonucleic
      acid (mRNA) vaccine, administered IM according to a repeat vaccination schedule (given 21
      days apart) in healthy adults aged 18-55 years and in elderly adults aged 65-75 years, up to
      Day 50. For each dose, there will be 12 participants. There will be a total of 8 arms (4 arms
      for healthy adults aged 18-55 years and 4 arms for the elderlies). There will be a total of
      96 participants.

      The second phase of the study (if DSMB approves for the study to proceed to the next phase)
      will evaluate the immunogenicity measured as neutralising antibody titer (measured by
      MicroVNT [Micro-viral neutralising test]) following repeat vaccination of escalating doses of
      the ChulaCov19 mRNA vaccine, administered IM according to a repeat vaccination schedule
      (given 21 days apart) in healthy adults aged 18-55 years and in elderly adults aged 65-75
      years, at Day 29 (7 days after the second vaccination). Each treatment group will consist of
      participants randomly assigned to active treatment versus placebo in a ratio of 4:1 per dose
      cohort. The participants, the care providers, the PI(s), and the outcome assessors will be
      blinded to the treatment assignment of the participants. Two different doses will be
      evaluated in the healthy adults (total 4 arms, including placebo). Two different doses will
      be investigated in the elderlies (total 4 arms, including placebo). There will be a total of
      600 participants (120 participants per dose; 30 participants for placebo).

             child-bearing potential, the participants and their partner must use an acceptable,
             highly effective, double-barrier contraceptive method* from screening and for a period
             of at least 60 days after the last dose of investigational vaccine.

             least 60 days following the last vaccination.

             * The PI is to assess the adequacy of methods of contraception on a case-by-case

         12. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) must be between 85 to 150 millimetres of mercury (mm
             Hg), inclusive.

             or physical, or laboratory findings that, in the opinion of the PI may potentially
             increase the expected risk of exposure to the investigational vaccine, compromise the
             safety of the participant, or interfere with any aspect of study conduct or
             interpretation of results. This will include any thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorder
             contraindicating IM vaccination

          2. Presence of self-reported or medically documented significant medical or psychiatric
