  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 (coronavirus 2019) disease has led to a large number of hospital admissions, many of
      which require admission to intensive care (ICU).

      Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) is defined as deterioration or worsening of previous
      deterioration in the mental, physical or cognitive status that appears as a consequence of a
      critical illness and which persists after acute hospital care. Also, there is evidence that
      patients who survive a critical illness have a high prevalence of moderate to extreme chronic
      pain.

      Patients with COVID-19 disease are an especially susceptible population to develop PICS due
      to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survivors have significant long-term
      deterioration in mental, cognitive, and functional health.

      This study hypothesis is that a specific care program based on early therapeutic education
      and psychological intervention improves the quality of life of patients at risk of developing
      PICS and chronic pain after COVID-19 disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, controlled, and single-blind trial will be performed. Patients over 18 years
      who have been admitted to intensive care units with the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease at risk
      of presenting PICS will be recruited.

      The study subjects will be divided into two arms, and the intervention program will be
      compared to the standard care clinical practice.

      The program will consist of early care (first visit at one month of hospital discharge),
      therapeutic education on prevention and management of PICS and chronic pain during three
      medical visits in six months, and psychological treatment in patients at risk for emotional
      distress.

      The main objective is to evaluate the impact of the program on health-related life quality at
      six months after hospital discharge.

      The secondary objectives are:

        1. To assess the health-related life quality at three months after hospital discharge.

        2. To quantify the incidence of chronic pain, its characteristics, and the degree of
           functional limitation at three and six months after hospital discharge.

        3. To quantify the incidence of anxiety and depression at three and six months after
           hospital discharge.

        4. Quantify the incidence of post-traumatic stress syndrome at 3 and 6 months after
           hospital discharge.
