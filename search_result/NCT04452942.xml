    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, single center, observational, cohort study of patients to (1)
      describe the kinetics and temporal relationship of changes in eicosanoid and cytokine
      mediators in patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to the hospital; and (2) correlate the
      dynamic changes in eicosanoid mediators with available patient clinical status, including
      measures of severity of illness, routine laboratory tests, and outcomes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Admitted to a hospital with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19.

          2. Confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 as determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
             or other commercial or public health assay in the 72 hours prior to hospital admission
             or any time during hospital admission.

          3. Subject (or legally authorized representative) provides written informed consent prior
             to initiation of any study procedures.

          4. Understands and agrees to comply with planned study procedures.

          5. Agrees to the collection of whole blood samples.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inability to obtain informed consent.

          2. Anticipated transfer to another hospital which is not a study site within 48 hours.

          3. Inability to obtain sequential blood samples due to patient's characteristics (i.e.
             difficult vascular access).

          4. Obstetric patients.

          5. Prisoners.
