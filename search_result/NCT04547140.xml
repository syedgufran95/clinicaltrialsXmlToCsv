  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if liquid alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (human)
      (liquid alpha1-PI) plus SMT can reduce the proportion of participants dying or requiring
      intensive care unit (ICU) admission on or before Day 29 or who are dependent on high flow
      oxygen devices or invasive mechanical ventilation on Day 29 versus placebo plus SMT in
      hospitalized participants with COVID-19.

          1. Hospitalized male or female subject ≥ 18 years of age at time of screening who is
             being treated for COVID-19. Subjects must be screened within 48 hours (≤ 48 hours) of
             hospital admission.

          2. Has laboratory-confirmed novel coronavirus {SARS-CoV-2} infection as determined by

             commercial or public health assay approved by regulatory authorities as a diagnostic
             test for COVID-19 in any specimen during the current hospital admission prior to
             randomization.

          3. COVID-19 illness (symptoms) of any duration, including both of the following: a)
             Radiographic infiltrates by imaging (chest X-Ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, etc.)
             and/or clinical assessment (evidence of rales/crackles on exam) with peripheral oxygen
             saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2) &lt;94% on room air; b) Any one of the following
             related to COVID-19: i. Ferritin &gt; 400 nanogram per milliliter (ng/mL), ii. lactate
