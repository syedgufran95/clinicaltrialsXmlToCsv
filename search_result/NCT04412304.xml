    <textblock>
      The aims of the study are to to associate anticoagulation (AC) regime with outcome in
      critically ill patients with Covid-19. This will be done by describe baseline characteristics
      and comorbidities before hospital admission, level of organ support and dose of AC treatment
      and associate this with 28 days survival, survival outside ICU, thromboembolic event and
      bleeding complications.

    <description>Thromboembolic events are defined as pulmonary emboli (PE), deep venous thrombus (DVT), ischemic stroke and other peripheral arterial emboli. PE is defined as PE verified by computer tomography or by findings of acute strain of the right heart on echocardiography combined with a clinical interpretation of the patients deteriorating as a probable PE stated in the medical records. DVT is defined as DVT verified with ultrasound. Ischemic stroke is defined as ischemic stroke verified by computer tomography. Peripheral arterial emboli are defined as peripheral arterial emboli verified by computer tomography.</description>
