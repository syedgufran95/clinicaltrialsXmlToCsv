  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RESOLUTION is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study of
      LAU-7b for the treatment of COVID-19 Disease in patients at a higher risk than the general
      COVID-19 Disease population to develop complications while hospitalized.

      The goal of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of LAU-7b therapy + standard-of-care
      relative to placebo + standard-of-care in patients with COVID-19 Disease with confirmed
      SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      The purpose of the treatment with LAU-7b is to prevent the worsening of the health of
      hospitalized patients including aggravation such as recourse to mechanical ventilation and
      death.

      The means are the direct effects of LAU-7b on the resolution of inflammation, interference
      with viral proliferation and protection from excessive pro-inflammatory response.

               7. Patient aged 70 years and older who, based on the judgment of the Investigator,
                  is at a higher risk of developing complications.

          4. Subjects must have a documented positive test for the SARS-CoV-2 virus or be suspected
             to be positive and with a test result pending;

          5. Subjects must be under observation by, or admitted to a controlled facility or
             hospital to receive standard-of-care for COVID-19 disease;

          6. Subject's health status must be 3 or 4 on the ordinal scale;

             representative:

               3. Presence or history of stage 4 severe chronic kidney disease or dialysis
                  requirement;

               4. Febrile neutropenia;

               5. Presence of active cancer treated with systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

          3. Known history of a severe allergy or sensitivity to retinoids, or with known allergies
             to excipients in the oral capsule formulation proposed to be used in the study;

          4. Participation in another drug clinical trial within 30 days (or a minimum of 5
             elimination half-lives) prior to screening, except ongoing participation in
             non-interventional studies;

          5. Patient with known renal or hepatic impairment or patient with serum creatinine above
             1.5 x upper limit of normal for each gender, as a marker of significant renal
             impairment, or an ALT and/or AST above 5 x the upper limit of normal, as a marker of
             significant hepatic impairment.
