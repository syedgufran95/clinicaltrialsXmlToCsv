  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to assess the enormity of mental health outcomes among
      healthcare providers (nurses and physicians) exposed to COVID-19 during the time of the
      pandemic in the United States, specifically targeting those areas most effected.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthcare providers (nurses and physicians) on the frontlines of the COVID-19 response are
      facing a critical situation and are subject to increased psychological distress. Those
      directly involved in the diagnosis, treatment and care of patients with COVID-19 are at
      significant risk of developing physical, psychological, and psychosocial distress.

      The data examined in this study will further clarify the mental distress experienced by
      healthcare workers and lead to the development of peer-support and educational initiatives to
      improve these findings. The central hypothesis of this research is that high levels of mental
      distress will be associated with caring for patients with COVID-19.

      This study will use an observational, cross-sectional on-line survey design. Participants
      will complete a 15 minute self-administered questionnaire. All data will be de-identified.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Emotional Impact</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R). IES-R is a 22-item scale with possible scores ranging from 0 - 88. Scores higher than 24 are of concern indicating possible health and well-being consequences.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Health Questionaire (PHQ-9). The PHQ-9 has a range from 0 - 27. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represents mild, moderate, moderately severe and severe depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7). Scores range from 0 - 21. When screening for anxiety disorders, a score of 8 or greater represents a reasonable cut-point for identifying probable cases of generalized anxiety disorder.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Insomnia</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The ISI7 is a 7-item instrument designed to assess the nature, severity, and impact of insomnia in adults. Scores range from 0 - 28. Higher scores indicate increased likelihood of sleep disturbances.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Resilience</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) is a 6-item scale with scores ranging from 6-30 with higher scores indicating greater resilience.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Crisis Support Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Crisis Support Scale (CSS) is a 7-item instrument developed to measure received social support. Scores range from 7 - 98, with higher scores correlating with increased social support.</description>
