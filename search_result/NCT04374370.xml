  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Convalescent plasma has been administered to treat different infectious diseases previously
      with some success. There is currently no approved and proven treatment options available for
      the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19 virus). Some early data has shown a potential benefit
      in treating hospitalized patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 with convalescent
      plasma infusions of fresh plasma donated by fully recovered COVID-19 patients. The antibodies
      present in the recovered patients' plasma may be of benefit in helping critically ill and
      infected patients recover from the COVID-19 virus.

      Convalescent plasma has been administered to treat different infectious diseases previously

      the novel COVID-19 virus. Some early data has shown a potential benefit in treating

      infusions of fresh plasma donated by fully recovered COVID-19 patients. The antibodies
      present in the recovered patients' plasma may be of benefit in helping critically ill and
      infected patients recover from the COVID-19 virus. The purpose of this trial is to provide
      expanded access to SARSCoV2 convalescent plasma (EAP) collected from matched donors as
      described to patients with severe or life-threatening illness owing to COVID-19.
