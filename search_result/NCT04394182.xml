  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The host response against the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) appears to be mediated by a
      'cytoquine storm' developing a systemic inflammatory mechanism and an acute respiratory
      distress syndrome (ARDS), in the form of a bilateral pneumonitis, requiring invasive
      mechanical ventilation (IMV) in an important group of patients.

      In terms of preventing progression to the critical phase with the consequent need of
      admission to the intensive care units (ICU), it has been recently proposed that this
      inflammatory cytoquine-mediated process can be safely treated by a single course of ultra-low
      radiotherapy (RT) dose &lt; 1 Gy.

      The main purpose of the study was to analyze the efficacy of ultra low-dose pulmonary RT, as
      an anti-inflammatory intention in patients with SARS-Cov-2 pneumonia with a poor or no
      response to standard medical treatment and without IMV.

      The exceedingly high mortality rates of severe and critical COVID-19 warrant the evaluation
      of novel therapies that could potentially mitigate the advanced disease manifestations. In
      this context, is proposes a prospective multicenter study. It will include 15 patients, to
      assess the feasibility and efficacy of low-dose lung irradiation in COVID-19 pneumonia.
