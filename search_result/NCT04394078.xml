    <measure>Zung Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>two months after Covid 19 recognised as pandemic</time_frame>
    <description>Zung depression scale, developed by Zung (Zung, 1965), is patient rating depression scale, was used to asses four domains related to depression; somatic, mood disorders, psychomotor and psychological disorders. Each question is rated on a 4-point Likert scale (0- never, 1- sometimes, 2- frequently, 3- always). Scale contains 10 straight 10 reverse questions. The total score is calculated from the raw score obtained (total score = (raw score / 80) * 100). Accordingly, scores less than 50 are normal or no psychopathology; between 50 and 59 points indicates mild level, between 60 and 69 points indicate moderate level and 70 and above points indicate severe level depression (Thurber et al., 2002). The validity reliability of the scale was studied on Turkish society (Gencdogan &amp; Nihal, 2011)</description>
