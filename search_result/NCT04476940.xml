  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Newborns and infants receive passive natural immunity through maternal antibodies present in
      breastmilk to fight infections caused by viruses such as the COVID-19, until they develop
      active immunity by illness or vaccination. Such immunity will become the main stay for
      preventing future waves of COVID-19 epidemics. The high COVID-19 mortality among African
      Americans is ascribed partly to compromised immune status associated with comorbidity.
      Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) is the effective low-cost natural strategy for building
      immunity right from birth. African Americans record the lowest EBF rates and also lack
      workplace support. This intervention includes a 10-hour course extracted from 90-hour CLC
      online program, sufficient to prepare physicians to partner with certified lactation
      consultant (CLC) to provide their patients comprehensive COVID-19 breastfeeding guidelines,
      training, and support to afford their babies the benefits of breastmilk antibodies, the best
      line of defense against COVID-19, until availability of safe vaccines. The Breastfeeding
      Report Card indicates slow improvements in overall breastfeeding rates with persisting
      disparities. Improving EBF rates can contribute to increased COVID-19 immunity among infants.
      Preliminary data in Nashville indicates excellent breastfeeding benefit knowledge and intent,
      but limited training to succeed. Hospital staff encourage breastfeeding but routinely offer
      formula at birth. Most physicians who provide prenatal care do not actively promote
      breastfeeding nor routinely offer CLC referral. This single action by physicians can halt
      routines that compromise successful EBF. The program long-term goal is to prepare
      obstetricians to actively promote comprehensive breastfeeding among African American mothers.
      The immediate objective is to develop and evaluate feasibility and effectiveness of an
      intervention designed to increase COVID-19 breastfeeding guideline adherence and improve EBF
      skills and rates among African American mothers. The rationale is that mothers who receive
      physician prenatal encouragement and CLC referral will make confident informed decisions,
      adopt COVID-19 breastfeeding guidelines, safely meet their EBF goals, and provide their
      infants with appropriate antibodies. The expected outcome is that patient participants will
      adhere to COVID-19 breastfeeding guidelines and record 3-month EBF rate 60 percent or
      greater.

      Phase 1: COVID-19 Breastfeeding Guideline Assessment Survey. 40 mothers who delivered during
      the period starting from January 1, 2020 to date will be recruited and consented to assess
      their exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) and COVID-19 breastfeeding patterns using a survey
      designed to be completed by interview on Zoom, phone, or any other social-distancing
      platform. Information to be collected in this survey will include: demography, medical
      history, COVID-19 status; COVID-19 breastfeeding guideline action; Stay-home pattern;
      Breastfeeding frequency and duration; Breastmilk expression frequency/duration; Frequency and
      volume of feeds with expressed breastmilk or formula.

      Phase 2: Intervention Development:

      Participating physicians will attend two 2-hour Zoom sessions, a 4-Module Online
      Breastfeeding Course, and a 1-hour orientation Zoom session in groups of not more than ten.
      The following presentations, course, surveys, other materials to be developed:

        1. . Three presentations: i). Introduction: Healthy People 2020 Breastfeeding Objectives,
           Tennessee breastfeeding statistics, Breastfeeding role of physicians, nurses, and
           certified lactation consultants (CLC). ii). Breastfeeding Challenges Faced by Mothers.
           iii). Obstetrician Breastfeeding Promotion Challenges.

        2. . Online Breastfeeding Promotion 101: A 10-hour course to be developed in partnership
           with Breastfeeding OUTLOOK, an online continuing education provider.

        3. . Research Tools: COVID-19 Breastfeeding Guideline Assessment surveys; Pre- and
           Post-Intervention surveys for physicians; Pre- and Post-Intervention surveys for
           patients; Consent forms for physicians; Consent and HIPAA forms for patients;
           Recruitment flyer and Breastfeeding brochure for patients.

        4. . Moderator Script for Community Engagement to guide the community-patient-provider
           stakeholder community advisory board (CAB) discussion sessions to review and make
           recommendations for revision to the following: intervention program, consent forms,
           surveys, brochure, COVID-19 related guidelines for pregnant and lactating mothers, and
           strategies to enhance participation. The 12-Person CAB of 4 mothers, 2 nurses/midwives,
           2 CLCs, 2 physicians, a virologist, and a community leader. Investigator obstetrician
           Ladson, G. will be the moderator and the CAB recorder will be investigator Britt, A.

      Phase 3: Program Implementation Feasibility and Evaluation:

      20 Obstetricians/Physicians will be consented and enrolled to participate as program
      providers, and expected to complete the following 5 tasks:

        1. . Pre-Intervention Survey: This is 15-minute self-administered pre-test survey to
           capture breastfeeding promotion knowledge and practices, and COVID-19, other disease,
           and drug related breastfeeding guidelines.

        2. . First In-Person Session: 2-hour Zoom session in groups of not more than 10
           participants to disseminate Program introduction (20 minutes); Breastfeeding challenges
           faced by mothers (40 minutes); Obstetrician breastfeeding promotion challenges (40
           minutes); Closing session (20 minutes) for Concerns, Q &amp; A.

        3. . Online Breastfeeding Course 101: Participant physicians will enroll in Breastfeeding
           OUTLOOK and complete a 10-hour module over a two-week period.

        4. . Second In-Person Session: 2-hour Zoom session in groups of 10 to provide intervention
           guidelines, research strategies and skills for participant recruitment, consenting, and
           survey administration by interview.

        5. . Intervention Implementation: 20 physicians will each be expected to recruit 10 study
           participants in the third trimester of pregnancy from their prenatal clients over a
           period of two months. Physicians will complete a pre-intervention survey at enrollment
           and post-intervention survey 8 months after enrollment in the program. The physicians
           will receive intervention protocol, patient HIPPA &amp; consent forms, flyers, and survey
           booklet after signed consent received by email, and attend a one-hour program
           orientation in company of an office staff and/or resident physician scheduled in groups
           of four. The 200 study participants will sign informed consent, complete a
           pre-intervention patient survey, continue prenatal care, and will be followed up at
           1-month and at 3-months postpartum to complete the post-intervention patient survey.
