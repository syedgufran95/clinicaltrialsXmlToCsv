  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate several of Owlstone Medical's Breath Biopsy aerosol respiratory
      droplet capture techniques for the detection of nCOVID-19.

      These are single use disposable breath capture devices with removable filters and fitted PVA
      strip that directly sample exhaled breath aerosols and therefore, directly sample the primary
      transmission route for the virus. They can be used independently and shipped for analysis for
      the presence of nCOVID-19 using established existing assays available in any reference lab.

      The trial is a non-inferiority trial comparing diagnostic accuracy of collection via face
      mask vs. available diagnostic procedures in standard care and will also asses the feasibility
      of patient use of the equipment.

      Subjects will be recruited at the Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge. Minimal patient
      characteristics (e.g. age, sex) are collected.

      Between 20 and 100 subjects with with a positive nCOVID-19 diagnosis will be sampled to
      obtain to address the primary study hypothesis. Due to the pre-test probability of patients
      being positive for nCOVID-19 is unknown we will monitor the number of sampled subjects with a
      positive diagnosis on a weekly basis. The clinical diagnosis of the subject based on a
      combination of imaging, viral diagnostics and clinical assessment will be used as the
      reference standard. When this number hits 100 the study will be discontinued. In total no
      more than 500 subjects shall be sampled in this trial.

      Subjects will be recruited for the study during their scheduled appointments per clinical
      practice to the site, no separate study visit is required.

      The participant's involvement in the study will be limited to one visit (per routine
      practice) only. No additional follow up is required.

      For the purpose of the study a breath sample will be collected using the Breath Biopsy face
      masks. Collection of exhaled breath aerosols using these single use, disposable face masks
      will require subjects to breath normally into these face masks, the total collection time
      will not exceed one hour. It is expected to reduce collection times after initial validation
      steps to the shortest time providing sufficient diagnostic accuracy.

      Given the non-invasive nature of these breath collections subjects can immediately provide up
      to two samples using the Breath Biopsy face masks. The breath collection should occur within
      24 hours of the diagnostic sample.

      Collected samples will be either frozen or shipped for rtPCR analysis of the presence of
      nCOVID-19 RNA. The two Breath Biopsy face masks can be used as technical replicates and/or to
      validate different storage conditions.

      The face mask will be placed onto the subject's face, covering his/her nose and mouth, head
      straps will be used to ensure that the face mask is kept in place for the duration of the
      test. This mask will contain a material designed to capture exhaled respiratory droplets
      and/or aerosols. Several iterations of these impaction and filtration devices may be used to
      optimize functional attributes of the material for capture of COVID. These materials will
      always have a proven safety for use with humans.

      Subjects can talk, cough and sneeze in the mask or can temporarily remove the mask if
      uncomfortable, to drink some water etc if required. Total collection time spread across two
      masks will not exceed one hour
