  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia nervosa is a severe psychiatric condition. On the nutritional level, one of the
      objectives recommended by the High Authority of Health is to &quot;achieve and maintain an
      appropriate weight and nutritional status&quot;. It is recommended that, in the event of
      hospitalisation, this should be &quot;as long as necessary&quot; and be based on a weight contract as a
      condition for discharge. Within the Pôle Universitaire de Psychiatrie de l'Enfant et de
      l'Adolescent of the Centre Psychothérapique de Nancy, an inpatient unit takes care of
      children and adolescents with a specific valence in the management of patients suffering from
      eating disorders.

      Since the first quarter of 2020, France has been progressively affected by the pandemic of
      the coronavirus 2019, Covid-19. This pandemic has led to unprecedented containment measures
      in France and around the world.

      At the time of the announcement of the implementation of containment, the investigators
      proposed to the parents of patients hospitalized in the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry
      Department of the Nancy Psychotherapy Center who were approaching their discharge weight to
      be able to end their hospitalization prematurely. As a follow-up to this hospitalisation,
      intensive outpatient care was offered to the families, in accordance with State
      recommendations in connection with the pandemic. In this hospitalized unit, weekly outpatient
      consultations were maintained and coupled with telephone interviews, teleconsultation
      interviews and a telephone hotline for the healthcare team.

      The objective of the study is to explore, in a qualitative way, the experiences of patients
      hospitalized in the child psychiatry department for anorexia nervosa at the time of the
      coronavirus epidemic in France and those of their parents, in relation to the reorganization
      of care.

      Interviews will be recorded, made anonymous and transcribed verbatim. The resulting text will
      be subjected to an inductive thematic analysis. The investigators will analyse the interviews
      to identify themes. Then, based on the preliminary results, higher key themes will be
      proposed, i.e. the themes most present and salient in the material. They will look for a
      concordance between the different members of each family. Several profiles may be proposed
      based on the patient's and parents' experiences and will be presented in the form of a
      thematic tree.

      The study will be proposed to all eligible patients in order to obtain as much material as
      possible.

        The source population represents six patients, aged 9 to 17 years in March 2020 and their
        parents.

        Four of the six patients went home on the day the lockdown measures were announced, one
        patient went home three days later so that her parents would be available, and one patient
        remained in hospital because of a physical condition incompatible with a return home.

        The population is therefore made up of 18 people: patients (6) and their parents (12).

        It will be possible to interview the parent(s) without interviewing the child if the child
        refuses to participate in the study.
