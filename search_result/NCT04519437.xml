    <textblock>
      The primary objectives are:

        -  To assess the occurrence of adverse events of special interest (AESIs) in participants
           treated with repeated subcutaneous (SC) doses of REGN10933+REGN10987 compared to placebo

        -  To assess the concentrations of REGN10933 and REGN10987 in serum over time after single
           and repeated SC administration

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of repeated SC doses of REGN10933+REGN10987
           compared to placebo

        -  To assess attainment of target concentrations of REGN10933 and REGN10987 in serum after
           single and repeated SC administration

        -  To assess the immunogenicity of REGN10933 and REGN10987

          5. Medically attended acute illness, systemic antibiotics use, or hospitalization (ie,
             &gt;24 hours) for any reason within 30 days prior to screening

          6. Acute exacerbation of a chronic pulmonary condition (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary
             disease [COPD], asthma exacerbations) in the past 6 months prior to screening

          7. Received investigational or approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccine

          8. Received investigational or approved passive antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 infection
             prophylaxis as defined in the protocol

          9. Use of remdesivir, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), or other anti-SARS viral agents
             within 2 months prior to screening
