      RT-CoV-2 is a Phase I, open-label, dose escalation multicenter clinical trial to assess
      safety and immunogenicity of the candidate Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine GRAd-COV2
      in Italian healthy volunteers aged 18-55 years and 65-85 years inclusive. GRAd-COV2 is based
      on a novel replication defective Gorilla Adenovirus and encodes for SARS-COV-2 Spike protein.

      RT-CoV-2 is a Phase I, open-label, dose escalation multicenter clinical trial to assess
      safety and immunogenicity of the candidate Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine GRAd-COV2
      in Italian healthy volunteers aged 18-55 years and 65-85 years inclusive. GRAd-COV2 is based
      on a novel replication defective Gorilla Adenovirus and encodes for SARS-COV-2 full length
      prefusion stabilized Spike protein. GRAd-COV2 is developed and manufactured by ReiThera Srl.

      This study will evaluate a singular intramuscular administration of GRAd-COV2 at 3 dose
      levels: 5e10, 1e11, 2e11viral particles (vp). There will be 6 study arms for a total of 90
      healthy volunteers, divided into 2 cohorts of age, 18-55y and 65-85y, respectively.

      Participants will be followed up for 24 weeks after vaccination. Follow up includes safety
      and immunogenicity assessment. Follow up visits will occur at day2, then 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24
      weeks after vaccination.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a single dose
      vaccination schedule of GRAd-COV2 across 3 dosages in healthy younger and older adults. The
      secondary objective is to evaluate humoral and cellular immunogenicity.

         24. Received or plans to receive additional vaccination within 4 weeks before or after
             each vaccination.

         25. Has been reported as a case (confirmed or probable) of COVID-19 from the regional

         26. Has any clinical conditions that, in the opinion of the site PI or appropriate
             sub-investigator, precludes study participation, this includes any acute, subacute,
             intermittent or chronic medical disease or condition that would place the subject at
             an unacceptable risk of injury, render the subject unable to meet the requirements of
             the protocol, or may interfere with the evaluation of responses or the subject's
             successful completion of this trial
