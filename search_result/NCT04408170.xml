  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The United Kingdom and wider world is in the midst of the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
      pandemic. Accurate diagnosis of infection, identification of immunity and monitoring the
      clinical progression of infection are of paramount importance to our response. Widespread
      population testing has proven difficult in western countries and has been limited by test
      availability, human resources and long turnaround times (up to 72 hours). This has limited
      our ability to control the spread of infection and to develop effective clinical pathways to
      enable early social isolation of infected patients and early treatment for those most at
      risk. The life sciences industry has responded to the pandemic by developing multiple new in
      vitro diagnostic tests (IVDs). To leverage the potential clinical benefit of those tests we
      require efficient but robust clinical evaluation. Therefore, to optimise resource utilisation
      in this global pandemic, we will conduct a platform adaptive diagnostic study on a national
      level, utilising a national network of expertise in the evaluation of diagnostic technology.
      This study will enable the evaluation of multiple assays in three priority areas:

        1. Evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of IVDs for active infection with SARS-CoV-2

        2. Evaluation of assays monitoring the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection

        3. Evaluation of the prognostic value of commercially available tests for predicting
           prognosis in patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. (This arm will
           not be active immediately but may be activated after initiation).

      Whole blood samples will be taken at multiple time points during the study. Samples will be
      processed and the serum stored. Finger stick samples may also be taken and stored for future
      testing. Throat and nose swabs may also be taken at multiple time points and stored for
