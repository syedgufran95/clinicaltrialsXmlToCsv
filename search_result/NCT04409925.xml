  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to investigate the safety and tolerability of rhDNase1 and its impact
      on neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in COVID-19 infected patients
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been reported that elevated numbers of neutrophils (PMNs) in the blood predicts poor
      outcomes and severity in patients with COVID-19 infections. Acute inflammation results in
      formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) by PMNs and NK cells. Pre-clinical studies
      showed that NETs are critically involved in the pathophysiology of ARDS and increased
      capacity of PMNs to form NETs was shown to correlated with increased severity and mortality
      in patients with ARDS after community-acquired pneumonia. In early reports, patients with
      severe COVID-19 infections were also found to have radiological and clinical findings of
      Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). NETs can be degraded by DNase1 for which there is
      a human recombinant equivalent rhDNase1.

      This study proposes (1) to evaluate the safety and feasibility of inhaled rhDNase1 in
      severely ill COVID-19 patients requiring admission, (2) to evaluate the impact of rhDNase1 in
      limiting progression of disease and COVID-19 related complications in these patients, and (3)
      to investigate NETs as possible therapeutic targets in severe COVID-19 patients by
      quantifying levels of circulating NETs in the blood and sputum and correlating these with
      oxygen requirements, need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation,
      radiological progression of ARDS, renal dysfunction, and time to discharge or mortality.
