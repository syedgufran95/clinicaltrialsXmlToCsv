    <textblock>
      A clinical and experimental study will be carried out in which the clinician will investigate
      the PCR of the virus early in different body fluids (blood, semen, urine, saliva) and monitor
      its experimental clearance and evaluate in vitro diagnostic tests and inhibitory factors of
      viral proliferation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization (WHO) declared Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic on
      March 11, 2020. Due to the rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
      2 virus (SARS-CoV-2), we are currently facing an unprecedented global situation. One of the
      main pillars in the control of an epidemic is the performance of large-scale tests providing
      a quick and accurate diagnosis so that the authorities can take timely action. Therefore,
      tests for COVID-19 should be prompt, widely available, and implemented outside the hospital
      environment, to avoid overloading the health system and decreasing the risks of hospital
      transmission to other patients and health professionals. Although universal testing is a
      cornerstone for reducing the burden of COVID-19, the accuracy of the commercially available
      tests for COVID-19 in Brazil remains uncertain. In addition, the natural history of the
      disease in the different organs and tissues is not unquestionably known, nor because the
      virus develops better in some tissues and not others. There are still many unanswered
      questions regarding COVID-19. allow more accurate knowledge of the natural history of the
      disease in the timeline taking into account the acute and long-term phases. Several families
      of viruses can affect the male genitourinary system, as is the case of the Zika (ZKV) and
      Ebola viruses. There are reports that in young patients infected with ZKV, the virus persists
      in semen for up to 6 months after the symptomatic condition. The other SARS-CoV-1 itself was
      detected in human testicles associated with an inflammatory process (orchiepididymitis),
      suggesting the possibility that these viruses could also be detected in the semen. As
      SARS-CoV-1 was able to overcome the hemato-gestural barrier and induce severe testicular
      damage in the previous outbreak, it is possible that men infected with COVID-19 may also have
      testicular damage. Another question that remains unanswered is whether the coronavirus can
      remain in the body of people considered recovered from Covid-19 for an indefinite period. It
      is also unknown whether there are molecules in the body fluids capable of inhibiting viral
      growth. The expected benefits are related to a better understanding of COVID's natural
      history19 and which body fluids can contribute to understanding the pathophysiology of the
      disease. It will be possible to identify the best time and the test with the best accuracy to
      diagnose the disease. It is our intention to identify substances in body fluids with an
      antiviral effect

    <description>Numerical variables will be described by measurements of central tendency (mean or median) and the respective dispersion measurements. Categorical variables will be described by their absolute values, percentages, or proportions. To compare the differences of continuous variables, we will use the Student t-test or the Mann-Whitney test. For comparison of categorical data, we will use the chi-square test. Univariable and multivariable analyses will be performed to identify predictors of COVID-19 detection.</description>

    <description>Patients with suspected acute viral status for COVID 19 will be invited to participate in the identification of the first symptoms. The diagnosis of COVID-19 will be confirmed according to the determinations of the MS through the reaction of qRT-PCR in the nasopharynx swab. Patients will undergo multiple collections of biological material including blood, saliva, semen, and urine. Each patient will be subjected to serial sample collections. The samples will be processed and analyzed for the presence of viral RNA. Patients with 2 consecutive negative samples did not need to perform subsequent collections.</description>

      Semen, urine, and saliva: Semen samples will be obtained by the patient through masturbation,
      and collected in sterile containers. Urine samples will be collected from the medium stream
      at least 4 hours without emptying the bladder. Saliva samples will be obtained by the swab.
      The first sample will be collected in the first 14 days after the onset of symptoms and the
      others on a monthly basis. After 2 consecutive negative samples, no more samples will be
      taken. Only the virus will be researched using qRT-PCR. Peripheral blood: Samples of
      peripheral blood are collected through peripheral venipuncture. These samples will be
      collected at the time of inclusion in the study to assess the viral load, and 45 days after
      the onset of symptoms to determine the serum levels of sex hormones.
