  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the end of February 2020, Covid-19 infection has spread widely in France, particularly
      in the East region, with on March 25th, 2020, 5,479 infected patients and 407 deceased
      patients, including 256 in Alsace. Among the hospitalized patients reported in the initial
      Chinese studies, 48% had co-morbidity, particularly diabetes or cardiovascular disease.
      Covid-19 infection does not appear to be more common in diabetic patients, but infected
      diabetics have more severe forms.

      The prevalence of diabetes is high in Alsace affecting 6.5% of the population against 4.6% in
      France. Du to health containment measures, asymptomatic diabetic patients can no longer come
      to the clinic in Hospital for their consultation. However, in the current epidemiological
      context, maintaining optimal glycemic control is fundamental since some of diabetic patients
      will have Covid-19 infections. Furthermore, the sedentary lifestyle and snacking linked to
      the confinement period will contribute to a glycemic imbalance in some patients.
      Telemedicine, and in particular teleconsultation, which until now has been very uncommon in
      the management of diabetic patients, represents a very interesting alternative for monitoring
      these patients and maintaining satisfactory metabolic control during the current period of
      confinement and Covid-19 epidemic.

    <measure>Comparison of metabolic control (HbA1C) between diabetic patients followed by teleconsultation and patients with a conventional follow-up during Covid-19 infection.</measure>
    <time_frame>HbA1C measured at 3 months post-telemedicine consultation group / post-cancellation of the face-to-face consultation group (variation versus basal)</time_frame>
    <description>In the Covid 19 epidemic context, the face-to-face consultation of diabetic patients with the hospital's physician or their diabetologist is / will be replaced by a teleconsultation ( phone or computer consultation) followed at 6 months of a face-to-face consultation. Patients will be monitored in accordance with routine practice.
The Teleconsultation (TC) group will be composed of patients for whom the consultation initially scheduled in the presence of the diabetologist has been replaced by a teleconsultation due to the availability of diabetologists whose activity is focused on the management of Covid-19 negative patients.
The Face-to-Face group will be composed of patients for whom the consultation initially scheduled in the presence of the diabetologist was postponed by 6 months due to the activity of some diabetologists entirely redirected towards the management of Covid-19 positive patients.</description>
