      JUPITER is an observational study protocol that aims to understand factors that can help
      prevent/mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and understand factors that help reduce disease
      progression in patients with COVID-19. We aim to accomplish this by obtaining self-reported
      historical and longitudinal data from study participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study that will electronically collect self-reported participant
      data in a database that follows HIPAA security requirements for those with a clinically
      confirmed case of COVID-19 or those who have had exposure to COVID-19.

      The aim of this study is to gather a large, diverse dataset from a large population of
      participants in order to gather longitudinal observational data on what health practices
      participants are practicing and what, if any, benefits these practices may be providing the
      participants.

      Data for this study will be gathered via self-reporting from participants who wish to
      participate in the fight against COVID-19. This will include getting a baseline of each
      participant's health and then monitor their health over time while looking at how their
      symptoms are progressing or regressing. The JUPITER study may also seek historical data from
      patients who have recovered from COVID-19.

      The JUPITER dataset may be shared (in accordance with applicable state, federal, and local
      laws) so that others may utilize the data from the dataset for further analysis to determine
      relevant trends in the data and in turn hopefully use these trends to determine potential
      treatment protocols or lifestyle recommendations to help prevent COVID-19 spread and reduce
      hospitalization rates, as well as to understand how certain factors may aide in the COVID-19
      disease progression.
