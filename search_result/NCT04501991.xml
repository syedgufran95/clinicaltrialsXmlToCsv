  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The strict rules applied in Italy during the recent COVID-19 pandemic, with the prohibition
      to attend any regular outdoor activity, are likely to influence the degree of metabolic
      control of patients with type 2 diabetes. The aim of this observational, prospective, single
      centre study was to evaluate the immediate impact of the lockdown rules on the metabolic
      profile of a cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All the patients with type 2 diabetes who were previously scheduled for a follow-up visit in
      our outpatient diabetes clinic during the lockdown for COVID-19 (March 9, 2020-May 04, 2020)
      were contacted by phone. Patients who accepted to take part of the study received a medical
      prescription for routine analysis via email. They were asked to perform blood drawing one
      week after the end of the lockdown period and transmitted us the results.

      We then compared the metabolic profile tested one week after the end of the lockdown with the
      last value and the mean of the last three determinations performed before the pandemic
      emergency.
