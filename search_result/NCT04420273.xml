  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to reduce melanoma mortality by improving early detection of
      melanoma with skin self-examination (SSE) among people who self-identify as being at risk and
      seek care for a concerning mole. Because women are more likely than men to perform SSE, women
      who are engaged in health promotion by having a recent screening mammogram are the focus of
      this research. Self-management of melanoma detection with SSE depends on ready access to
      dermatologists when a concerning mole is detected. In March 2020, the Illinois stay at home
      order (COVID-19) prohibited non-essential health care, including screening mammography and
      dermatology office-based care, and both are expected to remain limited until fall 2020. This
      submission explores a) the effectiveness of targeted melanoma detection (TMD) among women,
      who identify their risk of having a melanoma, learn to perform SSE, and perform SSE, and b)
      the effectiveness of adhesive patch-based home sample collection for genomic analysis to rule
      out melanoma in moles identified by women as concerning.

      The proposed work will assess the effectiveness of targeted melanoma detection (TMD) with SSE
      education delivered remotely to women who had a screening mammogram. The effect of TMD with
      SSE education will be assessed with a randomized control trial among women served by
      Northwestern Medicine in rural, suburban and metropolitan communities. Women who identify
      concerning moles will choose among three options: a) watch the mole to see if the border,
      color or diameter of the mole changes b) send a picture of the mole to the PI for
      consideration of mole self-sampling, or c) make an appointment with my healthcare provider to
      check the mole. As required a physician will supervise women, who will perform non-invasive
      mole self-sampling with non-invasive adhesive patches for genomic analysis of the concerning
      pigmented lesion (mole). If the genomic analysis suggests that the concerning mole may be a
      melanoma, then the recommendation will be to have the mole biopsied.The effectiveness of
      acquired samples suggestive of melanoma will be examined by the obtaining the pathology
      reports of biopsied moles. Health care providers' (HCPs) clinical/pathologic assessment of
      concerning moles will be identified in the Northwestern Medicine electronic health record
      (EHR) system.

A validated scoring system is used to categorize the border, color and diameter as 1 if normal, 2 if not sure, and 3 if abnormal.The sum of the scores indicates if the mole is concerning (sum of 3= benign, stop checking the mole; sum of 4- 7 monitor the mole for change in the next month; sum of 8-9 = concerning mole make an appointment to see a physician.</description>
