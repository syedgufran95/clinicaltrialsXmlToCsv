  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Novel therapies are desperately needed for treatment of COVID-19 patients. At present, there
      are no proven interventions to prevent progression of the disease or to rapidly treat
      patients with COVID-19 related respiratory failure. Data on the original coronavirus -SARS
      pneumonia suggested that high dose (&gt;160ppm) inhaled Nitric Oxide could have beneficial
      effects also on COVID-19, due to the genomic similarities between these two coronaviruses
      (1-3). This study will test whether high dose inhaled nitric oxide is safe and can reverse
      virus burden and respiratory failure in patients on mechanical ventilation.
