    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 has a clustering morbidity trend and older people with chronic diseases are more
      likely to die, such as chronic renal insufficiency and chronic cardiovascular disease. We set
      up a COVID-19 pneumonia grading scale. The COVID-19 score system was validated to predict the
      clinical outcome of a patient.

      1. First we collect the medical records, according to the time sequence, the patients were
           divided into two groups, one is the model group, and the other is the validate group.

        2. Responsible for the risk factor of regression equation according to the model. The
           patients were divided into three groups according to their total score of risk
           responsibility.

        3. Compared with SEPSIS and CURB-65 grading system with the grading system we established.

        Inclusion Criteria:
