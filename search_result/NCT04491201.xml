  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 pandemics have changed extensively the lives around the world. Although most
      physicians of obstetrics and gynecology have no critical role in the frontline against
      COVID-19 pandemics, their work, research and education activities still underwent great
      changes. The primary aim of this study is to analyze change of workload during the COVID-19
      pandemics in physicians of obstetrics and gynecology in China. A customized questionnaire
      will be delivered by the social software WeChat to the specific hospital which has been
      randomly sampled, and all physicians of Obstetrics and Gynecology in this hospital will fill
      the questionnaire anonymously.

      A random sampling will be performed in all 32 provinces, municipality or autonomous regions
      in the mainland of China. It is assumed that acceptable 95% confidence interval is PÂ±4%, and
      the sample size under the condition of simple random sampling is 600 persons. If the
      homogeneity is set as 0.15 or 0.2, and each population (unit) has 10 or 15 persons accepting
      survey, we will achieve a design effect of 2.35 to 3.80. If we choose the design effect of 3,
      the sample size of every level needs is 1800. Considering 10% population refusing to be
      surveyed, in all mainland of China, three levels of hospitals will include at least 6000
      physicians who accept survey.
