  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a higher dose of low molecular weight
      heparin (enoxaparin 40 mg b.i.d.) is superior than the standard prophylaxis dose (enoxaparin
      40 mg o.d.) in reducing thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19 ), which is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, are apparently
      at high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), as a consequence of activation of the
      hemostatic system which, in the most severe cases, can also be associated with the formation
      of microthrombi and clinically relevant disseminated intravascular coagulation. Concerns
      about the efficacy of thromboprophylaxis with standard doses of low-molecular-weight heparin
      (LMWH) has been raised. Therefore, LMWH at higher doses than those recommended for
      thromboprophylaxis is used in some hospitals, although no evidence exists yet of higher
      efficacy of high doses compared to standard prophylactic doses. This practice might as well
      increase the risk of major bleeding. The investigators designed a randomized trial comparing
      standard prophylactic dose of subcutaneous enoxaparin (40 mg o.d.) with higher dose (40 mg
      b.i.d) with the aim of testing whether high-dose thromboprophylaxis is more effective than
      standard dose in preventing VTE in COVID-19 patients.
