    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand if it is safe and useful to perform SGB (Stellate
      Ganglion Block) in patients who have severe lung injury Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome
      (ARDS) due to COVID-19 infection.

      Primary Aim:

      â€¢ To determine safety of stellate ganglion block (SGB) in ARDS

      Secondary Aim:

        -  To determine efficacy of SGB in slowing the progression of ARDS

        -  To determine efficacy of SGB in improving recovery of lung function in ARDS

        -  To determine efficacy of SGB in cardiac function and reducing arrhythmias associated
           with ARDS

        -  To determine efficacy of SGB in reducing the utilization of ECMO for ARDS

        -  To assess the duration of SGB on sympathetic tone

      Hypothesis:

      Stellate ganglion (SG) is an important anatomical sympathetic gateway/node to the heart and
      lung with afferent and efferent inputs. ARDS is associated with a hyper sympathetic response
      with local activation and priming of the SG and input to the brain and output to the heart
      and the lung.

      SGB block is safe. It will block the pulmonary afferents through the SG to Dorsal root
      ganglia (DRG) to spinal cord and to brain, that initiate the hypersympathetic response and
      neurohumoral cascade of exaggerated inflammatory response and will block the sympathetic
      efferent. It will also stop or reduce the cardiac arrhythmias that accompany the increased
      cardio-pulmonary sympathetic over activity
