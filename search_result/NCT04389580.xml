      Combination Therapy with Isotretinoin and Tamoxifen expected to provide Complete Protection
      against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus

      Abstract:

      The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-COV-2 has infected over 2,000,000 people causing over
      150,000 deaths.Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 and for which there are currently no
      approved treatments.The principal investigator reported according to previous research data
      that combination therapy with Isotretinoin and tamoxifen expected to provide Complete
      Protection against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, ACE2-expressing cells can
      act as home cells and are prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection as ACE2 receptor facilitates cellular
      viral entry and replication. A study demonestrated that patients with hypertension and
      diabetes mellitus may be at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as these patients are often
      treated with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs), which
      have been previously suggested to increase ACE2 expression, In another study by Sinha et al
      who analyzed a publicly available Connectivity Map (CMAP) dataset of pre/post transcriptomic
      profiles for drug treatment in cell lines for over 20,000 small molecules, isotretinoin was
      the strongest down-regulator of ACE 2 receptors. On the other hand, they found 6 drugs in
      CMAP that are currently being investigated in clinical trials for treating COVID-19
      (chloroquine, thalidomide, methylprednisolone, losartan, lopinavir and ritonavir, from
      clinicaltrials.gov), none of which was found to significantly alter ACE2 expression (P&gt;0.1)
      Moreover, another study demonstrated that isotretinoin is a Potential papain like protease
      (PLpro) inhibitors which is a protein encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes and considered one of the
      proteins that should be targeted in COVID-19 treatment by performing target-based virtual
      ligand screening. As Investigators discussed before in their previous clinical trial
      (NCT04353180) that Isotretinoin is the strongest down-regulator of ACE2. and the principal
      investigator expects that Isotretinoin can inhibit or downrgulat ACE2 by direct interaction
      and binding with the transmembrane ACE2, Suggesting its therapeutic potential in preventing
      the entry of COVID 2019 to the host cell. The second combined drug is tamoxifen, A study
      demonstrated that tamoxifen causes redistribution of weak base chemotherapeutics from acidic
      organelles to the nucleus in drug-resistant cells. Agents that disrupt organelle
      acidification (e.g., monensin, bafilomycin A1) cause a similar redistribution. Measurement of
      cellular pH in several cell lines reveals that tamoxifen inhibits acidification of endosomes
      and lysosomes without affecting cytoplasmic pH, Tamoxifen decreased the rate of vesicular
      transport though the recycling and secretory pathways. Organellar acidification is required
      for many cellular functions, and its disruption could account for many of the side effects of
      tamoxifen. A sudy demonstrated that the phagocytosis is inhabited by tamoxifen and
      chloroquine in retinal epithelial cells and Also, a study demonstrated that Tamoxifen have
      weak base property and increase endolysosomal pH and alter endosomal dynamics. Importantly,
      TAM treatment enhanced survival of mice injected with a lethal dose of STx1 or STx2,The
      protective effect was independent of estrogen receptors but dependent on the weak base
      property of TAM, which allowed TAM to increase endolysosomal pH and alter endosomal dynamics.
      A study demonstrated that Tamoxifen have antimalarial effect via treating mice infected with
      P. berghei, which show lower levels of parasitaemia and do not develop signs of cerebral
      malaria, Tamoxifen is found to prevent lung fibrosis and reduce serum TGFÎ²-1 levels. A study
      Reported that Tamoxifen have endosomal and lysosomal cysteine proteases inhibitory effect
      better than chloroquine , Cathepsins are endosomal and lysosomal cysteine proteases that play
      important roles in protein degradation in various cellular processes including both the
      endocytic pathway and autophagy. The role of cathepsins in viral infection was first
      identified by Huang et al and they found that one cysteine proteases inhibitor E64d and a
      specific cathepsin L inhibitor Z-FY(t-Bu)-DMK are able to block the SARS-CoV infection. A
      study demonestrated that Cathepsin D was more sensitive to tamoxifen than to chloroquine.
      Tamoxifen exposures decreased the cathepsin D activity at less than 10 pM concentrations. The
      effect of chloroquine started at concentration of 15 pM, Finally, the principal investigator
      expects strong inhibition of COVID-19 by this combination therapy.

      Isotretinoin(13cis RA) may be able to inhibit COVID 2019 entry via down regulation of ACE2 ,
      AT1 protein and Ang II-mediated intracellular calcium release rather than inhibition of
      interleukin-6 (IL-6) and this is discussed as follow :

      The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-COV-2 has infected over 2,000,000 people causing over
      150,000 deaths. A key host cellular protein required for the virus entry is
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) whose expression has been demonstrated in many tissues
      including alveolar epithelial type II cells in lungs, oral mucosa and intestine, heart,
      kidney, endothelium and skin. ACE2-expressing cells can act as home cells and are prone to
      SARS-CoV-2 infection as ACE2 receptor facilitates cellular viral entry and replication. A
      study demonestrated that patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus may be at higher
      risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as these patients are often treated with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs)
      or angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs), which have been previously suggested to
      increase ACE2 expression. In another study by Sinha et al who analyzed a publicly available
      Connectivity Map (CMAP) dataset of pre/post transcriptomic profiles for drug treatment in
      cell lines for over 20,000 small molecules, isotretinoin was the strongest down-regulator of
      ACE 2 receptors. On the other hand, they found 6 drugs in CMAP that are currently being
      investigated in clinical trials for treating COVID-19 (chloroquine, thalidomide,
      methylprednisolone, losartan, lopinavir and ritonavir, from clinicaltrials.gov), none of
      which was found to significantly alter ACE2 expression (P&gt;0.1) Moreover, another study
      demonstrated that isotretinoin is a Potential papain like protease (PLpro) inhibitors which
      is a protein encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes and considered one of the proteins that should be
      targeted in COVID-19 treatment by performing target-based virtual ligand screening.As
      Principal Investigator discussed before that (13cRA) is the strongest down-regulator of ACE2.
      and the principal investigator expects that 13cRA can inhibit or dowenrgulat ACE2 by direc
      interaction and binding with the transmembrane ACE2, Suggesting its therapeutic potential in
      preventing the entry of COVID 2019 to the host cell.

      Previous studies on the related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and
      SARS-CoV FP FP have shown that calcium (Ca2+) plays an important role for fusogenic activity
      via a Ca2+ binding pocket with conserved glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D)
      residuesdemonstrated that intracellular Ca2+ enhances MERS-CoV WT PPs infection by
      approximately two-fold and that E891 is a crucial residue for Ca2+interaction. Electron spin
      resonance revealed that this enhancement could be attributed to Ca2+ increasing MERS-CoV FP
      fusion-relevant membrane ordering. Intriguingly, isothermal calorimetry titration showed that
      MERS-CoV FP binds one Ca2+, as opposed to SARS-CoV FP which binds to two Ca2+ ion.

      Angiotensin II increases the intracellular calcium activity in podocytes of the intact
      glomerulus. The L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nicardipine did not influence the Ang II-mediated
      [Ca2+] increase and it has been postulated that SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 may attenuate
      residual ACE2 activity, skewing the ACE/ACE2 balance to a state of heightened angiotensin II
      activity leading to pulmonary vasoconstriction and inflammatory and oxidative organ damage,
      which increases the risk for acute lung injury (ALI). AngII via AT1 receptors upregulates
      many proinflammatory genes, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular
      adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6).30 but 13cis RA specifically
      down-regulated the AT1 protein in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Down-regulation of the
      AT1 expression leads to reduced AngII-mediated intracellular calcium release Similarly with
      receptor down-regulation, Treatment with 13cRA resulted in a significant reduction in AT1
      mRNA .13cRA has a glucose- and RAR/RXR independent mechanism for transcriptional inhibition
      of AT1,

      Isotretinoin(13cis RA) may be able to inhibit COVID 2019 infection via reversIing the
      androgenic induction and activation effect of (DHT) on TMPRSS2 expression and helps to
      prevent cleaving and activating both the spike protein (S) of COVID 2019 and the viral
      receptor, and this is discussed as follow :

      TMPRSS2 is both the most frequently altered gene in primary prostate cancer and a critical
      factor enabling cellular infection by coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The modulation of
      its expression by steroids could contribute to the male predominance of severe infections and
      given that TMPRSS2 has no known indispensable functions, and inhibitors are available, it is
      an appealing target for prevention or treatment of respiratory viral infections

      TMPRSS2, a key regulator in prostate cancerTMPRSS2 was first identified in prostate cancer
      shortly after the gene had been originally cloned. Prostate cancer cell lines strongly
      upregulated TMPRSS2 expression in response to androgens . TMPRSS2 is expressed on the luminal
      side of the prostate epithelium, and its expression is increased in prostate cancer tissue
      compared to non-cancerous prostate tissue. Notably, the TMPRSS2 gene is a partner in one of
      the most common gene fusion eventsin solid tumors: somatic gene rearrangements involving
      TMPRSS2 witha member of the ETS family of oncogenic transcription factors, most commonly ERG.
      This fusion occurs in approximately 50% of primary prostate cancers among men of European
      ancestry.While ERG is not normally regulated by androgen, the gene fusion juxtaposes the
      androgen receptor regulatory elements of TMPRSS2 with the ERG gene. The ERG gene is
      consequently controlled by androgen receptor signaling and expressed highly in prostate
      cancers harboring the TMPRSS2: ERG fusion. Intriguingly, the prevalence of the TMPRSS2: ERG
      fusion is lower in prostate tumors of both black and Asian men. The relevance of this to the
      current COVID-19 pandemic is unclear.TMPRSS2: ERG fusion- cancers also have a distinct set of
      risk factors related to hormonal signaling. For example, men with higher genetically
      determined transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor have a higher risk of TMPRSS2:
      ERG fusion-positive prostate cancer but not of fusion-negative prostate cancer

      TMPRSS2 is an androgen receptor signaling target gene and an androgen-regulated cell-surface
      serine protease expressed predominantly in prostate and lung epithelial cell TMPRSS2 is
      normally expressed several fold higher in the prostate relative to any other human tissue,
      though the normal physiological function(s) remains unknown. Importantly, unlike other TTSPs,
      TMPRSS2 transcription is regulated by androgenic ligands and the androgen receptor (AR).
      There is a positive correlation between AR and TMPRSS2 in microdissected primary tumor
      epithelium (r2 = 0.39 ; p &lt;0.001).

      Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) significantly and dramatically induced the expression of TMPRSS2
      protein with two molecular masses of 60 (full-length) and 38 kDa (N-terminus) in a dose
      responsive manner

      Data from Chinese outbreak show death rates for men almost 50 per cent higher than for women
      show that Early research from China suggests women and children are less likely to die than
      men if they catch the coronavirus. Death rates for Covid-19, the disease those infected with
      the coronavirus develop, are low for everyone: only 2.4 per cent of the 44,672 people in the
      Chinese study died. But although roughly even numbers of men and women catch the disease, men
      are more likely to develop such a serious case of Covid-19 they die.

      More than 70 percent of Italy's coronavirus deaths have been among men but scientists there
      admit they are mystified by the gender gap. At least 3,400 people in Italy have died of the
      devastating disease - it yesterday announced it had a higher death Toll than China - but less
      than 1,000 of them have been women. Men are also more likely to pick up the infection in the
      first place and account for 60 percent of confirmed cases, according to Italy's public health
      research agency. An earlier analysis found that 80 per cent of the deaths were in men and
      just 20 per cent were in women - but the gap has narrowed over time

      According to this data the principal investigator thinks that there is a strong relation
      between high mortality in males and androgenic effect specifically the effect of DHT on
      TMPRSS2 protein which is used by covid 2019 in cell invasion and entry and depending on this
      data related to six hormones specifically (DHT) , The investigator was able to discover whey
      women and children less likely to die from illness than men. So, the investigator divided
      infected patients according to their six hormone because TMPRSS2 is an androgen-regulated
      cell-surface serine protease expressed predominantly in prostate and lung epithelial cell
      TMPRSS2.

      Androgen(DHT) potential effect on TMPRSS2 expression in children is less than its effect in
      females and males followed by viral severity and vigrousity in men compared with children and
      women. .

      Androgen (DHT) potential effect on TMPRSS2 expression in females is less than in males
      followed by viral severity and vigrousity in men compared with females .

      So, the principal investigator thinks that when some researchers investigated the role of sex
      steroids in SARS-CoV pathogenesis by comparing gonadectomized and control counterparts after
      infection. Gonadectomy or treatment with flutamide, a non-steroidal anti-androgen did not
      affect morbidity and mortality in male mice following lethal MA15 infection, They may be were
      wrong in their conclusions in suggesting that androgens do not play a role in SARS-CoV
      pathogenesis because Gonadectomy or treatment with flutamide will not completely affect or
      inhibit DHT and its derivatives(5Î±-Androstan-3Î±,17Î²-Diol) concentration in tissues and blood
      because after inhibiting testosterone with flutamide . the pathway of DHT formation will be
      activated to compensate the inhibited testosterone levels so the TMPRSS2 expression will be
      significantly induced by DHT and the treated animals will not be affected in case of
      flutamide treatment but in case of Gonadectomy the expression of TMPRSS2 will be decreased by
      DHT inhibition only if along time has passed on Gonadectomy in order to make sure that DHT
      and its derivatives completely declined in levels that will not allow it to affect on
      expression of TMPRSS2 and in female mice after blocking estrogen receptors it died because
      increasing formation of androgenic hormones.

      A study demonstrated that 13- cis -Retinoic acid competitively and reversibly inhibits
      Dihydrotestosterone So, the principal investigator expects a significant modulation of
      TMPRSS2 expression after treating with 13- cis -Retinoic acid via temporary preventing the
      effect of dihydrotestosterone(DHT) on TMPRSS2 promoting and expression. And the type II
      transmembrane serine proteases TMPRSS2 which can cleave and activate the spike protein (S) of
      the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) for membrane fusion. In
      addition, these proteases cleave the viral receptor, the carboxypeptidase
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and it was proposed that ACE2 cleavage augments viral
      infectivity.

      A study demonstrated that COVID-19 reduces testosterone levels in men by altering the
      functioning of the gonads. So could the increased severity of the disease in men be due to
      lowered testosterone. But according to the principal investigator explanation COVID-19
      reduces testosterone levels because there is a dramatic reductions in the cholesterol levels
      of patients infected with COVID 19, compared with healthy controls . Cholesterol levels
      decline quite rapidly during the early stages of infection and increase as the patient starts
      to recover.Therefore, indicating that cholesterol may have an important role to play in
      defending the body against such infections and depending on the principal investigator
      explanation, Testosterone is synthesized starting from cholesterol through a
      well-characterized steroid biosynthetic pathway involving the sequential action of multiple
      enzymes So, when cholesterol levels are decreased, this decrease will followed by decreasing
      in testosterone level and according to this explanation testosterone therapy in COVID 2019 is
      not recommended but temporary inhibitor of DHT is recommended such as Isotretinoin because
      this treatment by testosterone will inhibit cholesterol synthesis by feedback inhibition and
      decrease cholesterol uptake by Leydig cells in testis and this also will lead to over
      increase in DHT lvels and its derivatives in different tissues, which will induce TMPRSS2.
      because DHT is a potent activator of TMPRSS2 and this will be followed by processing and
      activation of COVID2019 spike protein to bined its ACE2 receptors in lung and kidney leading
      to their damage specifically in testis because it contains high levels of proteases and ACE2.
      Serine proteases are emerging as important contributors to the production, maturation, and
      functional competence of spermatozoa.

      Tamoxifen may be able to inhibit COVID 2019 by inhibition acidification of the endosomes and
      lysosomes rather than inhibition of lysosomal enzymes.

      A study demonstrated that tamoxifen causes redistribution of weak base chemotherapeutics from
      acidic organelles to the nucleus in drug-resistant cells. Agents that disrupt organelle
      acidification (e.g., monensin, bafilomycin A1) cause a similar redistribution. Measurement of
      cellular pH in several cell lines reveals that tamoxifen inhibits acidification of endosomes
      and lysosomes without affecting cytoplasmic pH. Similar to monensin, tamoxifen decreased the
      rate of vesicular transport though the recycling and secretory pathways. Organellar
      acidification is required for many cellular functions, and its disruption could account for
      many of the side effects of tamoxifen. A sudy demonstrated that the phagocytosis is inhabited
      by tamoxifen and chloroquine in retinal epithelial cells A study demonstrated that Tamoxifen
      have weak base property and increase endolysosomal pH and alter endosomal dynamics.
      Importantly, TAM treatment enhanced survival of mice injected with a lethal dose of STx1 or
      STx2,The protective effect was independent of estrogen receptors but dependent on the weak
      base property of TAM, which allowed TAM to increase endolysosomal pH and alter endosomal
      dynamics. A study demonstrated that Tamoxifen have antimalarial effect via treating mice
      infected with P. berghei, which show lower levels of parasitaemia and do not develop signs of
      cerebral malaria, Tamoxifen is found to prevent lung fibrosis and reduce serum TGFÎ²-1 levels.
      Astudy demonstrated that Tamoxifen have endosomal and lysosomal cysteine proteases inhibitory
      effect better than chloroquine , Cathepsins are endosomal and lysosomal cysteine proteases
      that play important roles in protein degradation in various cellular processes including both
      the endocytic pathway and autophagy. The role of cathepsins in viral infection was first
      identified by Huang et al and they found that one cysteine proteases inhibitor E64d and a
      specific cathepsin L inhibitor Z-FY(t-Bu)-DMK are able to block the SARS-CoV infection.
      Cathepsin D was more sensitive to tamoxifen than to chloroquine. Tamoxifen exposures
      decreased the cathepsin D activity at less than 10 pM concentrations. The effect of
      chloroquine started at 15 pM
