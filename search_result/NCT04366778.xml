  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral illness caused by the severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), now deemed a pandemic by the World Health
      Organization. Some COVID-19 patients may develop coagulopathy which is associated with poor
      prognosis and high risk of thrombosis. Some patients develop severe thrombotic complications,
      such as pulmonary embolism, despite anti-thrombotic prophylaxis by low molecular weight
      heparin. The aim of this project is to evaluate modified thromboelastometry for identifying
      patients at high risk of thrombosis. The hypothesize is that hypofibrinolysis with increased
      plasma PAI-1, TAFI (thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor ) levels in association with
      high thrombin generation may explain high incidence of thrombosis in this population. A
      simple laboratory assay, widely available in hospitals, such as thromboelastometry, might be
      of great clinical interest to detect Covid-19 patients with high risk of thrombosis. In order
      to make ROTEM more sensitive to hypofibrinolysis, exogenous t-PA will be added in the assay.
      The preliminary results showed that patients with Covid-19 have significant
      hypercoagulability detectable with ROTEM and Covid-19 patients with thrombosis have both
      hypercoagulability and hypofibrinolysis.
