  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of intravenous pamrevlumab, a monoclonal antibody against connective-tissue growth
      factor (CTGF), in hospitalized subjects with acute COVID-19 disease.

      Eligible subjects are those with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, age 40 to 85 years, with
      evidence of respiratory compromise requiring hospital admission.

      Approximately 130 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either pamrevlumab or
      placebo, in addition to standard-of-care.

      Study drug (35 mg/kg) administration is via IV infusion on Days 1, 7, 14 and 28. A follow-up
      by visit will be performed 4 weeks after the last dose.

      All concomitant medications, including approved and non-approved treatments for COVID-19
      (e.g., hydroxychloroquine, IL-6 inhibitors, etc.), as well as supplemental oxygenation needs,
      will be collected and recorded. In addition, the following will be collected and recorded:
      documentation of SARS-Cov-2 infection, documentation of any other infection(s) prior to or
      during hospitalization, and whether or not aggressive care is withheld or withdrawn,
      including the reason for withholding or withdrawal of care (e.g., DNR/DNI order, resource
      limitation).
