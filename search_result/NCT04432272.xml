    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 convalescent
      plasma for the treatment of COVID-19. Plasma is the liquid part of blood that is left when
      all the blood cells have been removed. Convalescent means it is taken from people who were
      infected with COVID-19 and recovered. The use of this blood product to treat COVID-19 is
      investigational, which means the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved it to
      be sold commercially. This is a human blood product collected by licensed blood banks. Donors
      of COVID-19 convalescent plasma must meet all standard blood donor criteria and must also
      meet all criteria set by the FDA for being a donor of COVID-19 convalescent plasma.

      A total of 500 patients will take part in the study at 8 hospitals within Beaumont. Similar
      studies are being done at other centers, but they are not directly related to this study.

      Participants will be assigned to a study group depending on how sick they are.

        -  Group A: Those who require more than 6 liters (L) of supplemental oxygen but are not on
           a ventilator

        -  Group B: Those who require a ventilator to preserve their life.

      Both groups will receive one unit (approximately 200ml or just under 1 cup) of COVID
      convalescent plasma. The transfusion will be given over about 30 minutes via an IV. Blood
      samples will be taken prior to and one hour after the transfusion to measure participant
      antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and a nasopharyngeal swab (deep in the nostril) will be taken
      to test for presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. One hour after the transfusion a blood sample
      will be taken to measure antibody levels to determine if the plasma caused the antibody level
      to rise. Similarly, blood samples will be taken to measure antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and
      a nasopharyngeal swab will be taken to test for presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus 1, 3 and
      every 7 days after the transfusion while the participant is in the hospital The participant's
      final health status will be determined on day 28. Hospital records will be monitored for 90
      days after discharge to determine if the participant is readmitted to the hospital.

      This trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma as
      treatment for confirmed COVID-19 respiratory disease (as defined in the inclusion criteria).
      Participants in both group A and group B will receive COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Group A
      will include hospitalized COVID-19 patients ages ≥18 years with respiratory symptoms,
      requiring &gt;6 L of oxygen to maintain O2 saturation &gt;92%. Patient may not require intubation,
      and may be admitted for no longer than 14 days. Group B will include hospitalized COVID-19
      patients ages ≥18 years requiring intubation. Patients may be enrolled in group A within 14
      days of admission to the hospital and may be enrolled in group B at any time after
      intubation. A total of 300 eligible subjects with significant oxygen requirements and 200
      eligible subjects who require intubation will be included in the study. They will receive
      convalescent plasma from either a patient who has recovered from COVID-19 or from an
      asymptomatic carrier with confirmed IgG against SARS-CoV-2. Subjects will not be randomized.
      The amount of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA in any unit of plasma will not be known when the
      unit is assigned to the patient. This will allow us to examine the relationship between the
      amount of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody and outcomes. Analysis will be based on measurement of
      optical density of the IgG level in the unit of plasma the patient is randomly supplied by
      the blood bank. While investigators and patients will be aware the patient is receiving a
      unit of COVID-19 convalescent plasma, both the investigators and the patients will be blinded
      to the antibody content of that unit.

      COVID-19 convalescent plasma (1 unit; ~200mL) will be produced by a blood bank licensed to
      produce plasma using standard screening and safety procedures. The product may be procured
      from patients who have: 1) been symptom free for 14 days and screen negative via
      nasopharyngeal swab or 2) symptom free for at least 28 days or 3) individuals who have never
      had symptoms of COVID-19 but were found to have elevated anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG by a serology
      test deemed to be of acceptable quality and fitting the current guidance by the FDA.

      Participants at the eight Michigan hospitals comprising the Beaumont Health system may be
      eligible to participate. Study oversight and coordination will occur centrally, from the
      Infectious Disease Research Department at Beaumont's Royal Oak campus.
