  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the global and pandemic spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19) continues,
      many knowledge gaps remain with regard to the epidemiology and transmission of infection, as
      well as the normal immunological responses after viral exposure. Cincinnati had its first
      confirmed case of COVID-19 on March 14, 2020, and despite extensive shelter-in-place and
      social distancing efforts, community spread continues at over 150-200 new cases per week. As
      new residents and fellows arrive in July 2020 to Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical
      Center (CCHMC), many of whom come from metropolitan areas across the country, it is
      imperative that we determine the current prevalence of infection, measure the cumulative
      incidence of infection over the next 12-24 months, investigate the normal antibody patterns
      after infection, and help elucidate what constitutes a protective immunological response. We
      have a unique but time-limited opportunity to optimally track the epidemiology and natural
      history of SARS-CoV-2 infection among trainees at CCHMC, including risk factors for
      transmission and immunological recovery. SCREEN will investigate epidemiological and
      immunological features of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection within the cohort of CCHMC residents and
      fellows who have patient contact. By collecting and analyzing weekly serial samples for
      SARS-CoV-2 (nasal swab for virus by PCR) and monthly serological exposure (serum antibodies
      by ELISA), we will determine the prevalence and cumulative incidence of infection by
      SARS-CoV-2; we will also document the antibody responses over time and identify cases of
      apparent viral recrudescence or re-infection.
