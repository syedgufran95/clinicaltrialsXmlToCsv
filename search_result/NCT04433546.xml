  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study to investigate the
      efficacy of pemziviptadil (PB1046) by improving the clinical outcomes and increasing days
      alive and free of respiratory failure in hospitalized COVID-19 patients at high risk for
      rapid clinical deterioration, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death.

      The study will enroll approximately 210 hospitalized COVID-19 patients who require urgent
      decision-making and treatment at approximately 20 centers in the United States.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of a Screening/Pre-treatment period, on-site randomization to study
      treatment. On Day 0 (Visit 2) subjects who meet inclusion criteria and none of exclusion
      criteria will receive a weekly subcutaneous injection that will continue once weekly until
      hospital discharge or for a maximum of 4 weeks during hospitalization.

      All subjects will be randomized to either a low control (10 mg), middle (40 mg), or high (100
      mg) dose of active treatment. If subject is not discharged, they will continue to Day 7, 14,
      21 treatments. Pemziviptadil (PB1046) is expected to improve the clinical outcomes of
      hospitalized COVID-19 subjects with longer survival free from respiratory failure at 28 day.

      The duration of hospitalization for each subject will be determined by clinical status
      independent of study procedures. The estimated duration of the study for each subject,
      including screening, is approximately 35+7 days. The subjects may be involved up to 42 days.

               -  Serum bilirubin ≥ 1.6 mg/dL

          9. Any in-patient surgical procedure or hospitalization (defined as &gt; 23 hours) within 30
             days of subject screening except for prior hospitalization for COVID-19

         10. Known hypersensitivity to study drug or any of the excipients of the drug formulation

         11. Pregnant or lactating female subjects

         12. Any other condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would place the subject
             at increased risk or would preclude obtaining informed consent or confound the
             objectives of study
