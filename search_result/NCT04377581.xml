  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effective communication is a critical component of managing pandemic outbreaks like COVID-19.
      This study explores COVID-19 related public knowledge, perceptions, belief in public health
      recommendations, intent to comply with public health recommendations, trust in information
      sources and preferred information sources. Participants are invited to include detailed
      free-text answers to make sure their COVID-19 experiences are heard.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The survey is available online in 23 languages. Free-text responses in native languages are
      highly encouraged. A robust global response will not only provide invaluable information to
      inform clinicians, healthcare institutions and governments about how to optimize the content
      and venue of COVID-19 messaging, but will help write a Story of COVID in the words and
      languages of people from all over the world.

    <measure>Knowledge and Confidence in Knowledge of COVID-19</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Binary knowledge measures (true/false questions pertaining to COVID-19) each have a corresponding 5-point confidence score, the inverse of which generates a weighting variable. Weighted knowledge scores will be analyzed via a generalized linear mixed-methods effects model with a logistic link function and a random effect for the participant, generating a probability of correct response from 0 to 1.0.</description>

    <description>Participants are asked, &quot;How likely is it that you will be diagnosed with any of the following diseases over the next year?&quot; and rate their perceived likelihood of diagnosis for Measles, Flu, Lung Cancer, Ebola and COVID-19 on a 5 point scale. Minimum: 1, very unlikely; Maximum: 5, very likely.
Participants are asked, &quot;How serious do you think infection with any of the following diseases would be (or is) to your own personal health?&quot; and rate their perceived seriousness of diagnosis for Measles, Flu, Lung Cancer, Ebola and COVID-19 on a 5 point scale. Minimum: 1, Not at all Serious; Maximum: 5, Very Serious</description>

Participants rate on a 5 point scale. Minimum: 1, Not at all; Maximum: 2, Completely.
