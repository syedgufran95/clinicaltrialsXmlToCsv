  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since March 2020, the SARS-CoV type coronavirus infection (SARS-CoV-2; nCoV19; COVID-19) is
      considered pandemic. As early as April 2020, the World Health Organization recommended the
      implementation of mass screening of populations, with the aim of identifying cases and
      contacts and controlling viral spread. Since the end of lock-down on May 11, 2020,the
      screening policy has been intensified to fight against COVID-19. Virological tests by RT-PCR
      are thus accessible to all, without a prescription and reimbursed by health insurance. The
      French government has also set a quantitative target of 1 million tests per week. In order to
      meet this target, the number of sampling centers has been increased (mobile structures,
      etc.).

      Screening tests are currently carried out using a nasopharyngeal swab analyzed by RT-PCR for
      the detection of viral RNA. This type of sample has several technical and logistic
      constraints. It must be carried out by personnel who are authorized and trained in this
      procedure and in appropriate hospital hygiene practices. It exposes the sampling personnel to
      possible contamination through nasopharyngeal secretions or coughing that may occur during
      sampling. With the increase in screening, there are sometimes insufficient numbers of
      sampling personnel and there is significant market pressure for swabs and virological
      transport media.

      In addition, these swabs are uncomfortable or even painful for the patient, which could imply
      a reluctance to be screened. They are also complicated in children, whether they are rhino-
      or oropharyngeal.

      An alternative to the nasopharyngeal swab, which is the subject of this project, would be to
      have one or more reliable sampling methods that are less restrictive than the nasopharyngeal
      swab (&quot;gold standard&quot;). Thus, we propose to test and compare the results obtained by
      molecular biology techniques on nasopharyngeal, salivary and buccal swabs.

        The study population is composed of people coming for COVID-19 screening to one of the four
        military training hospitals involved,either spontaneously or during cluster investigations.

        Patients hospitalized in these hospitals with non-severe illness and symptoms related to
        COVID-19 for less than 7 days will also be eligible to the study.
