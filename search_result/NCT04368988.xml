  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      2019nCoV-101 is a 2-part, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled, Phase 1/2 trial.
      Part 1 (Phase 1) of the study is designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of
      SARS-CoV-2 rS nanoparticle vaccine with or without Matrix-M adjuvant in 131 healthy
      participants ≥ 18 to 59 (inclusive) years of age at 2 sites in Australia. An interim analysis
      of Part 1 safety and immunogenicity will be performed prior to optional expansion to Part 2.
      Part 2 (Phase 2) of the study is designed to evaluate the immunogenicity, safety, and
      preliminary efficacy of a single construct of SARS-CoV-2 rS nanoparticle vaccine with
      Matrix-M adjuvant in up to 1,500 healthy participants ≥ 18 to 84 (inclusive) years of age at
      up to 40 sites across Australia and/or the United States.
