  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Baricitinib in the
      treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

      This will be a proof-of-concept trial with an exploratory single-arm proof of concept Phase
      IIa study to assess the efficacy and safety profile of Baricitinib in a limited number of
      patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 pneumonia. If the initial proof
      of concept phase will lead to favourable results, an open-label, Phase II, randomized
      controlled trial will be then designed and performed to confirm the results obtained in the
      proof of concept phase. The proof-of-concept phase guarantees that no safety issues arise on
      a limited number of patients in the use of a drug new to the current condition being treated.

  <detailed_description>

      Baricitinib 4 mg/daily will be prescribed for 7 days to eligible patients showing signs of
      acute inflammatory response activation. The primary outcome of the study will be the response
      to treatment. A patient is considered responder in the absence of either moderate to severe
      oxygenation impairment or death, whichever occurs first, within 8 days from enrolment. The
      main secondary outcomes will include the responder rate and mortality at 15 days, the
      quantification of patients experiencing moderate to severe oxygenation impairment, rate of
      patients admitted to the intensive care unit, length of hospitalization, mortality at 28
      days, rate of re-admission, and adverse events. The duration of the study will be 28 days. In
      the proof of concept phase, 13 patients will be enrolled; if the responders will be at least
      4 patients without safety issues, Baricitinib will be considered for further studies.
