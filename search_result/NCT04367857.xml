  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has spread all around the world and testing has posed a
      challenge globally. Health care providers are highly exposed and are an important group to
      test. On top of these concerns, health care workers are also stressed by the needs on
      responders in the COVID-19 crisis. The investigators will look at different ways to measure
      how common COVID-19 is among health care workers, how common is the presence of antibodies by
      serological tests (also known as serostatus). The investigators will describe health worker
      mental and emotional well-being and their coping strategies in their institutional settings.
      Lastly, the investigators will describe how knowing serostatus can affect individuals' mental
      and emotional well-being and how to cope in the midst of the COVID-19 response. This will
      help to how to better test and help healthcare workers in the COVID-19 pandemic and prepare
      for possible future outbreaks.

    <textblock>
      The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in pandemic levels and a
      global challenge in diagnosing infection. Diagnosing infection, defining recovery and
      immunity has been challenging. Health care providers in particular are very interested in
      knowing their status as they are highly exposed, and if infectious, can potentially transmit
      infection nosocomially (in the healthcare workplace setting) and to their household. In
      addition to understanding their exposure risk, infectious period, and immunity status, health
      care workers are reporting high levels of psychosocial distress including anxiety and
      burnout. The investigators aim to assess the baseline and cumulative seroprevalence of
      SARS-CoV-2 among health care workers using both quantitative and qualitative serological
      assays; describe psychosocial well-being and coping strategies among health workers in their
      institutional settings and describe how knowledge of one's serostatus affect psychosocial
      well-being, and coping strategies. Findings from this study will inform; 1) use of
      serological assays and testing algorithms, and 2) approaches to manage psychosocial stress
      for healthcare workers.
