  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Existing information suggests that a drug called heparin, given through a device called a
      nebuliser, will decrease severity of lung damage caused by COVID-19 who require the
      assistance of a ventilator to breathe. It is thought that heparin could do this through
      multiple mechanisms. The investigators will measure the effect with a marker called d-dimer,
      which is related to blood clotting, and monitor the safety of this treatment as one of the
      major outcomes for the study. The investigators will also assess clinical outcomes such as
      markers of oxygen levels, time to liberation from a ventilator in patients with COVID-19 lung
      disease, and functional outcomes at day 28 and 60 as secondary outcomes.
