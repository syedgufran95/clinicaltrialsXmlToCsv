  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several patients with hypoxaemic SARS-CoV2 pneumonia were able to benefit from hyperbaric
      oxygen treatment (HBOT) in China. In a clinical case published in the Chinese journal of
      hyperbaric medicine, treatment with repeated HBO sessions prevented admission to intensive
      care unit with mechanical ventilation in a patient aged 69 who presented with signs of
      respiratory decompensation. HBOT is the most powerful oxygenation modality in the body today.
      HBOT can dramatically increase the amount of dissolved oxygen in the blood. HBOT not only
      promotes blood transport but also its tissue delivery. Furthermore, HBOT has specific
      immunomodulatory properties, both humoral and cellular, making it possible, for example, to
      reduce the intensity of the inflammatory response and to stimulate antioxidant defenses by
      repeating sessions. A virucidal capacity of HBOT might also be involved. HBOT is generally
      regarded as safe with very few adverse events.

      Following this feedback, it is proposed in the context of crisis management related to
      SARS-CoV2 to assess the value of HBO treatment of patients with CoV2 pneumonia. Indeed, it
      seems essential to propose therapeutic strategies to limit the risk of respiratory
      decompensation requiring admission to intensive care unit for patients with SARS-CoV2
      pneumonia.

      The main objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of HBOT in addition to normal
      management over the period of normalization of the oxygen requirement (oxygen dependence) in
      patients with SAR-CoV2 pneumonia not requiring invasive or non-invasive ventilation. It is a
      prospective, interventional, multicentre, controlled, randomized study. Patients admitted for
      SARS-CoV2 pneumonia in the Covid sector of the hospital, who have oxygen-dependence criteria
      will be proposed for inclusion in accordance with the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria.
      Randomization will be carried out to determine the allocation in two groups: an HBO group
      which will perform a daily session after checking for the absence of contraindication to HBO
      and a non-HBO control group with the same clinical criteria, but who will not benefit from
      HBOT sessions. In both groups, the standard continuous treatment with normobaric oxygen will
      be maintained.
