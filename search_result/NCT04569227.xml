                    -  Chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan (findings of the increased
                       opacity on a chest X-ray, ground-glass opacity indicative of pneumonia on
                       CT, opinion on consolidation, etc.)

               3. Those who can tolerate oral administration

               4. Those who do not need oxygen therapy or only need low-flow oxygen (at least
                  4L/min) but not requiring high-flow oxygen (higher than 4-6L/min) or
                  non-invasive/invasive ventilation primarily according to the WHO guidance

               5. Those who are planned to be hospitalized or who are just hospitalized

               6. Those who have been fully explained about this clinical study and have
                  voluntarily agreed to participate in this clinical study by signing the informed
                  consent form (ICF)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects cannot participate in this clinical study if they satisfy any of the
             following criteria:

               1. Those who are diagnosed with viral pneumonia caused by other than COVID-19 or
                  bacterial pneumonia during the screening

               2. Patients with severe pneumonia according to the WHO guidance

                    -  Have fever or signs of respiratory infections and

                    -  Satisfy any one of the following conditions: Respiratory rate &gt; 30
                       breaths/min, severe respiratory distress, or room air oxygen saturation
                       (SpO2) ≤ 93%

               3. Patients with ARDS according to the WHO guidance

               4. Those who have past medical histories described below:

                    -  Those who have medical histories of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
                       acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), or hepatitis B or C viral

                       condition that may pose risks to patient safety or interfere with the study

                    -  Serum total bilirubin ≥ ULN × 2.5

               8. Patients with uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c &gt; 7.0%)

                  investigational medical devices within 1 month from the time of obtaining the
                  informed consent

              12. Those who are considered to be ineligible to participate in the clinical study or
                  have difficulty conducting this clinical study by the investigator

              13. Those subjects with Hb &lt; lower limit of normal (LLN) for males and females
