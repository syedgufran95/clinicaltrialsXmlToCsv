  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) reflects the hallmark of the critical course of
      COVID19. We have recently shown that Exhaled Breath Particles (EBP) measured as particle
      flowrate (PFR) from the airways could be used as a noninvasive real time early detection
      method for primary graft dysfunction (similar to ARDS) in lung transplant patients and for
      ARDS in a large animal model. PFR increased before the cytokine storm. Early detection of ALI
      and ARDS is crucial for the patient's chance of survival as early treatment, such as
      preparing for intensive care, prone position and protective ventilation when the patient is
      treated in mechanical ventilation, can be implemented early in the process. In the present
      study we aim to use real time PFR as an early detector for COVID19 induced ARDS. We will also
      collect EBPs onto a membrane for subsequent molecular analysis. Previous studies have shown
      that most of those proteins found in broncho alveolar lavage (BAL) are also found in EBP. We
      therefore also aim to be able to diagnose COVID19 by analyzing EBP using PCR with the same
      specificity as PCR from BAL, but also to identify protein biomarkers for early detection of
      ARDS.

      EBP will be measured on 100 patients with COVID-19 positive patients. Measurement will be
      done on daily bases from the time the patient is treated as&quot; in patients&quot; until discharge or
      to the transition to ICU care and initiation of mechanical ventilation to follow the EBP
      pattern over time course of the disease. EBP measurements will also be done on 100 patients
      without COVID19 infection with normal lung function as a control cohort.

      Measurements on patients with mechanical ventilation in the ICU. To reduce the need of
      invasive diagnostics and in hospital transportation for diagnostics with a high risk of
      infecting other patients and staff in the environment, but also to measure the extent of lung
      injury over time, EBP will be measured at daily bases to follow the EBP pattern on patients
      in mechanical ventilation. Preclinical studies have shown that EBP can measure the extent of
      lung injury over time (onset of ARDS and recovery (unpublished data)) Method: EBP will be
      measured on 100 patients in mechanical ventilation at the intensive care on daily bases to
      follow the EBP pattern over time.

      Measurements will be done on patients in mechanical ventilation on ECMO (extra corporal
      membrane oxygenation) support.
