    <textblock>
      Richmond Research Institute (RRI) is applying existing and new COVID-19 PCR and antibody
      tests to help develop methodologies which provide fast and accurate results. Infection with
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a worldwide pandemic and reliable testing for COVID-19
      is crucial to understand who is infected and therefore a risk to others by spreading the
      infection. The tests that are currently being investigated by RRI include:

      A. The RAPG-COV-019 kit, a small testing cartridge developed by Biopanda Reagents which
      detects whether an individual has been infected by the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) by using a
      spot of the person's blood and displays these results in 10 minutes.

      B. An already established laboratory test that detects SARS-CoV-2 by a process known as
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This test is accurate but expensive, time consuming and
      requires highly trained staff and laboratory facilities.

      C. Development of a quantitative laboratory reference test for antibodies (IgG) against the
      novel SARS-CoV-2 virus.

      The above tests are being used by RRI to follow infections (PCR) and immunity (IgG) in their
      workforce, as well as their families and visitors to their site.

      The RAPG-COV-019 kit can be used by non-experts and provides results within minutes, and
      would allow rapid, inexpensive diagnosis of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The results
      will enable determination of whether the RAPG-COV-019 kit can make a reliable diagnosis.

      Collecting this data also allows the gathering of epidemiological data on SARS-CoV-2
      including incidence, prevalence and information on asymptomatic carriers. Furthermore,
      identifying individuals that are infected with SARS-CoV-2 has great potential to improve
      health outcomes by allowing infected individuals to seek the correct medical treatment as
      well as self-isolate and reduce transmission.

      The RAPG-COV-019 kit is a qualitative membrane-based immunoassay to detect IgG and IgM
      antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in whole blood, serum or plasma specimens. IgG and IgM detection
      components are separate allowing for differential detection of each antibody. In the IgG
      component, mouse anti-human IgG is immobilised on the IgG test line region. During testing,
      the specimen reacts with SARS-CoV-2 antigen-coated particles in the test cassette. The
      mixture then migrates laterally along the membrane by capillary action. If the specimen
      contains IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, they react with the anti-human IgG in the IgG test
      line region leading to the appearance of a coloured line in the IgG region of the test
      cassette. Similarly, mouse anti-human IgM is immobilised in the IgM test line region and a
      specimen containing IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 will cause a coloured line to appear in the
      IgM test line region. If the specimen contains neither SARS-CoV-2 IgG nor IgM, no coloured
      line will appear in either of the test line regions. The test result can then be interpreted
      as negative. A control line is included on the opposite side of the test cassette. If the
      test has been conducted successfully, there will always be a colour change in this region
      indicating that sufficient lateral flow of material occurred.

      This is a screening study to measure asymptomatic carriage of SARS-CoV-2 in trial
      participants; to assess the number and speed at which trial participants were infected and
      cleared the virus without symptoms; and to determine the length of symptom onset in those
      with an active infection. This also creates an opportunity to determine the sensitivity and
      specificity of the RAPG-COV-019 test kit to detect IgG/IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in whole
      blood. In addition, this study aims to help facilitate the development a quantitative
      laboratory reference test for antibodies (IgG).

      To this date, 764 PCR tests and 973 antibody tests have been carried out in 424 individuals,
      providing some interrim data. Of the 764 PCR tests, 634 (83.0%) were negative and 39 (5.1%)
      were negative. Of the 973 antibody tests, 96 (9.9%) were positive for IgG only, 20 (2.1%)
      were positive for IgM only, and 54 (5.5%) were positive for both IgG and IgM. 794 (81.6%)
      tests were negative.

      Of those individuals with a positive PCR test, 53% reported fever during the previous two
      months and 75% reported a loss of taste during the previous two months.
