    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, open label clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) plus usual care compared to usual care in approximately 350
      hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The study will be a 2-arm, non-blinded
      comparison between open label hydroxychloroquine and usual care. The course of treatment
      (HCQ) is five days. Participants will be followed to study day 28.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine
      (HCQ) relative to standard of care among 350 hospitalized adult patients who have COVID-19.

      Primary Aim i. Clinical status (on a 7-point ordinal scale) at day 15

      Clinical Status 7-point ordinal scale:

        1. Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities

        2. Not hospitalized, limitation on activities

        3. Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen

        4. Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen

        5. Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices

        6. Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO

        7. Death

      After enrollment and randomization there will be baseline and then daily assessments of
      clinical status and test results and procedures during hospitalization. Course of HCQ
      treatment is 5 days. Participants are followed daily during hospitalization. All procedures,
      evaluations and treatment, including the hydroxychloroquine laboratory tests, and radiology
      tests are part of the usual clinical care for COVID-19 patients. This study will only collect
      the information obtained as part of hospital standard of care. If the information is not
      available, it will not be obtained by any other mechanism. After discharge there is a follow
      up telephone call at day 15 and day 28. Follow-up assessment includes any clinical events,
      adverse events, and clinic or emergency visits or hospitalizations. Participants in the HCQ
      arm have safety labs: CBC and Comprehensive Metabolic profile scheduled on day 7 and 14.
