  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19, which emerged in China in December 2019, has become a pandemic with its spread to
      many countries of the world. Mortality rates of COVID-19 pandemics vary between countries. It
      is known that mortality based on COVID-19 is higher in old population. Therefore the aim of
      this study to analyze the experience of 7 governmental hospitals in terms of patient
      characteristics, possible risk factors of mortality based on COVID-19.

      COVID-19, which emerged in China in December 2019, has become a pandemic with its spread to
      many countries of the world. Mortality rates of COVID-19 pandemics vary between countries. It
      is known that mortality based on COVID-19 is higher in old population. Although several
      factors defined to be effective on this 'age depending factors' regional differences should
      be assessed deeply to clarify both the etiology and epidemiology. Therefore the aim of this
      study to analyze the experience of 7 governmental hospitals in terms of patient
      characteristics, possible risk factors of mortality based on COVID-19.
