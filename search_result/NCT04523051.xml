  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      France and especially the region &quot;Grand Est&quot; have been severely impacted by the COVID-19
      pandemic. The first affected patients gradually began leaving the hospitalization sector and
      some of them required rehabilitation before returning home.

      Because it has only been studied for few months, COVID 19 possible impairment remain unknown,
      especially in patients who required admission in ICU and needed rehabilitation.

      In order to better understand the impact of the disease, the investigators wish to carry out
      a descriptive analysis of hospitalized patient in rehabilitation center for Post-Covid-19
      rehabilitation after ICU.

      The purpose of this study was to describe the impairments and functional independency in
      patients addressed to a rehabilitation center after an ICU stay for COVID 19 and to explore
      the factors associated with their evolution.
