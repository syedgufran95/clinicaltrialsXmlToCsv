    <textblock>

    <textblock>
      Omega-3 Fatty Acids (Omega-3) are long poly unsaturated fatty acids that can be found in
      plants and fish, its refer to a group composed of three type of fatty acids called:
      Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), Alpha-linoleic acid (ALA), and Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) . The
      health promoting effect of n-3FA may be due to immune modulating and anti-inflammatory
      actions . The anti-inflammatory properties of n-3FA are used for treatment of the
      inflammatory diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, eczema, and
      psoriasis . Many studies reported a significant reduction in the risk of cancers in breast,
      prostate, ovaries with supplementation of n-3FA (Larsson et al. 2004) .However, high-doses
      omega-3 supplements such as 1000 mg/day are widely spread in community pharmacies in Jordan .
      Currently , community pharmacy around the world are facing the challenge of increased demand
      for care of uninfected people with Covid -19. Accordingly , the current randomized clinical
      trial was designed to evaluate the effect of daily 300 mg of omega 3-FA supplements on the
      immune health status of uninfected people with Covid-19 as a part of as a part of preventive
      health care .

      Therefore , this RCT aims to assess whether regular daily dose of regular daily dose of omega
      3-FA (300 mg) for 2 months supplementation against COVID-19 infection as a part of preventive
      treatment protocol in uninfected Jordanian peoples. The investigators hypothesize that the
      regular dose of omega 3-FA (300 mg) /day for 2 months will significantly change immune
      responses compared with the control group.
