  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether an empirically validated treatment for
      insomnia (CBT-I) administered early in the course of sleep disturbance can prevent insomnia
      disorder or lessen negative mental health outcomes in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis in
      adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 Pandemic and the resulting mass home confinement enacted to mitigate disease
      spread has created an environment of stress and drastic disruption to daily life. Increases
      in stress, social isolation, loss of daily routine, decreased physical activity, and excess
      screen time that are likely to arise as a function of the pandemic and mitigation efforts are
      risk factors for developing insomnia. Left unchecked, this acute insomnia can become chronic,
      resulting in increased risk of negative mental health outcomes such as depression, anxiety,
      and suicidality. The current proposal aims to test whether a telehealth intervention for
      insomnia can be used to not only prevent the progression of acute to chronic insomnia, but
      also prevent the worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms, suicidality, and quality of life in
      those most vulnerable to negative mental health outcomes.

      These aims will be achieved through a randomized 2-arm controlled trial design. 100 eligible
      adults experiencing sleep disturbances and who also have a history of depression and are in
      the at-risk group for COVID-19 will be randomized to receive either a sleep intervention
      (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia, CBT-I; n=50) or a 7-month waitlist (n=50). CBT-I
      improves sleep patterns through a combination of sleep restriction, stimulus control,
      mindfulness training, cognitive therapy targeting dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and
      sleep hygiene education. Neuropsychiatric symptoms, Quality of Life, suicidality, and sleep
      disruption will be assessed at baseline (Week 0) and at the end of the sleep intervention (or
      Week 7) through online surveys and clinical interviews. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (anxiety
      and depression) and sleep disturbance (Insomnia Severity Index, and sleep diaries) will be
      assayed at baseline and each week throughout treatment/waitlist to assess week-to-week
      changes following an increasing number of CBT-I sessions. Neuropsychiatric symptoms, quality
      of life, suicidality, and sleep will be assessed again at 3-months (Week 15), 7-months, and
      13-months after baseline.

    <measure>Change in Insomnia Clinical Diagnosis</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at week 0 and week 15</time_frame>
    <description>Whether the participant has an insomnia clinical diagnosis will be measured by the DUKE. The DUKE is a structured interview which screens for sleep disorders in accordance with criteria of both the DSM-IV and the international classification of sleep disorders (ICSD-2). The DUKE is composed of 4 modules that assess sleep disorder symptoms associated with complaints of insomnia, sleep disorders associated with complaints of hypersomnia, circadian rhythm sleep disorders, and sleep disorders associated with parasomnias.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI) Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at week 0 and week 15</time_frame>
    <description>This measure is of the Beck Depression Inventory-II total score after excluding one sleep item. The average item score for the remaining 20 items will be multiplied by 21 (the original number of items), to create a modified depression scale that maintains the original range (ranges: 0-13 minimal, 14-19 mild, 20-28 moderate, and 29-63 severe).
The BDI-II is a 21-item self-report scale with high validity and reliability that assesses the severity of depression symptoms. The depression items consist of: sadness, pessimism, past failure, loss of pleasure, guilty feelings, punishment feelings, self-dislike, self-criticalness, suicidal thoughts or wishes, crying, agitation, loss of interest, indecisiveness, worthlessness, loss of energy, changes in sleeping pattern, irritability, changes in appetite, concentration difficulty, tiredness or fatigue, and loss of interest in sex. Items are scored from 0 to 3, and higher scores indicate greater levels of severity.</description>

The BAI consists of two factors: somatic and cognitive.</description>

The FIRST has good reliability and validity and has demonstrated high internal consistency across multiple demographics in both males and females, in young and middle-aged adults, and in clinical and population-based samples. Individual items are summed for a total score range of 9 to 36, with higher scores corresponding to more difficulty sleeping</description>

    <description>Participants will meet with a psychologist through telehealth once a week for four weeks to complete a brief CBT-I intervention. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia consists of a cognitive therapy and a behavioral therapy. The cognitive therapy is designed to identify incorrect ideas about sleep, challenge their validity, and replace them with correct information. This therapy tries to reduce worry, anxiety, and fear that one won't sleep by providing accurate information about sleep. The behavioral therapy increases sleep quality by limiting excessive time spent in bed to increase homeostatic sleep drive and sleep consolidation.</description>
