  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation is a randomized intervention trial that evaluates behavioral nudges (BN)
      to increase hand washing behavior and subsequently reduce COVID-19 spreading to a targeted
      high-risk patient population based in Wisconsin.

    <measure>Hand Washing Behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks post-enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Measured via adapted version of a previously validated questionnaire (Hygiene Inventory - 23), which specifically includes (a) 1 item about approximate hand washing frequency on an average day, with response options of whole numbers from 0-29 and an additional option of &quot;30 or more&quot; where higher numbers are generally considered better outcomes, (b) 10 items about hand washing behavior in various contexts, with response options of &quot;1 - Never&quot;, &quot;2 - Occasionally&quot;, &quot;3 - Usually&quot;, and &quot;4 - Always&quot; where higher scores are considered better outcomes, and (c) 1 item about general hand hygiene using antibacterial gel or wipes, with response options of &quot;1 - Never&quot;, &quot;2 - Occasionally&quot;, &quot;3 - Usually&quot;, and &quot;4 - Always&quot; where higher scores are considered better outcomes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Outcomes - General/Internal Medicine</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks post-enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Patient frequency/rate for the following variables measured via electronic medical record:
ED visit (respiratory illness/other) ED visit reason (if non-respiratory) Admission (respiratory Illness) Respiratory Illness secondary to COVID19 ICU admission due to respiratory illness ICU admission due to COVID19 Mechanical Respiratory support Duration of Mechanical support (days) Mortality (respiratory Illness/other)</description>

Respiratory Illness at time of Delivery Pre-delivery COVID19 testing Delivery plan altered due to respiratory illness Miscarriage Preterm labor/birth Preeclampsia Respiratory Illness in newborn Newborn COVID19 testing</description>

    <description>Patient frequency/rate for the following variables measured via electronic medical record:
Respiratory Illness at time of surgery Pre-Operative COVID19 testing Surgery delayed due to respiratory illness Surgery delayed due to COVID19 positive Adverse outcome secondary to delay in surgery Post operative intubation &gt;2 days Post operative unplanned reintubation Post operative pneumonia Post operative respiratory illness secondary to COVID19</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Inertia</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants simply receive and subsequently have &quot;default&quot; access (i.e., readily and immediately available) to handwashing (HW) materials. This condition will functionally serve as a control comparison. As the term implies, inertia capitalizes on minimizing effort necessary (e.g., going to the grocery store) to engage in HW behavior in one's personal environment.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Anchoring</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Involves once again providing &quot;default access&quot; to HW materials as above, but adds an explicit written cue to wash hands at a rate of (15) times per day, which is placed directly on the soap dispenser. The stimulus is intended to deliberately prime participant thinking (and subsequent behavior) towards a higher reference point that &quot;overshoots&quot; a desired target rate of 10+ daily HWs.</description>
