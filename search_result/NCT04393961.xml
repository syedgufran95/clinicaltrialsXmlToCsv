  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radish Health and ProofPilot in coordination with Sanesco are running this study to help
      establish whether the Premier Biotech COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette (Whole
      Blood/Serum/Plasma Authorized for distribution under emergency use authorization - though not
      yet FDA reviewed) can be conducted effectively at home to detect COVID-19 antibodies among
      individuals who have tested positive, or suspect they have previous contracted from COVID-19
      and recovered. The study also aims to examine how the results of those tests change
      social-distancing behaviors and general anxiety over 8 weeks post-test.

    <description>Current emergency situation, there are large numbers of COVID-19 Antibody tests being made available at a record pace.
The protocol is designed to be test agnostic. However, for this first volley, we have chosen the The COVID-19 IgG and IgM Rapid Test provided by Premier Biotech.
We chose the Precision Bio test for 4 reasons
It is available as a single use test kit in one sealed unit.
It's a rapid test, with results available in 10 minutes.
It has clear and easy to read instructions already included
It has one of the lowest false positive rates of known tests at the moment</description>
