    <textblock>
      A study of renal blood flow and renal oxygenation measured by magnetic resonance after a
      standardized fluid challenge in critically ill, resuscitated, patients with sepsis due to
      COVID-19 or other agents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill, septic patients with or without acute kidney injury (AKI) above 18 years of
      age who have been circulatory and respiratory stabilized will be screened for inclusion.

      After the patients have been adequately treated with antimicrobial agents, source control and
      circulatory and respiratory stabilized, the patient will be moved to the Magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI)-suite and placed in the MRI-camera. We plan to, at the same time, study renal
      blood flow (RBF) and oxygenation with 4 different MRI techniques; arterial spin labeling
      (ASL), Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD)-technique, T(2) -Relaxation-Under-Spin-Tagging
      (TRUST) and Phase contrast at two conditions;

        1. at baseline after stabilization

        2. after intravenous infusion of 7,5 ml/kg mL Ringer's acetate

      The following data will be registered:

        1. Age, gender, length and weight,

        2. concomitant diseases and treatment,

        3. present disease and treatment,

        4. source of admission - emergency department or ordinary ward,

        5. daily laboratory reports,

        6. results from other investigations, e.g. x-rays, cultures etc.,

        7. recordings from the intensive care unit (ICU) monitors

        8. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) - duration type, flow rate, replacement
           fluid, etc.

        9. dead or alive at discharge and 90 days mortality,

       10. renal function at discharge,

       11. treatment restrictions,

       12. if the patient has died, the results from a possible postmortem examination. As well as
           all data obtained during the MRI-examination.
