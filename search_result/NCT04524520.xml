  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel coronavirus, designated corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in a
      Pandemic at the time of writing (27th April) the reported number of confirmed cases exceeding
      3 million and over 200000 associated deaths.

      The burden on global critical care has been considerable. As of 24th April there have been
      8752 UK critical care admissions with services under considerable strain, and a mortality
      rate over 50%. Survivors of critical illness will require significant input.

      This study will perform mixed methods to provide rich data on risk stratification and
      recovery from critical illness. Recovery from a novel disease requires documenting and the
      study reports physical and psychological changes following hospital discharge in survivors.
      In addition qualitative interviews are being conducted with patients who have survived and
      been discharged from critical care along with their relatives and treating professionals, to
      better understand their needs during recovery.

    <description>Short Form Survey on health related quality of life (SF-12). Two summary scores are reported from the SF-12 - a mental component score (MCS-12) and a physical component score (PCS-12). The scores may be reported as Z-scores (difference compared to the population average, measured in standard deviations). The United States population average PCS-12 and MCS-12 are both 50 points. Higher scores indicate better outcome.</description>
