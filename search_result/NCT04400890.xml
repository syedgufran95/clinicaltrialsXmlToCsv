  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence that a specific plant polyphenol (a commercially available supplement)
      might help fight coronavirus as well as help protect the body from the effects of disease
      (COVID-19) caused by the infection. In this proof-of-concept pilot study we will compare the
      effects of a specific plant polyphenol to placebo to assess the safety of the polyphenol and
      explore effectiveness.

    <textblock>
      This randomized placebo-controlled trial is for the outpatient treatment of COVID-19. The
      purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and explore the effectiveness of a plant
      polyphenol, that is commercially available as a dietary supplement*, being re-purposed for
      patients with early COVID-19. Published in vitro data supports that this polyphenol inhibits
      coronavirus replication while separately published in silico (computer molecular docking
      analysis) reports have identified specific molecular targets of the polyphenol against
      SARS-CoV2. Animal studies also demonstrate that the polyphenol is effective at preventing
      lung injury and death in certain animal models of viral infections. Furthermore, the products
      long history as an anti-inflammatory might prevent the cytokine storm that is associated with
      worse outcomes in COVID-19.

      200 subjects, 45 and older, (100 receiving the plant polyphenol, 100 receiving placebo) will
      be enrolled in study to compare whether taking the specific Plant Polyphenol will reduce the
      rate of hospitalization. Subjects will take the treatment 4 times a day for a minimum of 7
      days (up to 15 days depending on duration of symptoms) plus both groups will receive Vitamin
      D3 100,000 IU to augment the effects of the specific Plant Polyphenol (supplement). The
      primary outcome measure for this trial is reduction in hospitalization at 21 days from
      enrollment.

      *Do to concerns of patients self medicating with unproven treatments for COVID-19, the
      specific plant polyphenol (supplement) being used is being concealed from patients until the
      study is complete.
