  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The experience of a loved one's stay in a COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU), either
      intubated or on respiratory support, forces family caregivers (hereafter 'caregivers') to
      face core existential fears, such as uncertainty and death. It also poses a serious threat to
      basic human needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness, as family caregivers have no
      control over the illness, and limited prior competence in dealing with critical illness.
      COVID-19 likely aggravates this experience, as social distancing cuts caregivers off from
      visiting patients in the ICU, from using their usual social supportive network and the threat
      of infection extends to caregivers themselves, their children and family. Combined, these
      extreme circumstances put caregivers in emotional turmoil and in need of psychological
      support and assistance in managing difficult emotions. ICU caregivers are at risk of
      developing clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety or posttraumatic stress. During the
      patient's ICU stay, caregivers experience peri-traumatic distress, such as helplessness,
      grief, frustration and anger, that may predict later posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
      Symptoms of anxiety and PTSD may last for months to years after the patient's discharge.
      Further, caregivers of patients who die in an ICU may be at greater risk of prolonged grief
      disorder. Supportive interventions may reduce psychological late effects in ICU caregivers,
      but the primary focus of the majority of interventions has been on communication or surrogate
      decision making. The CO-CarES study aims to develop and test the feasibility of a
      tele-delivered psychological intervention to enable caregivers of ICU patients with COVID-19
      to better endure the overwhelming uncertainty and emotional strain and reduce the risk of
      posttraumatic stress and prolonged grief. The study hypothesizes that providing psychological
      intervention during and after the patients' hospitalization, can decrease peri-traumatic
      distress during ICU hospitalization and decrease risk of post-traumatic stress, anxiety,
      depression and perceived stress following discharge, as well as prolonged grief in
      bereavement. A secondary hypothesis is that changes in emotion regulation mediate effects of
      the intervention on long-term psychological outcomes.

    <description>The intervention consists of two (or one, if preferred by caregivers) weekly tele-sessions during the ICU stay, lasting up to 30 minutes, and two sessions in the month after discharge from or death in the ICU. Sessions will be conducted via phone-calls or video-conferencing. Therapists will 1) validate caregivers' subjective experience, 2) normalize and psychoeducate about emotional reactions, and 3) offer emotion regulation drawing on contemporary cognitive treatment packages of decentering, acceptance and emotion tolerance. Sessions for bereaved caregivers will include psycho-education about grief, assessment of risk for adverse outcomes and information about available support, if needed. The intervention will be performed based on an intervention manual. The content of the intervention will be continually adapted and tailored to the needs of the participating caregivers by involving all caregivers in co-creating the intervention trough brief post-session interviews.</description>
