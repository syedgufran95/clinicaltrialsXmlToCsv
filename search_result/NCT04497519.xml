      Rationale:

      This protocol describes a study on the local tolerability of dry powder hydroxychloroquine
      using the Cyclops in healthy volunteers.

      Objective:

        -  Primary objective is to assess the local tolerability of dry powder hydroxychloroquine
           sulphate via the Cyclops at different dosages.

        -  Secondary objective is to investigate systemic pharmacokinetic parameters of dry powder
           hydroxychloroquine sulphate via the Cyclops at different dosages.

      Study design: single center, ascending dose study Study population: twelve healthy volunteers

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      The local tolerability of the inhalation of dry powder hydroxychloroquine sulphate (5, 10 and
      20 mg) defined by a lung function deterioration (a drop of forced expiratory volume in 1
      second (FEV1) of &gt;15%), cough, or any other reported adverse event. Pharmacokinetic
      parameters will be derived from calculated actual inhaled dose (dose minus remainder in
      inhaler after inhalation) and in blood samples drawn pre-dose, at 0.5 and 2 and 3.5 hrs after
      inhalation. The inspiratory parameters during the inhalation maneuver are critical to explore
      predictors for drug exposure. The following parameters will be measured/calculated: dPmax
      (maximum pressure drop), Vi (inhaled volume), Ti (total inhalation time), PIF (peak
      inspiratory flow rate), MIF (mean inspiratory flow rate) and the FIR (average flow increase
      rate between 20% and 80% of PIF).

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: The participants included are healthy volunteers. They will receive three
      different doses of hydroxychloroquine sulphate using the dry powder inhaler (DPI) with (at
      least) seven days in between doses. Before using the dry powder inhaler (DPI), they will
      receive instructions and their inspiratory flow will be tested. To investigate local
      tolerability, lung function tests will be performed, and the occurrence of adverse events
      will be scored. Furthermore, before each test dose an indwelling cannula will be inserted and
      blood samples will be taken before and after each test dose. Four blood samples will be
      collected with each inhaled dose. Finally, five ECGs will be obtained to monitor for QT
      prolongation, one at the screenings visit, one at base-line and one after each inhalation.
