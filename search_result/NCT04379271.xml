    <textblock>
      At present there is no approved drug treatment for Covid-19. In this study we plan to
      investigate if an experimental drug called IMU-838 (vidofludimus calcium) can improve your
      symptoms, prevent worsening that would initiate further treatments such as ventilation, and
      can lower your virus number if given in addition to your doctor's choice of standard therapy.
      We will also test if IMU-838 has any side effects and measure the level of IMU 838 in your
      blood.

      Experimental drug means that it is not yet authorized for marketing in your country. To date
      approximately 600 individuals have received IMU-838 (or a drug similar to IMU-838 that
      contains the same active substance as IMU-838) in research studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial consists of a Phase 2 proof-of-concept phase (Part 1) with the option to extend
      enrollment (without interruption) to Phase 3 (Expansion Phase, Part 2).

      This trial is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group
      trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IMU-838 as addition to investigator's choice of
      SoC treatment in patients with COVID-19. Eligible patients will be centrally randomized 1:1
      to twice-daily (BID) oral 22.5 mg IMU-838 (45 mg/day + SoC) or placebo (+ SoC). Randomization
      will be stratified by age (&lt; or &gt;=65 years) and antiviral therapy (no antivirals,
      Hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine, all other antivirals).

      Adaptive sequential trial design and overall trial design

      The trial uses an adaptive sequential design. An IDMC will review unblinded data and provide
      the Sponsor with recommendations regarding modifications of sample size and trial conduct.

      A 1st interim analysis (IA1) will be performed after approximately 200 patients have
      completed the trial (either as scheduled or prematurely), while enrollment continues. If no
      activity of IMU 838 is observed by the IDMC in this IA, further patient enrollment will be
      stopped, and a final analysis of Part 1 will be performed (FA1). It is expected that the
      final analysis of Part 1 will include approximately 230 patients. If the IA1 results indicate
      activity of IMU-838 in COVID-19, the trial may be extended to Part 2 with a revised sample
      size derived by the IDMC based on IA1 results and with possible other trial adjustments. If
      the trial is extended into Part 2, a 2nd IA (IA2) is planned after approximately two-thirds
      of patients (based on the overall global sample size [Part 1 and Part 2 combined]) have been
      enrolled to potentially adjust sample size and other trial features if needed. The final
      analysis of the trial (FA2) will then be done after all patients have completed Part 2.

      In addition, an early interim safety analysis will be performed and evaluated by the IDMC
      after 30 patients have been enrolled to assess unblinded safety data. Further safety analyses
      can be initiated at any time by the IDMC or Sponsor when new safety signals are identified
      within this or other trials of IMU-838.

      Screening

      Patients can be screened for a maximum of 2 days (from Day -2 to Day 0) and eligible patients
      will be randomized on Day 0 and treated with IMP + SoC for 14 days. It is encouraged to
      screen potential participants immediately at the day of hospitalization (including informed
      consent, assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria, screening laboratory tests all done
      locally, assessment of clinical and blood gas criteria) and randomize patients on the same
      day (Day 0). To assess eligibility criteria, existing local laboratory values obtained within
      48 hours of randomization can also be used, except for testing of positive status of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection where a 4-day window is allowed.

      IMP administration should start as quickly as possible after randomization and first IMP
      intended to be given in the evening of the screening day (Day 0).

      Blinded Treatment period (Day 0 to Day 13) and Day 14 (end-of-treatment)

      The first dose of IMP (2 tablets) should always be given on Day 0 (allowed range for first
      dose: 12:00 noon on Day 0 to 02:00 a.m.). All further IMP doses are 1 tablet each in the
      morning and evening. Information about the status and patient care are continuously obtained
      and documented once or twice daily.

      After the last IMP dose in the evening of Day 13, the end-of-treatment assessments will be
      done on Day 14. Blood sampling for IMU-838 trough values must be performed in the morning
      around the time the morning dose was usually taken by the respective patient. Patients may
      then continue to receive SoC without any further restrictions on concomitant medications as
      during the 14-day BT period .

      Day 28 Visit (EoS)

      The patient should return for the final trial visit on Day 28 (EoS). If IMP is prematurely
      discontinued for any reason, the EoS visit should always be conducted on Day 28 and no
      earlier EoS should be performed. If patients withdraw from IMP prematurely, they should be
      encouraged to allow the EoS visit as part of the follow-up. If the patient dies during the
      trial, the investigator should indicate that this visit was not performed. However, even if
      no EoS visit was performed, information about patient status should be reported on the EoS
      page in the case report form. If the patient refuses any EoS visit or the patient is lost to
      follow-up, it is permissive in this trial that the investigator contacts the patient, the
      family of the patient or the referring physician by phone or email to obtain status of life
      information, or is able to search in registers or publicly available information for such
      status of life information.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients at least 18 years old (may be extended to include also
             children 12 years or older after the 1st interim analysis)

          2. Admitted to the hospital or other medical in-patient treatment facility for treatment
             of COVID-19 The hospitalization needs to be for medical reasons (treatment of COVID-19
             disease) and cannot be for social reasons or due to housing insecurity.

             For US sites only: If the investigator would commonly hospitalize the patient but for
             healthcare resource reasons decides to treat the patient in a specially designed
             out-patient setting, then such patients are also allowed to enter the trial (please
             note that in this case the patient would be counted as clinical status category 3).
             The investigator then must assure that the patient has at least a twice daily
             assessment by qualified trial personnel and all laboratory assessments can be
             adequately performed as per protocol. The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue
             this option via administrative letter if such assurances cannot be met by any site.

          3. SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
             (RT-PCR) test in a nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal or respiratory sample at ≤4 days
             before randomization

          4. Moderate COVID-19 disease defined as fulfilling clinical status category 3 or 4 on the
             WHO 9-point ordinal scale [21]:

                  therapy with the following conditions:

               -  The hospitalization needs to be for medical reasons (treatment of COVID-19
                  disease) and cannot be for social reasons or due to housing insecurity

               -  Category 4: Hospitalized, virus-positive, oxygen by mask or nasal prongs
                  (excluding high-flow oxygen therapy) with the following conditions:

               -  Peripheral capillary oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2) &gt;92% at maximum of 6 liters
                  oxygen flow per minute

               -  Stable respiratory rate ≤30 breaths/min at maximum of 6 liters oxygen flow per
                  minute

          5. Presence of at least 1 symptom characteristic for COVID-19 disease i.e., fever, cough

             control (failure rate less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly)
             together with a barrier method between trial consent and 30 days after the last intake
             of the IMP.

             Highly effective forms of birth control are those with a failure rate less than 1% per
             year and include:

               -  oral, intravaginal, or transdermal combined (estrogen and progestogen containing)
                  hormonal contraceptives associated with inhibition of ovulation

               -  bilateral tubal occlusion

               -  vasectomized partner (i.e., the patient's male partner underwent effective
                  surgical sterilization before the female patient entered the clinical trial and
                  is the sole sexual partner of the female patient during the clinical trial)

               -  sexual abstinence (acceptable only if it is the patient's usual form of birth
                  control/lifestyle choice; periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation,
                  symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal are no acceptable methods of
                  contraception)

             Barrier methods of contraception include:

               -  Condom

               -  Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal
                  gel/film/cream/suppository

          9. Male patients must agree not to father a child or to donate sperm starting at
             Screening, throughout the clinical trial and for 30 days after the last intake of the
             IMP. Male patients must also

               -  abstain from sexual intercourse with a female partner (acceptable only if it is
                  the patient's usual form of birth control/lifestyle choice), or

               -  use adequate barrier contraception during treatment with the IMP and until at
                  least 30 days after the last intake of the IMP, and

               -  if they have a female partner of childbearing potential, the partner should use a
                  highly effective contraceptive method as outlined in inclusion criterion 8

               -  if they have a pregnant partner, they must use condoms while taking the IMP to
                  avoid exposure of the fetus to the IMP

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Underlying disease-related exclusion criteria

          1. Involvement in the trial is not in the patient's best interest according to the
             investigator's decision, including the presence of any condition that would, in the
             assessment of the investigator, not allow the protocol to be followed safely Note: The
             investigator should particularly consider exclusion of patients at increased risk for
             serious or fatal AEs in case of worsening of the pulmonary perfusion. This includes,
             but is not limited to, pre-existing pulmonary hypertension, severe chronic respiratory
             disease, severely increased risk for thromboembolic complications and moderate to
             severe left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) dysfunction. In addition, other known
             risk factors of highest risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients should be considered.

          2. Presence of respiratory failure, shock, and/or combined failure of other organs that
             requires ICU monitoring in the near foreseeable future

          3. Critical patients whose expected survival time &lt;48-72 hours

          4. Presence of the following laboratory values at screening:

             concomitant conditions during ongoing SARS-CoV-2 infection)

          7. Anticipated transport to a different hospital or institution, in particular when such
             transport is anticipated for pending ECMO or RRT treatment
