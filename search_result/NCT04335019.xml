  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recent pandemic due to the SARS-CoV2 results in a pulmonary infection in major
      symptomatic patients. Because of the large number of patients and the risk of acute
      respiratory distress syndrome (which seems to occur in almost 5% of patients), there is a
      real challenge to improve physician ability to screen between patients those who will require
      specific surveillance and those who can be sent back home. The recent French official
      recommendation of the French radiology society prescribe that chest X-ray do not have any
      place in the COVID-19+ management whereas the WHO stipulate that ultrasound machines may be
      useful for these patients [1-2]. Moreover, scattered recent publications tend to stress the
      interest of quick ultrasound imaging for COVID-19 suspected patients for screening purpose
      [2-5].

      The aim of this observational historico-prospective study is to assess the risk of severe
      clinical outcomes (admission in continuous care unit (USC), invasive respiratory assistance,
      death) in patients suspected or diagnosed COVID-19+ as a function of initial pulmonary
      ultrasound abnormalities. These clinical outcomes are assessed through phone calls at D5,
      D15, M1.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  Assessing the concordance between the severity of pulmonary lesions as detected by
           pulmonary ultrasound devices and the ones detected by CT-scanner, for patients who will
           undergo these two examinations.

        -  Assessing the compared performances in detecting ultrasound pulmonary lesions for
           patients suspected or diagnosed COVID-19+, between an experimented operator and a newly
           trained operator.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The practitioners involved at each site are

        -  either emergency physicians who are experts in pulmonary ultrasound

        -  either newly trained doctors who have received 30 minutes quick training in the
           fundamentals of pulmonary ultrasound.

      The data collected under this protocol consists in:

        -  data from clinical examination: blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate,
           saturation, signs of confusion, body temperature, calculation of the CRB65 and qSOFA
           score, date of onset of symptoms

        -  Former patient journey: home, hospital, nursing home, others

        -  Medical background

        -  Recent use in the context of NSAID symptomatology

        -  Long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the context of a known
           pathology

        -  Results and date of PCR-Covid-19 test

        -  Pulmonary ultrasound results: quotation in 8 fields (right antero-superior, left
           antero-superior, right antero-inferior, left antero-inferior, right postero-superior,
           left postero-superior, right postero-inferior and postero-upper left).

        -  The operator's identity and level of expertise will be indicated.

      Patients follow-up happens at D5, D15 and D28 through phone call. After verifying their
      identity using the initials entered and their date of birth, the patient or the referring
      person in the medical file is asked where the patient is currently (home, non ICU department,
      ICU department) and whether the patient is in respiratory assistance (invasive or not). In
      the event of notification of death, the date of occurrence will be indicated.

      Patients are informed orally (in the event of altered state of consciousness, their close
      relative present will benefit from this information) that they will be contacted remotely (at
      D5, D15 and D28) to inquire about their development.

      Patients are also informed:

        -  that any new information arising during the participation to the study, which could
           possibly modify his non opposition to this very participation, will be given

        -  of the right to have communication of information, held by the investigators, concerning
           their health, during or at the end of the research.

        -  Results of the chest scanner: typical COVID-19 and extent of the damage (minimal,
           moderate, severe)

        -  Initial patient orientation: return home, simple hospitalization or continuous care unit
           (USC), with or without respiratory assistance (and of what type: invasive or
           non-invasive), death (date of death)

        -  Whether or not to take chloroquine (on D0, D5, D15 or D28)

        -  Patient follow-up: same data as during the initial orientation on day 0, day 5, day 15
           and D28.
