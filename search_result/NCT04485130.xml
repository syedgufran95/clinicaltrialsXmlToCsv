  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disulfiram a safe, easily dosed, FDA-approved drug for the treatment of alcohol dependence
      has been identified to be a potential therapeutic target for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Disulfiram
      may have both antiviral (inhibiting viral replication via blocking the Mpro protease and zinc
      ejection) and anti-inflammatory effects (via inhibition of NF-kB-induced and NLRP
      inflammasome-induced cytokine release) on SARS-CoV-2. We will test disulfiram 2000 mg/day for
      3 consecutive days (doses shown to be well tolerated and safe in a recent phase 2b trial) in
      60 symptomatic COVID PCR+ individuals in a randomized (1:1) clinical trial evaluating the
      effect on COVID symptoms severity, SARS-CoV-2 viral load, and biomarkers of inflammation over
      31 days.

    <textblock>
      The identification of a safe, effective treatment for individuals with early mild-to-moderate
      symptomatic COVID-19 that prevent progression to more severe disease would have immediate
      public health implications. A hallmark of severe COVID-19 disease is immune system
      dysregulation called cytokine storm. Multiple studies have reported that patients with severe
      disease demonstrate elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines early in disease, and
      elevated IL-6 plasma concentrations are predictive of poor clinical outcomes in COVID-19.
      Disulfiram, an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of alcohol dependence disorder is an
      appealing therapeutic option for COVID-19. It has a good safety profile, easy dosing
      schedule, and recent data suggesting multiple mechanisms by which disulfiram may act on
      COVID-19 (both as a direct antiviral agent as well as indirect effects on reducing
      inflammation). In addition disulfiram has been studied extensively with detailed available
      pharmacokinetic data; disulfiram has a short half-life ~7.5 hours with &gt;90% of drug
      eliminated within 3 days post-dose, allowing quick reversal of any potential adverse effects.
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled assessment of disulfiram in people with early
      mild-to-moderate symptomatic COVID-19. Disulfiram 2 grams or a placebo will be administered
      orally once daily for 3 consecutive days. Sixty (N=30 mild, N= moderate/severe) symptomatic
      COVID PCR+ participants will be randomized (1:1) to receive active drug versus placebo.
      Subsequent stratified analyses will be performed based on upper limit of normal hs-CRP,
      ferritin, D-dimer levels. Drug/placebo will be administered using strict infection control
      protocols designed to support the study of people with acute COVID-19 infection per the
      Center for Diseases Control (CDC) guidelines
      (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html).
