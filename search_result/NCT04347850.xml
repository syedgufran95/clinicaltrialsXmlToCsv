  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SARV-CoV-2 infection was considered pandemic on March 11, 2020. The SARV-CoV-2 epidemic
      affected France from the beginning of March, spreading in particular from a 4-day large
      evangelical meeting of 2500 people on February 17 in the city of Mulhouse (North East of
      France). The Montpellier University Hospital has set up a clinical pathway for people
      suspected of being infected with SARV-CoV-2 because of signs compatible with pneumonia
      (screening criteria in France during the study period). This includes an emergency
      department, an infectious disease department dedicated to the surveillance of infected people
      requiring hospital treatment, and an intensive care unit for the most severe cases. The
      diagnosis of infection with SARV-CoV-2 was confirmed in approximately 20% of people initially
      referred in this special care system.

      The main objective of this cohorte is the collection of clinical data and biological samples
      from care for non-interventional research on the patients with a possible or confirmed
      SARS-CoV -2 infection, from diagnosis to long-term follow-up.
