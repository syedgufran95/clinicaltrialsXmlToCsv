  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-phase multicenter study that will be conducted in collaboration with five
      university hospitals, in order to offer telehealth services at home in patients with
      COVID-19, after hospital discharge.

      At the first phase an observational study aims to investigate the physical and psychological
      status of patients after hospital discharge and to provide support and information how to
      cope with symptoms (early fatigue, muscle weakness, eating difficulties, etc).

      At the second phase a randomized control trial study will evaluate a 6-month
      telerehabilitation program for 100 adults (aged 20-65 years) diagnosed with COVID-19, who
      completed the first phase of this study. At this phase, the study will randomize (1:1
      allocation) 100 male and female who were hospitalized with COVID-19 to either a 24-week
      home-based telerehabilitation program versus usual care. The intervention program includes
      individualized prescribed endurance exercises, low intensity aerobic exercises, upper and
      lower extremity strength training, breathing exercises as well as a three times per month
      online support with 1:1 supervision via video conferencing with an expert physiotherapist.

      This is a two-phase multicenter study that will be conducted in collaboration with five
      university hospitals in order to offer home telehealth services in patients with COVID-19,
      after hospital discharge.

      At the first phase, an observational study aims to investigate the physical and psychological
      status of patients after hospital discharge and to provide support and information how to
      cope with symptoms (early fatigue, muscle weakness, eating difficulties, etc).

      We aim to support 200 patients with age 20-65 years, between a 1-8 week period after hospital
      discharge, providing an e-book with body exercises, breathing exercises and nutritional
      support, additionally to four telehealth consultation sessions.

      At the second phase, a single blinded randomized control trial study will evaluate a 6-month
      home telerehabilitation program for 100 diagnosed with COVID-19 adults (aged 20-65 years),
      who completed the first phase of this study. The second phase will randomize (1:1 allocation)
      100 male and female who were hospitalized with COVID-19 to either a 24-week home-based
      telerehabilitation program versus usual care.

      The intervention includes individualized prescribed upper and lower extremity endurance
      exercises, aerobic exercises, upper and lower extremity strength training, breathing
      exercises as well as a three times per month online support with 1:1 supervision via video
      conferencing with an expert physiotherapist.

      The usual care group will be advised to follow the instructions of the e-book for any
      possible exercise training. Three times per month with 1:1 video conferencing, an expert
      physiotherapist will record any possible exercise with no further recommendations or support.

      Changes from baseline in physical activity levels, cardiorespiratory fitness, physical
      performance, lower limb strength, anxiety and depression and health-related quality of life
      will be assessed at 3 and 6 months for both groups. All functional tests in the second phase
      of the study will be performed via supervision teleconference for all the participants with
      an expert physiotherapist. Findings from this project will contribute to the field of
      telerehabilitation in patients with COVID-19 after hospital discharge and will provide
      critical preliminary data for the design and implementation of a larger, randomized control
      trial assessing the impact of telerehabilitation on long-term clinical outcomes following
      infection or re-infection from coronaviruses.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Change From Baseline in SPPB Scores at 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) is comprised of 3 tasks: a standing balance test (side by side, semi-tandem and tandem), a 4-m habitual gait speed, and 5 sit to stand from a chair. Each task is scored (based on time) from 0-4 points. The total score is 12 points and this represents the highest performance. It can be easily performed at home via video conferencing</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiorespiratory fitness</measure>
    <time_frame>Change From Baseline in 3MST Scores at 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 3 minute step test (3MST) is a field test designed to measure aerobic (cardiovascular) fitness. Participants step up and down a 30-cm high step for 3 minutes at a pace of 24 steps per minute. Oxygen saturation, heart rate and fatigue (using the Borg 0-10 scale) will be assessed at the beginning, at the end and every minute after full recovery in order to evaluate the heart's, fatigue and saturation recovery rates. Because it is a submaximal test it can easily be completed at home and administrated via video conferencing.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Lower limb Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Change From Baseline in STST Scores at 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 30 sec sit-to-stand test (STST) is a feasible alternative for measuring lower limb muscle strength and endurance. The outcome is the number of times that the participant is able to completely stand up from the chair within 30 seconds.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Related Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Change From Baseline in SF-36 Scores at 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) consists of 36 questions spanning 8 health (physical and mental) domains. The eight domains are: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role and mental health. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. Converging the individual scores into z-score, a standardized score (mean 50) is provided for each domain allowing comparisons between populations. The lower the score the more disability. It is a valid patient-reported survey of health-related quality of life in patient populations and it is responsive to change following therapeutic interventions.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety and Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Change From Baseline in HADS Scores at 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) is a 14-item questionnaire for screening anxiety (7 items) and depression (7 items). Each item is scored from 0-3 (a 4-point severity scale). Highest anxiety or depression score is 21. Patients are defined as having anxiety or depression or both if the score is 8 or more in the each subscale</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change From Baseline in IPAQ Scores at 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) is a frequently used instrument for the evaluation of physical activity (PA). It was developed in order to assess physical activity in adults aged 18-65 years. The greek version of IPAQ, (IPAQ-Gr) sums up moderate, vigorous, walking physical activities over the previous seven-day period and generate a total physical activity score (PAscore), expressed in MET-minutes per week (MET.min.wk-1 ).
Based on the IPAQ scoring procedure, physical activity status is classified into three categories (PAclasses): (1) low PAclass, insufficiently active subjects (total PAscore &lt; 600 MET.min.wk-1); (2) moderate PAclass (total PAscore ≥ 600 MET.min.wk-1 or vigorous PAscore ≥ 480 MET.min.wk-1) and (3) high PAclass (total PAscore ≥ 3000 MET.min.wk-1 or vigorous PAscore ≥ 1500 MET.min.wk-1).</description>
