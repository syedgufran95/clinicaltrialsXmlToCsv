  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During this pandemic period, the goal of the health care system is to optimize the use of
      intensive care services for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, given the frequency of
      complications that can lead to high mortality.

      When patients with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 are admitted to hospital, whether or not
      they are symptomatic, there is currently no method to predict who will progress to
      complications requiring the use of intensive measures in 24-48 hours.

      The body undergoes a systemic adaptation response to severe illness. Elevated cortisol and
      systemic inflammation are two key responses. Along with hypotension, this triad can lead to
      end-organ failure and death in critical illness. In critical illness, serum cortisol is
      dissociated from its tissular activity. We have developed a formula that calculates tissular
      action of cortisol called the cortisol index. It correlates in chronic ambulatory illness,
      and acute illness such as myocardial infarction (manuscript pending). Elevated neutrophil to
      lymphocyte ration (NLR) is a marker of systemic inflammation and predictor of mortality on
      admission to the emergency department. We have confirmed this in a retrospective and
      prospective study (manuscript pending, data available upon request).

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a triage score (STC-19) based on patients'
      biological state at the time of diagnosis, to objectively determine which patients are most
      likely to require intensive medical services within 24-48 hours of presentation of the
      emergency department.

The only available version will be the locked database. With the exception of dates, all data will be made available. Dates will only be collected to verify the quality of the clinical trial execution. They do not add to the clinical question, and may be a means of indirectly identifying patients.
The database will be made available through Mendeley Data. Mendeley Data is an open research data repository accessible online, where researchers can upload and share their research data.
Medical Subject Headings (MESH) terms will be used to describe clinical data. Methodology for calculating the STC-19 score will be provided in the publication.
International standard unit will be used.</ipd_description>
