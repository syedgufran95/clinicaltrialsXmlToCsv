  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 outbreak is having an impact on the well-being of healthcare workers. Previous
      reports on pandemics show that such an impact may last beyond the time of the outbreak.
      Mindfulness-based interventions help healthcare professionals to reduce stress and may foster
      resilience and recovery, although they have never been tested in a context such as the
      current one. This single-arm trial explores the acceptability, safety and usefulness of an
      on-site, brief Mindfulness-based intervention to reduce stress for front line health workers
      during a crisis.
