  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Coronavirus Emergency has severely affected Italian Healthcare National System. This
      event made it necessary to adopt extraordinary containment measures and to allocate
      extraordinary resources in Italian hospitals. In many centers routinely elective surgical
      activity has been decreased or even completely abolished. We believe that this exceptional
      condition is being consequently having a significant impact on surgical training programs.
