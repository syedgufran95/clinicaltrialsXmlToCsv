  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, has derived a pandemic in which its evolution and
      complications depend on the immune capacity of the host. The virus has been characterized by
      presenting an inflammatory cascade, increased by the overproduction of proinflammatory
      cytokines, the decrease in metalloenzymes and also the rapid spread of the virus. There are
      several lines of treatment, however, nutritional treatment only considered a caloric intake.
      For this reason, this study will evaluate the evolution of patients with COVID-19 assisted by
      nutritional support based on supplements such as omega 3, zinc, selenium, vitamin D,
      glutamine, prebiotics, and foods such as spirulina and the effect of this therapy in reducing
      complications and comorbidities. Research question: Will the nutritional support system
      reduce complications in stage III positive COVID-19 patients with comorbidities (type 2 DM,
      SAH, overweight / obesity with BMI &lt;35), with a better benefit than that achieved with the
      conventional nutritional treatment ?. Hypothesis: The nutritional support system will reduce
      the complications of patients with COVID-19 in stage III with comorbidities. General
      Objective: To determine the effect of the use of a nutritional support system on
      complications in patients with COVID-19 in stage III with comorbidities. Methodology: A
      controlled, blinded, randomized clinical trial will be conducted in patients with COVID-19,
      hospitalized at the ISSEMYM Toluca Arturo Montiel Rojas Medical Center, who meet the
      inclusion criteria. The evolution of the group of patients receiving the nutritional support
      system (NSS) and the normal diet implemented by the hospital will be evaluated against the
      group of patients receiving only the diet, using laboratory and cabinet tests during their
      hospital stay. Statistical analysis: for independent groups with normal distribution,
      Student's T will be applied. If the distribution does not meet normality criteria, a Mann
      Whitney U will be performed; Two-way ANOVA will be applied to monitor the groups over time
      with normal distribution. If the distribution does not meet normality criteria, a Friedman
      test will be performed, in both cases post hoc tests will be performed. The results will be
      analyzed using version 8 of the Graphpad Prism software.

      Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by means of a PCR test, who are treated at the ISSEMYM
      Toluca Arturo Montiel Rojas Medical Center, located in Paseo Tollocan, Av. Baja Velocidad km
      575, Barrio de Sta Clara, Toluca de Lerdo, México; both sexes, with the presence of
      comorbidities (type 2 DM, SAH, overweight or obesity BMI &lt;35) and in stage III of the
      disease.

      Consecutive cases. With systematic randomized allocation using a sequence of random numbers
      built with the Excel program divided into two groups. Once the participants have been
      selected, patients and / or family members will be spoken to to explain the protocol and
      obtain the signatures of the letters of informed consent. Once the patients have been
      admitted to the study, the following will be carried out: Confirmatory test of COVID-19 by
      means of PCR, which must confirm the diagnosis to remain the study, complete clinical and
      dietary history, complete blood count, blood chemistry, D-dimer, coagulation times , bleeding
      time and prothrombin time, fibrinogen, serum electrolytes, serum homocysteine levels, serum
      levels of 25 hydroxycholecalciferol, triceps fold and arm circumference,% muscle mass,% fat,
      BMI, weight, height.

      Assignment to the research group will be carried out randomly.

      The follow-up will be carried out daily for 21 days or earlier, if they are discharged from
      the hospital due to improvement in the evolution, at that moment the patient concludes the
      study. The following points will be supervised:

        1. Application and consumption of NSS supplementation as appropriate, recording of all
           information in the files, food diaries of each patient, laboratory studies: QS every
           other day, BH every 3rd day, clotting times every 3rd day, blood gas twice a day,
           D-dimer and fibrinogen every 3rd day, serum electrolytes every other day, serum
           homocysteine every other day, and serum levels of 25 hydroxycholecalciferol every other
           day.

        2. % SpO2, heart rate, respiratory rate.

        3. Clinical evaluation and registration of evacuations.

        4. Taking the triceps fold and arm circumference,% muscle mass,% fat, BMI, weight, height
           every other day.

        5. Average days of hospital stay.

      A descriptive analysis will be carried out for each continuous variable. These variables will
      be expressed as mean ± standard deviation and standard error. It will be done according to
      the distribution of the data; For independent groups with a normal distribution, Student's T
      will be applied. If the distribution does not meet normality criteria, a Mann Whitney U will
      be performed; For the follow-up of dependent groups with normal distribution, two-way ANOVA
      will be applied. If the distribution does not meet normality criteria, a Friedman test will
      be performed, in both cases post hoc tests will be performed, taking into account that a
      significant value of p of &lt; 0.05. The results will be analyzed using version 8 of the
      Graphpad Prism software.
