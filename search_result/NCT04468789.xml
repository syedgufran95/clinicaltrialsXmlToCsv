  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa are implementing a policy of six-month dispensing of
      antiretroviral (ARV) medications for HIV. Under the new guidelines, stable patients can
      receive a six-month supply of ARV medications at once, reducing the number of clinic visits
      required for medication refills. South Africa is considering this policy but has not yet
      adopted it and has requested evidence of its feasibility, effectiveness, and costs to the
      healthcare system and to patients. The decision on whether to implement a six-month
      dispensing policy has become urgent due to the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic, as clinic visits to
      refill prescriptions pose COVID-19 transmission risks to both patients and providers.

      To generate the required evidence, South Africa is implementing a pilot program that will
      allow for a cluster-randomized evaluation of 6-month dispensing. This protocol is for that
      evaluation. It aims to provide supporting evidence to inform future policy and procurement
      decisions by the National Department of Health (NDOH). All interventions will be conducted as
      part of routine care by Department of Health staff.

      In the pilot program, the NDOH will randomize 28 clinics in two provinces 1:1 to receive the
      six month dispensing intervention or continue standard of care, which currently allows for
      2-3 month dispensing. The researchers will assess the patient outcomes of six month
      dispensing, administer a cross-sectional patient questionnaire, conduct semi-structured
      in-depth interviews with care providers and implementers, and estimate the costs to NDOH and
      to patients of six month dispensing. A maximum of 150,545 patients will be followed through
      their medical records and 400 patients and providers will be consented to be interviewed at
      baseline and after 6 months (total maximum sample size = 150,945).

      The overall aims of this study are to assess the uptake and impact of six-month medication
      dispensing (6MMD) on HIV patients' treatment outcomes at public-sector clinics; estimate the
      costs of the intervention; and assess patients' and providers' perspectives on 6MMD. All
      implementation of the interventions and generation of data will be done by the National
      Department of Health and its support partners; this study will evaluate the outcomes.

      The specific objectives of the evaluation are to:

      Objective 1: Among HIV infected patients on antiretroviral therapy who are newly eligible for
      6MMD, assess the uptake of 6MMD among eligible patients, stratified by repeat prescription
      refill strategy. Evaluation questions:

        -  What proportion of patients is eligible for 6MMD?

        -  What proportion of eligible patients choose to enrol in 6MMD?

        -  What proportion of enrolled patients receive more than one consecutive 6-month refill?

      Objective 2: Is six-month dispensing non-inferior to standard of care (two- or three-month
      dispensing) in terms of retention in care and viral suppression? Evaluation questions:

        -  What is the effect of 6MMD on retention compared to standard of care for patients
           eligible for 6MMD?

        -  What is the effect of 6MMD on viral suppression within 6 and 12 months of intervention
           enrollment (intervention patients) or eligibility (comparison patients), compared to
           standard of care for patients eligible for 6MMD?

        -  What is the effect of 6MMD on retention and suppression among all ART patients in a
           clinic, regardless of whether they were eligible for or received 6MMD?

      Objective 3: Is 6MMD more or less acceptable to patients and providers than standard of care?
      Evaluation questions:

        -  What factors influence patient choice to enrol in 6MMD?

        -  To what extent does the risk of COVID-19 influence a patient's decision to enrol in
           6MMD?

        -  What are the barriers and facilitators to implementing 6MMD from the perspective of
           providers?

        -  How has COVID-19 impacted the implementation of 6MMD?

        -  Has there been any task shifting as a result of the implementation of 6MMD?

        -  What was the level of fidelity to the standard operating procedures (SOP) for 6MMD
           implementation?

      Objective 4: What is the cost of 6MMD to providers and patients compared to standard of care.
      Evaluation questions:

        -  How often do 6MMD patients return to facilities for HIV or other health care or to
           collect other chronic medications between scheduled ARV dispensing visits?

        -  What is the average cost to the provider (DOH) per 6MMD patient and for all ART patients
           at the study clinics?

        -  What is the patient cost of ART for those receiving 6MMD compared to standard of care?
