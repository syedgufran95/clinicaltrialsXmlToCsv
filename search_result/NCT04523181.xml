      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, Phase 2, proof of concept study in
      hospitalized patients with mild to moderate pneumonia due to COVID 19. Written informed
      consent must be obtained from all patients during screening. Following completion of all
      screening assessments and meeting of eligibility criteria, patients will either receive
      antroquinonol or placebo for 14 days in combination with SoC therapy per local SoC policies.

          3. Hospitalized with COVID 19 disease (not requiring oxygen therapy [WHO COVID-19
             Clinical Improvement Ordinal Scale, score of 3] or requiring oxygen therapy by mask or
             nasal prong [WHO COVID-19 Clinical Improvement Ordinal Scale, score of 4]).

             Note: Hospitalized patients can also include patients admitted to centers conditioned
             as hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients.

          4. Chest x ray or computerized tomography (CT) scan consistent with mild to moderate
             pneumonia.

          5. Onset of COVID-19 symptoms within 5 days prior to screening.

          6. SARS CoV 2 infection confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test
             (nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, or respiratory samples, not serology testing).

          7. Male patients and female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use
             protocol-specified methods of contraception.

          8. Females patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at
             Screening or pretreatment on Day 1.

          9. Male patients must agree not to donate sperm from the first dose through 90 days after
             the last dose of study treatment; female patients of childbearing potential should
             refrain from donation of ova from Day 1 until 90 days after the last dose of study
             treatment.

         10. Patient is, in the opinion of the investigator, willing and able to comply with the
             study treatment regimen and all other study requirements.

             mechanical ventilation), or 7 (ventilation + additional organ support pressors, renal
             replacement therapy [RRT], ECMO).

          5. Medical history significant for the following pulmonary diseases: lung cancer, cystic

          8. Treatment with other drugs thought to possibly have activity against COVID 19 within 7
             days prior to enrollment or concurrently. Note: remdesivir is allowed if considered

             and CYP2E1 within 14 days or 5 half lives prior to the start of study treatment. Drugs
             with a narrow therapeutic index that are substrates of 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 3A,
             and 2D6 are also prohibited
