  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to determine whether Camostat mesylate reduces SARS-COV-2
      associated coagulopathy. Additional aims are to determine the effect of Camostat mesylate on
      SARS-COV-2 associated myocardial injury, to assess duration of hypoxia or intubation, to
      evaluate the length of intensive care unit and hospital stay, and assess mortality rates.

      The trial is in-patient only. Participants are identified by the hospital physicians and
      house staff, and contacted by research study personnel. Potential participants fulfilling
      inclusion criteria and not fulfilling exclusion criteria who agree to participate and sign
      the informed consent undergo the enrollment process. Ono Pharmaceutical, Japan, will provide
      Camostat mesylate tablets. The Yale New Haven Hospital research pharmacy will receive and
      store the drug within 15-25C range according to protocol storage requirements.

      Microcrystalline Cellulose NF (PH-102) for placebo formulation will be acquired from Fagron.
      Empty gelatin capsules Size 0, for over-encapsulation will be acquired from Fagron. Before
      Ono Pharmaceutical can send the drug, an IND will be obtained from the FDA.

      Principal Investigator and the Yale New Haven Hospital research pharmacy will keep
      accountability records for all investigational products acquired, dispensed, used and
      disposed. Drugs are administered by nurses. There will be no restriction on taking other
      medications, activities or food intake. There are two arms to the study: (a)
      pharmacy-formulated placebo 3 times a day (b) 200 mg Camostat mesylate to be taken three
      times daily. Each arm will have 100 subjects. All patients will receive treatment until
      discharged. Participants will be randomized equally to Camostat mesylate or identical
      appearing placebo using a permuted-block design with variable block size. The actual
      treatment assignment will be concealed from the investigators and the participants. The
      randomization scheme will be generated by the statistical group.

      Participants have the option of refusing study drug. If the participant decides to stop the
      drug or blood drawing he or she would be dropped from the trial.
