  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The exceedingly high mortality rates of severe and critical COVID-19 warrant the
      identification and evaluation of novel therapies that could potentially mitigate the advanced
      disease manifestations. Based on preclinical data from this institution and others, the
      investigators hypothesize that PI3K inhibition with duvelisib could potentially quell
      aberrant hyperactivtation of the innate immune system, preferentially polarize macrophages,
      reduce pulmonary inflammation, and limit viral persistence, thereby improving patient
      outcomes.
