  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Covid-19 has, in a few weeks, made the world tremble: the number of deaths (mainly
      elderly and / or co-morbid) continues to increase, the confinement causes the collapsing of
      the economy and the decline of relationships inter-human. The data are too fragmented and the
      disease too recent to know its repercussions on the 3 million French people who have or have
      had cancer. The investigators would like, in 3 populations: * patients in treatment, * or in
      follow-up and * health personnel, to constitute a large prospective and longitudinal database
      of data: i / serological: humoral response, test performance, monitoring of serum
      immunoglobulin levels , reinfection threshold,…; ii / clinical: incidence, severity,
      mortality and their favorable factors impact of cancer treatment on Covid-19 infection and
      modification of the quality of oncological care in the context. In parallel, on a more
      limited sample of establishments, it will be : * appreciate the economic and functional
      repercussions, * will try to find out about the infection modalities in patients and health
      personnel and * will appreciate the levels of anxiety and depression to which health staff
      are subject.

      The participation of the study will be offered to each patient when they will come to the
      centre (by oncologist, radiotherapist, surgeon, ...). For the health staff, the information
      can be delivered through different channels (posting, mail, mail, intranet...). This will
      make the informed consent available to all staff. Participation will be voluntary: staff who
      have read the information note and wish to participate in the study will have to register on
      the &quot;PAPESCO-01&quot; screening schedule, during which they will sign their consent with the
      occupational physician (or anyone delegated by occupational medicine), then have their first
      sample and complete the various questionnaires.

      The screening of the patients and of the health staff will be done by 2 or 3 techniques
      depending of the results. The first technic is a blood test done at M0 (inclusion), M3, M6,
      M9 and M12 and on demand in case of Covid-19 symptoms (rapid serology (immediate analysis),
      ELISA serology (differed analysis on frozen sample), genotyping of FCGR2A and FCGR3A gens
      (only at M0)). The second technic nasal swab test (RT-PCR) is done only in case of symptoms
      (whatever the result of the minute test is) for the hospitalized patients. The results of the
      tests realised in town will be get back through the questionnaires. The third technic is the
      questionnaires to the patients and the health staff.
