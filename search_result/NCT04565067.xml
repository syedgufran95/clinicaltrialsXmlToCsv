  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The higher death rate from COVID-19 in the older population is associated with low CD8 T cell
      counts in the blood. Researchers want to learn the status of CD8 T cells specific to
      SARS-CoV-2 and their changes with aging and in COVID-19. This may help to identify why
      COVID-19 is particularly lethal in the elderly and help to create an effective vaccine
      against SARS-CoV-2 in the elderly.

      Objective:

      To identify SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8 T cells in humans, and to determine their quantity and
      quality in people who have recovered from COVID-19.

      Eligibility:

      Maryland residents age 18 and older who have tested positive for and recovered from COVID-19.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened by phone. They must be able to provide a copy of their positive
      COVID-19 test result.

      Participants will visit the NIA/Clinical Research Unit. The visit will take about 1 hour.

      Laboratory tests showing a positive COVID-19 result will be verified.

      Participants vital signs will be checked. This will include blood pressure, temperature,
      pulse, and respiration. Height and weight will be measured.

      Participants will have a medical history and medicine review. They will complete a COVID-19
      questionnaire.

      Participants will have blood drawn. They will give a urine sample.

      Participants will give a saliva sample. They will rinse their mouth with water. After about 3
      minutes, they will let saliva pool in the base of their mouth and then spit into a sterile
      container.

      Participants may be asked if they would be willing to return for optional visits at about 4
      months and 1 year later. They will repeat the same laboratory sampling performed at the first
      visit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is to identify epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 that are recognized by CD8 T cells in the
      blood of healthy young and old participants as well as COVID-19 recovered. We will also
      measure general health factors using blood, saliva and urine samples. By analyzing the
      frequency, differentiation, and expansion of these SARS-CoV-2 recognizing CD8 T cells, we
      hope to shed light into the T cell immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and its change with age and
      post-infection.

      To identify SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8 T cells in humans, and to determine their quantity and
      quality in recovered COVID-19 patients.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        In order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the
        following criteria:

          1. Ability of subject to understand the study and stated willingness to comply with all
             study procedures and availability for the duration of the study.

          2. Male or female, aged 18 years or older.

          3. Able to speak and read English.

          4. Willingness and ability to come to the NIA Clinical Research Unit at MedStar Harbor
             Hospital in Baltimore for study procedures.

          5. Proof of positive SARS-CoV-2 testing exhibiting no current clinical symptoms.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:
