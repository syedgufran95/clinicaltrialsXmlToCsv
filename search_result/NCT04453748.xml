  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SAR-Cov-2 infection and its clinical manifestation known as COVID-19 beside the respiratory
      and lung involvement may include the cardiovascular system, the nervous system and the liver.
      In the acute phase of the disease, all of these conditions may be life-threatened. As a
      result, after the acute phase of COVID-19, early complications may be observed, including
      heart, lungs, brain, muscles and liver. A few papers to date have been reported of
      myocarditis, ventricular arrhythmias, post-inflammatory changes in the lung and liver, as
      well as ischemic changes in the brain, diseases of skeletal muscle, which may have adverse
      prognostic effects. Due to the extent of the pandemic, the severity of the complications and
      the expected high complications' prevalence in the early post-recovery period, a study was
      designed to determine the extent of the problem of early complications after COVID-19.
      Complex cardiological, pulmonary, neurological and hepatological diagnostics are planned,
      including laboratory, imaging and functional tests. The results obtained, in addition to
      determining the scale of the problem, will allow the selection of studies that optimally
      identify patients with early complications. The purpose of this procedure is to enable rapid
      treatment of diseases that are complications of SARS-COV-2 infection. An additional aspect
      raised in the project will be the issue of psychiatric disorders (anxiety, depression, post
      traumatic disorders).

      The main three purposes of the study include:

        1. the assessment of prevalence of particular complications after COVID-19.

        2. identification of the demographic and clinical risk factors of COVID-19 complications

        3. determining the diagnostic tests which are sufficient to detect early complications of
           COVID-19
