  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It's an obsevational retrospective/prospective study. Analyzing the evolution of COVID 19
      infection in cancer patients can provide interesting information in the management of these
      patients. For this reason, the purpose of this study is to implement a registry to describe
      and monitor cancer patients affected by COVID 19, the factors that are associated with an
      unfavorable evolution, to develop a strategy for the risk assessment of these patients and
      recommendations. relating to their treatment.

      Particular attention will be paid to patients suffering from urological tumors because the
      treatment followed by the patients would seem to expose them to a greater risk when they are
      infected with coronavirus, furthermore, from the literature it is clear that there may be a
      connection between sex hormones and ACE2 levels in the plasma. In fact, the estrons
      up-regulate the concentration of ACE2 in the circulation and this could be the reason why
      women would seem more protected than men once they contract the coronavirus infection

      Primary objectives:

        -  describe cancer patients with COVID-19 and their clinical course;

        -  identify predictors of the most severe clinical course;

        -  identify prognostic factors; Secondary objectives

        -  Monitor patients with urological tumors with particular attention;

        -  Dosing parameters of inflammation such as IL-6 and IFNα;

        -  Measure the ACE2 levels.

      Patients with oncological pathology who contracted COVID 19 infection from January 1, 2020
      until the WHO declaration of the end of the pandemic will be studied.
