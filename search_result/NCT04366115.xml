  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-ascending dose study of
      AVM0703 administered as a single intravenous (IV) infusion to patients with COVID-19. The
      study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
      single-ascending dosing of AVM0703 in patients with COVID-19.

      Phase 1 The primary objective of the Phase 1 portion of the study is to evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of a single dose of AVM0703 in patients with moderate, or severe,
      immediately life-threatening ARDS due to COVID-19 or Influenza (A or B) infection.

      The secondary objective of the Phase 1 portion of the study is to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of ascending doses of AVM0703.

      The exploratory objective of the Phase 1 portion of the study is to assess potential
      biomarkers indicative of natural killer T (NKT) cell activity and biomarkers predictive of
      response to AVM0703 in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage.

      Phase 2 The primary objective of the Phase 2 portion of the study is to determine the
      potential efficacy of AVM0703 when administered at the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD)/recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in patients with severe or life-threatening COVID-19
      infection.

      The secondary objective of the Phase 2 portion of the study is to gain further information
      about the safety of AVM0703 in patients with severe or life-threatening COVID-19 infection.

      The exploratory objective of the Phase 2 portion of the study is to assess potential
      biomarkers indicative of NKT cell activity and biomarkers predictive of responders to AVM0703
      in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage.
