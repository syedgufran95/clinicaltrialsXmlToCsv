  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For limiting COVID-19 spreading, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended worldwide
      confinement on 2010. In France, unessential institutions were closed on March 14th and
      population confinement was decided on March 17th.

      Quarantine and/or confinement could lead to psychological effects such as confusion, suicide
      ideation, post-traumatic stress symptoms or anger COVID-19 outbreak highlighted a
      considerable proportion of health care workers (HCW) with depression, insomnia, anxiety and
      distress symptoms. In front line, facing the virus with the fear of contracting it and
      contaminate their closest. During previous outbreaks (H1N1, SARS), HCWs have been shown to
      experience such negative psychological effects of confinement as well as work avoidance
      behaviour and physical interaction reduction with infected patients (4-7).

      In France, Covid 19 outbeak led to increase ICU bed capacity with a full reorganization of
      the human resources. Some caregivers were reassigned to newly setup units admitting or not
      Covid-19 patients. In the same time, non-caregivers were also encouraged to work at home
      whenever possible. Thus, every hospital staff member's private and professional life could be
      altered by the Covid-19 outbreak.

      As all these changes in the daily life could induce psychological disturbances, the present
      study was aimed at assessing the acute anxiety level (main objective) of the staff in our
      Tertiary University Hospital, (6300 employees). Secondarily, the self-reported insomnia,
      pain, catastrophism and work avoidance behaviour levels were assessed
