    <textblock>
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has caused mass
      mortality in the last 3 months that necessitates urgent development of new therapeutical
      agents. So far there is no effective anti-viral drug to reduce viral load that has critical
      importance to prevent progress into severe viral pneumonia and systemic hyper inflammation
      state. This project is to offer a biologic agent based on T cell derived exosomes. This is a
      novel approach using our proprietary protocols for drug development. This clinical trial is
      to test the safety and efficacy of this new agent following targeted delivery by metered dose
      inhaler. The project have received proper approvals from the Turkish Ministry of Health and
      Erciyes University, Kayseri Turkey. Turk-Patent Application Number: PCT/TR2020/050302

    <textblock>
      The Covid-19 disease due to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2) has affected millions people and caused thousands of mortality in the world over
      the last 3 months. Clinically, COVID-19 presents with a wide range of disease severity
      ranging from asymptomatic or very mild flu-like symptoms to very severe acute respiratory
      syndrome and multi-organ failure. The severity of COVID-19 correlates with escalating levels
      of systemic inflammation that eventually leads to hyperinflammatory stage resembling
      macrophage activation syndrome and death. Therefore, early intervention is essential to
      prevent progress into respiratory failure that requires reduction of viral load.

      The virus-specific T-cells (VSTs) are body's natural immune defense against various
      disease-causing viruses. Donor originated COVID-19 specific T-cells (CSTC) are in vitro
      activated and expanded by exposing to viral peptide fragments in the presence of natural
      immune stimulant proteins called cytokines. These COVID-19 specific fragment peptides
      activate specific T-cells and stimulate the secretion of potent mediators including IFN gamma
      in forms of exosomes. We propose treatment of COVID-19 patients -who are at early stages of
      pulmonary disease- with CSTC-exomes to control disease progression. This biological agent
      offers universal application without a need for HLA match. Furthermore, exosomes are suitable
      as &quot;off the shelf product&quot; that allows dose titration for personalized treatment.

      The purpose of this single arm open labeled, combined interventional (phase I/II trials)
      clinical trial is to explore the safety and efficiency of inhaled CSTC-exomes in the
      treatment of early stage novel coronavirus (NCV) pneumonia.
