      This study is intended to address whether oral daily vitamin D supplementation reduces
      infection with SARS-CoV-2 in healthy young adults.

      The primary aim of the study is to demonstrate a reduction in 'silent' seroconversion rates,
      consistent with asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2, in a young healthy adult population
      following 24 weeks of taking oral vitamin D supplemented at a dose of 1000 I.U. daily, versus
      matching placebo.

      The secondary aims of this study are to explore:

        1. Any effect on symptomatic illness.

        2. The background 'point' prevalence and subsequent rate of increase in seropositivity for
           SARS-CoV-2 in healthy young adults.

        3. The individual reductions in seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2 over time, and changes in
           seropositivity in a defined young adult population over time.

        4. Where salivary Immunoglobulin A (IgA) may be used to provide an alternative/
           complementary serological method

        5. The effect (if any) of vitamin D supplementation on seroconversion rates stratified by:
           i) level of baseline vitamin D 'deficiency/ insufficiency/ sufficiency' status; ii)
           extent of BMI-defined normal/overweight/obesity cut-offs and iii) gender.

      The primary aim of this study is to demonstrate a reduction in 'silent' seroconversion rates,
      consistent with reduced asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2, in a young healthy adult
      population following 24 weeks of taking oral vitamin D supplemented at a dose of 1000 I.U.
      daily, versus matching placebo. The study will be a Clinical Trial of an Investigational
      Medicinal Product (CTIMP) conducted by intention-to-treat over 24 weeks. It will follow a
      double-blind, randomized design comparing supplementation at a dose of 1000 I.U. vitamin D
      daily versus matched placebo in adults aged 18-30 years old. Participants will be recruited
      in Leeds to start in coincidence with the recommencement of Autumn semester. In accordance
      with our power calculation and anticipated drop-out rate, 2200 volunteers will be recruited
      to the intervention (vitamin D) arm, and 2200 to the placebo arm. Baseline serological
      testing of blood will be conducted to allow exclusion of prior seropositive individuals and
      any necessary upwards adjustment of recruited numbers. Data collected at baseline and
      3-weekly during the remainder of the study will include seroconversion status assessed from a
      validated Dried Blood Spot (DBS) method in conjunction with novel salivary antibody testing,
      plus structured questionnaire responses screening for Covid-19 symptoms. Physical and
      demographic characteristics and serum levels of vitamin D concentrations collected from
      participants at study entry will facilitate secondary aims in relation to exploring the
      influence of gender, ethnicity, body mass and body mass index (BMI) on asymptomatic
      seroconversion, as well as interactions with vitamin D status and supplementation.
