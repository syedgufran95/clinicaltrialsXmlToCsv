  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Morphine is used in the treatment of dyspnea and polypnea with a proven benefit on the
      improvement of these symptoms, both etiologically and symptomatically. This medication is
      used in particular in palliative care for this type of symptom.

      The Sars CoV2 viral pneumonia table can lead to respiratory distress. In patients with
      moderate to severe impairment without goal of resuscitation (level of care 3 and 4), the
      introduction of morphine may sometimes be necessary to relieve respiratory symptoms. These
      also lead to major exhaustion which can worsen the clinical picture. However, the
      prescription of morphine is not systematic in front of a respiratory distress table.

      The investigators hypothesized that early treatment with morphine lead to a better management
      of dyspnea, quality of live and survival in COVID-19 positive participants patients when
      there is not resuscitation objective management (level of care 3 and 4).

      The objective is to measure the efficacy of morphine in the early management of dyspnea,
      quality of life and survival in COVID-19 positive participants patients treated in the
      Hospices Civils of Lyon during COVID-19 pandemic.
