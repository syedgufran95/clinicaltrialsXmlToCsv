  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to reduce COVID-19 related pulmonary complications in adult patients
      undergoing all types of elective or emergency surgery in a COVID-19 exposed environment. A
      Trial in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs) and A Trial in High Income Countries (HICs)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial has an adaptive platform design to identify at the earliest opportunity
      intervention arms which are showing benefit, drop arms which have a clear lack of benefit,
      and rapidly introduce new therapeutic options to the platform. This will enable rapid
      feedback of results to clinicians, allowing the standard of care to be modified as the
      pandemic progresses. Regular and frequent monitoring of results will be guided by an
      experienced, independent DMC.

      Eligible patients will be randomised at the level of the individual in a 1:1:1:1 ratio
      between:

      A. Control (normal practice; neither trial drug) B. Lopinavir 400mg-Ritonavir 100mg by mouth
      every 12 hours for 10 days or until discharge, whichever occurs first C. Hydroxychloroquine
      400mg BD day 1; then 400mg daily day 2-5 or until discharge, whichever occurs first D. Both
      trial drug regimens

    <intervention_model_description>The trial uses a Bayesian adaptive platform design, allowing for termination of arms if their superiority to standard care is established, and addition of new treatment arms. Patients will be randomised 1:1:1:1 to (A) Control (normal practice; neither trial drug), (B) Lopinavir-Ritonavir only, (C) Hydroxychloroquine only, (D) both Lopinavir-Ritonavir and Hydroxychloroquine.</intervention_model_description>
