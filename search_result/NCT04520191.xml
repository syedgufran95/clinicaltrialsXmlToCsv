  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) OR COVID-19 related
      Addition: The aim of this addition activity is to track the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic
      on participants with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). We have modified the original
      HBKC Study protocol to expand data currently collected from study participants to include
      data in the following domains linked to the COVID-19 epidemic:

      symptoms of COVID-19 disease, access to healthcare, and impact on health related behaviors
      (such as medication adherence, physical activity, dietary behaviors, smoking, and alcohol
      use).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will administer a survey by phone or mail to all participants screened for diabetes and
      chronic kidney disease in the original HBKC study protocol. The survey will address to the
      following aims:

      Aim 1. Develop a phone-based and or mail based survey to understand the impact of COVID19 on
      patient-reported outcomes for adults with diabetes and CKD.

      Aim 2. Test the feasibility and acceptability of this phone-based and or mail based survey in
      the HBKC cohort.
