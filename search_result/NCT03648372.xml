    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TAK-981 as
      a single agent in participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors and lymphomas in dose
      escalation and cancer treatment expansions, and to assess change in acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load within 8 days of TAK-981 administration in
      COVID expansion.

      01-Oct-2020 Enrollment of patients into the COVID arm of this study is no longer recruiting.

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-981. TAK-981 is being tested to evaluate
      safety, tolerability, and PK in participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors or
      relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies and in a subset with COVID-19. The study will
      include a dose escalation phase and cancer treatment expansions and COVID-19 expansion.

      The study will enroll approximately 140 participants, approximately 50 participants in the
      dose escalation phase, approximately 15 participants in each of the 2 cohorts of cancer
      treatment expansion phase and approximately 60 participants in the COVID-19 expansion.

      In the dose escalation, dose levels will be escalated based on safety, and available PK and
      pharmacodynamic data. This study will also determine the single agent recommended phase 2
      dose (RP2D). Participants in dose expansion phase will be enrolled, once maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) or biological effective dose (BED) is determined. One of the 2 cohorts in cancer
      treatment expansions will consist of participants with relapsed/refractory lymphomas, and
      other cohort will consist of participants with solid tumors with no standard therapeutic
      option available with established clinical benefit. In the COVID-19 expansion, dose schedule
      can be modified in Safety lead-in if PK, pharmacodynamics, decrease in viral load and safety
      data are supportive. Once the Safety Lead-in is complete and a TAK-981 dose and regimen is
      selected, randomized COVID-19 proof of concept will begin with participants randomized to Arm
      A: COVID-19 standard of care (SOC), or Arm B: COVID-19 SOC + TAK-981.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States and Canada. The overall time
      to participate in this study is approximately 3 years. The overall time to receive treatment
      in the dose escalation and cancer treatment is approximately 1 year and in COVID-19
      expansion, participants will receive 1 cycle of treatment and will be followed for up to 90
      days from enrollment. Based on decision of sponsor, participants with demonstrated clinical
      benefit can continue treatment beyond 1 year. Participants will make multiple visits to the
      clinic, and will make a final visit 30 days after receiving their last dose of drug or before
      the start of subsequent anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first for a follow-up
      assessment.

If TAK-981-related cumulative toxicity is observed or clinical safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics are supportive, the dosing schedule may be modified to evaluate a less intensive administration of TAK-981 on Days 1 and 8 in cycles of 21 days. Dose levels will be escalated based on the safety, and available PK and pharmacodynamics data. The dose expansion phase will evaluate the safety of TAK-981 at the selected MTD/BED from dose escalation phase in two cohorts of participants with solid tumors or lymphomas.</description>

    <description>Covid-19 safety lead-in: TAK-981, intravenously, administered as 60 minute-infusion, once on Days 1 and 4. The starting dose of TAK-981 will be 60 milligram (mg). The initial dosing schedule for COVID-19 expansion cohorts will be for a single cycle with TAK-981 administered on Days 1 and 4. If PK, pharmacodynamics, decrease in viral load and safety data are supportive, the schedule can be modified in Safety Lead-in. A ramp-up schedule of TAK-981, intravenously, administered as 60 minute-infusion, 40 mg on Day 1 and 60 mg on Day 4 may be evaluated.
COVID-19 proof of concept: Once the Safety Lead-in is complete and a TAK-981 dose and regimen is selected by the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC), the randomized COVID-19 proof of concept will begin with participants randomized to Arm A: COVID-19 standard of care (SOC), or Arm B: COVID-19 SOC + TAK-981.</description>

               -  Has histologically confirmed advanced (local regionally recurrent not amenable to
                  curative therapy) or metastatic solid tumors that have no standard therapeutic
                  option with a proven clinical benefit, are intolerant or have refused them, OR

               -  Has relapsed/refractory lymphoma not amenable to therapies with proven clinical
                  benefit or who are intolerant or who refuse them. Participants with low grade
                  lymphomas such as follicular lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma,
                  lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma, and marginal zone lymphomas, may not need to exhaust
                  all available therapy. These participants can be enrolled after failure of at
                  least 2 prior systemic therapies, provided that there is not an immediate need
                  for cytoreduction. In these cases, participants who need immediate therapy for
                  tumor bulk are not eligible for this trial.

               -  Participants enrolled in cancer treatment expansion cohorts will be required to
                  have measurable disease per RECIST version 1.1 for participants with solid tumors
                  or Response Evaluation Criteria in Lymphoma (RECIL) 2017 for participants with

                  COVID-19.

               -  Has peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) &gt;91 percentage (%) on room air
                  at screening.

               -  Has moderately severe disease (NEWS &lt;=6).

               -  Has left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt;=40%; as measured by
                  echocardiogram or multiple gated acquisition (MUGA) scan within the previous 3
                  months. Note: Required for participants with history of significant
                  cardiovascular disease or history of cardiotoxic therapy.

          5. Adequate bone marrow reserve and renal and hepatic function.

          6. Recovered to Grade 1, baseline or established as sequela, from all toxic effects of
             previous therapy (except alopecia, neuropathy, or autoimmune endocrinopathies with

          7. Screening and post-dose tumor biopsies are required from all participants in the
             expansion cohorts and are optional during dose escalation, however once a DLx is
             identified at which there is clear evidence of TAK-981 biological effect (that is,
             observation of peripheral lymphopenia, induction of cytokines/chemokines, type 1
             interferon (IFN) signature in blood, drug-related toxicity or antitumor effect),
             subsequent participants must agree in providing a fresh tumor biopsy during the
             screening period and a second tumor biopsy as requested in the schedule of events
             (SOE). The lesion accessible for biopsy may not be the only target lesion and should
             not be located in a previously irradiated field (unless this index lesion has
             progressive disease &gt;=20% post radiation). Ideally, the same lesion should be biopsied
             before treatment and on treatment whenever possible.

          8. Consented to undergo serial skin punch biopsies (dose escalation only).

          9. Suitable venous access for safe drug administration and the study-required PK and
             pharmacodynamics sampling.

                  treatment period and through 120 days after the last dose of study drug, or

               -  Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and
                  usual lifestyle of the participant. (Periodic abstinence [example, calendar,

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
