      Healthcare workers have been front and center in battling the COVID crisis. This is a
      situation the researchers could never have envisioned before it happened. Of course, this has
      triggered an inordinate amount of stress. Research shows that chronic stress leaves one
      imbalanced and one's health and happiness to suffer. Research has also demonstrated that how
      one thinks about stress determines how the body responds to it. Simple mindfulness practices
      provide healthier ways to deal with stress. In this study, the researchers will introduce
      modified mindfulness practices that can be practiced in the healthcare setting or at home.
      All of the practices are based on mindfulness principles. Mindfulness refers to a state of
      being present in the moment, on purpose, and without judgment. &quot;Mindfulness Based Stress
      Reduction&quot; is an 8 week, 2 hours/week curriculum that has shown results for over 40 years.
      All the practices in this study are adapted from that protocol.

      The intervention includes several mindfulness practices including an awareness of breath
      focus instruction, breath-and-body coordination and awareness instruction, and instruction in
      identifying times to practice these exercises. The intervention will be delivered virtually
      2-day/week, twice/day, for four weeks.

      Effectiveness will be measured by the voluntary, anonymous submission of a Perceived Stress
      Scale, a validated survey tool to determine an individual's perceived stress level.

      Participants will be healthcare workers and hospital staff in the Mount Sinai Hospital
      system.
