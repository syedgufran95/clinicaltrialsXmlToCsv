  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infection with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus strain is associated with severe morbidity and
      mortality estimated today from 2% to 4%. Elderly patients or patients with serious chronic
      conditions justifying hospitalization are particularly at risk. The risk of infection with
      SARS-CoV-2 during hospitalization is also substantial and increased in fragile patients.
      Several cases of infection among Healthcare Professionals had been reported.

      The hypothesis is that similar to the corona virus agent responsible for SRAS and the
      influenza virus, nosocomial outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 to be feared. Health care professionals
      and caregivers are populations-at-risk as they are exposed in the community and can transmit
      SARS-CoV-2 to hospitalized patients, and are also exposed to hospitalized patients infected
      with SARS-CoV-2.

      Describing hospital-acquired cases and SARS-CoV-2 infection transmission chains in healthcare
      settings is vitally essential to achieve control of this epidemic. To improve the quality of
      care and patient safety, this data must be accompanied by an analysis of the impact of
      infection control measures. In addition, an effective infection control program is urgently
      required to control the spread of the virus and protect both uninfected patients who require
      care for other medical or surgical conditions as well as health care professionals.

      The main objective of this prospective, non-interventional - observational, hospital based
      study in adults and children is to describe and document suspected or confirmed cases of
      nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection, the clinical spectrum and the determinants (risk
      factors/protective factors) at participating hospitals.

      Characterization of the clinical features of the SARS-CoV-2 infection will help to identify
      potential sources of virus transmission as rapidly as possible and enable implementation of
      appropriate hygiene practices in hospitals.

    <description>When there is suspicion of a community-acquired case (admission of an infected patient) or nosocomial case (infection of a patient already hospitalized), a case report form including demographic data, medical history, and clinical and biological data on the infectious episode will be completed for each case, either patient, caregivers or health care professionals, presenting clinical signs or symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The suspected cases will undergo nasopharyngeal swab collection and detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs will be done by real-time RT-PCR assay.
Hygiene measures applied by the service will be collected using a questionnaire as well as recommendations of the learned societies within the country regarding the risk of infection by coronavirus. In addition, data characterizing the service and hospital will also be collected (specialty, number of beds, number of nurses, doctors, etc.).</description>

        This study will focus on volunteers, patients, caregivers and health care professionals
        within the participating hospitals associated with the GABRIEL network. Other hospitals,
        including french, will be able to integrate with this project on a voluntary basis.
