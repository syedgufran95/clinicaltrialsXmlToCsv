  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this retrospective clinical epidemiology study is to describe the
      characteristics of Covid-19 cases requiring hospitalization in adult patients with lymphomas
      during the initial phase of the epidemic (from 01/03/20 to 30/04/20).

      The specific objectives are to estimate the frequency of severe forms of Covid-19 and those
      requiring intensive care hospitalisation, as well as the mortality related to the epidemic
      among the active file of patients followed for lymphoma at each study site, to investigate
      whether certain chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy treatments seem to be associated with
      severe forms or prolonged evolutions of Covid-19, to describe possible atypical clinical
      forms among the population of patients treated for lymphoma.

      Methods :

        -  Multicentric retrospective observational epidemiological study based on the collection
           of data from patient records.

        -  Selection of voluntary hospital sites in regions with excess mortality during the
           epidemic phase.

        -  Systematic identification of Covid-19 cases from coding data (PMSI) from the medical
           information departments which will be compared with the numbers of patients followed for
           lymphoma in the haematology departments of each site during the 6 months preceding the
           epidemic, identified through the PMSI.

        -  Establishment of an ad hoc CRF for cases only with collection of clinical data
           concerning lymphoma and Covid-19 and routine biological data: Cytopenia (and in
           particular depth of lymphopenia), hypogammaglobulinemia, inflammatory markers.

        -  Estimated total number of sites: 10-15 and number of cases to be collected: 50-60.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients at least 18 years of age with lymphoma and a diagnosis of Covid-19 requiring
             hospitalization.
