    <textblock>
      ONCOVID is a prospective cohort study investigating oncology-patient-reported anxiety, mood,
      and quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants complete a survey consisting
      of sociodemographic information and self-administered questionnaires (COVID-19 Peritraumatic
      Distress Index, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, and WHO Quality of Life-BREF). Data
      collection occurs at baseline and follow-up surveys are performed after 6, 12, and 24 weeks.
