  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since December 2019, outbreak of COVID-19 caused by a novel virus SARS-Cov-2 has spread
      rapidly around the world and became a pandemic issue. Cancer patients seem to be at higher
      risk of infection and evolution to severe forms related to immunosuppression, according to
      the first published data from Chinese experience. However, the role of confounding factors
      such as age and smoking habits cannot be independently assessed. Supplementary data from a
      large retrospective Italian cohort suggest that the proportion of cancer patients with severe
      form of COVID-19 could be lower than expected. In addition, the proportion of asymptomatic
      SARS-Cov-2 infected cancer patients is unknown. Based on academic and expert's
      recommendations, most of cancer units have already modified cancer treatment during the
      pandemic, in order to limit the number of outpatient visits / inpatient admissions and then
      reduce or avoid cross infection of COVID-19, although the negative impact on patient's
      outcome (cancer recurrence or mortality) has not been established. Thus, a large screening
      for SARS-Cov-2 infection in treated cancer patients could help to: - Define an accurate
      prevalence of COVID-19 immunization in this population - Aggregate data on the relationship
      between clinical characteristics in cancer patients and COVID-19 risk. - Provide information
      about asymptomatic COVID-19 cases. - Organize effectively cancer units to separate infected
      and non-infected patients.

      The RT-PCR gold-standard test for COVID-19 on nasal and pharyngeal swabs has limitations, as
      the test is not universally available, turnaround times can be lengthy, and reported
      sensitivities vary. It does not provide information about immunization status. Serological
      assays may be important for understanding the epidemiology of emerging SARS-Cov-2, including
      the burden and role of asymptomatic infections. Thus, the development of new devices or
      techniques for accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections, of fast and safe use, that could
      be spread in the local hospitals and clinics, would be a major advance for identifying and
      treating patients. In addition, information about the immunization of fragile people, such as
      cancer patients, could help to plan a safe strategy for anti-cancer treatment schedule and
      for the end of quarantine.
