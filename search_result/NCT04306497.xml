    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center cross-sectional syndrome investigation study, taking confirmed cases
      as the main observation object, A prospective multicenter cohort study was designed, focusing
      on the common type with the largest number of confirmed cases, to evaluate the intervention
      effect of this project in relieving the disEvaluation of the efficacy and safety of TCM
      differential treatment of COVID-19 inease and preventing disease progressio.

      According to the actual situation of receiving treatment, if the subjects received the
      combination of western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine, it was the exposure group
      (integrated traditional Chinese and western medicine cohort), and if the subjects only
      received western medicine treatment, it was the control group (western medicine cohort). The
      choice of treatment for patients is entirely determined by clinicians according to the
      patient's condition, and patients are free to choose after fully understanding different
      schemes).The choice of control group: COVID-19 (common type) who received routine treatment +
      antiviral therapy；The choice of exposure group: COVID-19 (common type) who received routine
      treatment + TCM.The sample size is tentatively set at 340.
