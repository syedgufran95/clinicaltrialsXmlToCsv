  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The leading cause of death in patients with COVID19 is a severe inflammatory response caused
      by a cytokine storm that results in acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute pulmonary
      insufficiency, as well as dysfunction of several vital organs. Therefore, preventing the
      occurrence of uncontrolled inflammation is the main goal of the ongoing clinical trials.
      Chloroquine and tocilizumab, which have the best results, are also prescribed to control
      inflammation. But it can be said that treatments are the main source of inflammation.
      Inflammasome NLRP3 is one of the mechanisms involved in many severe inflammatory disorders.
      Inflammatory activation has already been demonstrated by many viruses. Melatonin, on the
      other hand, is a hormone in the body that can inhibit Inflammation NLRP3 in addition to
      various anti-inflammatory effects, especially after severe inflammation. Older adults with
      lower levels of melatonin and children with maximum levels of melatonin are the risk groups
      and low-risk groups for the disease, respectively. In the present study, while measuring
      melatonin in patients with COVID19, its effectiveness as a treatment method along with the
      common antiviral drug regimen in patients with severe disease will be evaluated.
