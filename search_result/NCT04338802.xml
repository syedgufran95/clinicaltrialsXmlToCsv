      This center intends to conduct a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled study to
      evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Nintedanib ethanesulfonate soft capsule in the
      treatment of pulmonary fibrosis in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. The number of
      cases is estimated based on the following:

      This exploratory trial is expected to complete 80 case studies (randomly divided into control
      group and test group each with 40 cases), and the expected drop-out rate is not more than
      20%, so the total number of cases is 96. Placebo control group:

      Empty capsules with the same appearance and ingredients as Nintedanib soft capsules: one
      capsule at a time, twice a day, with an interval of about 12 hours each time. Continuous
      medication for 8 weeks.

      Nintedanib Nintedanib cloth sulfonate soft capsule treatment: According to the drug manual
      recommendation, give Nintedanib cloth sulfonate soft capsule 150mg twice daily with an
      interval of about 12 hours each time, with food. Continuous medication for 8 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 18-70 years old (including 18 and 70 years old), regardless of gender;

          2. Infection with new coronavirus pneumonia was confirmed by throat swab nucleic acid
             test. Patients with severe and critical illness were clinically judged. The symptoms
             of acute infection have been alleviated after treatment (at least 14 days after onset,
             no fever for more than 3 days), and the disease is recovering Within three months;

          3. CT examination of patients with multiple fibrotic shadows in both lungs;

          4. Blood routine, liver, and kidney functions are within the controllable range: such as
             the normal upper limit of plasma total bilirubin and creatinine ≤ 1.5 times; AST, ALT,
             LDH ≤ 2 times the normal upper limit; sufficient hematopoietic function: such as white
             blood cells ≥4.0 × 109 / L, platelets ≥100 × 109 / L;

          5. Signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous history of chronic bronchitis, emphysema, interstitial lung disease or
             pulmonary heart disease;

          2. Combining with other serious diseases: such as those who have suffered myocardial
             infarction and uncontrollable diabetes within 6 months, and are considered unsuitable
             to participate in the trial;

          3. People with active peptic ulcer;

          4. Patients during pregnancy and lactation
