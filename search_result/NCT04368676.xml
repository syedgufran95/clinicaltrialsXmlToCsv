  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the feasibility of conducting an online Randomized Controlled Trial
      (RCT) in frontline hospital and long term care healthcare staff in managing COVID-19 patients
      in London, ON. The study will randomize participants to Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) or a
      Health Enhancement Program (HEP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic continues to escalate as a global health threat, leading to devastating
      impacts on the healthcare system. Frontline healthcare workers are dealing with increased
      demands and fears for their own, as well as their family's safety. Adding to the stress is
      the limited ability to maintain social connectedness as physical distancing measures are in
      place. The investigators plan to conduct an open-label feasibility randomized controlled
      trial (RCT), comparing an online breath based yogic intervention called Sudarshan Kriya Yoga
      (SKY) (n=30) versus an online control mind-body intervention called the Health Enhancement
      Program (HEP) (n=30) in 60 hospital and long term care frontline staff that are managing
      COVID-19 patients. Participants will be blinded to the treatment hypothesis while data
      analyst will be blinded to treatment allocation. Both SKY and HEP will be taught online in
      two phases in the first week followed by weekly reinforcement sessions for the following 4
      weeks. Feasibility measures will be assessed as well as self-rated measures of insomnia,
      anxiety, depression, and resilience. The investigators expect that it will be feasible to
      conduct an online RCT of two mind-body interventions, SKY and HEP, in staff managing the
      COVID-19 pandemic, and that the investigators will be able to remotely monitor safety and
      efficacy of these interventions.

    <description>The Athens Insomnia Scale will be used to assess insomnia. This scale is an 8-item, self-rated measure of the extent of sleep difficulties over the last 30 days with each item representing a different aspect of sleep (e.g. &quot;Overall Quality of Sleep&quot;). Ratings are from 0 to 4, with 0 being no difficulty with the item and 4 being the most difficulty with the item. Higher overall scores on this scale indicate higher difficulties with sleep.</description>

    <description>The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (each scored 0-3) is a self-rated measure of anxiety and has been validated for the diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder in the adult population. Scores range from 0 to 21. Higher scores indicate greater anxiety symptoms (5-9, mild anxiety; 10-14, moderate anxiety; 15-21 severe anxiety).</description>

    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is a 9-item, self-rated measure of depression which has been validated for screening a major depressive episode in adults. Total scores indicate various levels of depression: 0-4, no depression; 5-9, mild depression; 10-14, moderate depression; 15-19, moderately severe depression; 20-27, severe depression.</description>

    <description>The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) is a brief self-rated assessment tool that comprises of 10 items, each rated on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = not true at all to 4 = true nearly all the time). Higher scores reflect greater resilience, which is a measure of one's ability to cope with stress. The scale demonstrated strong reliability and validity and has been studied in a variety of populations including medical personnel, nurses, social workers and physicians).</description>

    <description>Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) will be delivered using the Hospital approved Cisco WebEx platform. The online version of SKY will be delivered by at least one certified Canadian SKY teacher, with at least one back up teacher, under the supervision of Ms. Ronnie Newman, Director of Research and Health Promotion, Art of Living Foundation, USA. The online version of SKY for healthcare workers has a total duration of 3 hours. Phase I will consist of 5 self-paced online modules of 4-10 minutes each to learn the breath control techniques. In Phase II, 2 interactive online sessions of 1 hour each will be held on consecutive days with a certified SKY teacher, during which participants will learn the fast, medium and slow breaths. For ease of scheduling, multiple time windows will be offered for Phase II. Phase I and Phase II will be completed in the first week of the trial. Weekly follow up sessions will be offered to participants for 30 minutes each for 4 weeks in both study arms.</description>

    <description>The Health Enhancement Program (HEP) will be delivered using the Hospital approved Cisco WebEx platform. The active control arm, HEP, will consist of time-matched online self-paced modules for Phase I, comprised of de-stressing guided exercises such as gentle stretch and yoga asanas and progressive muscle relaxation. Phase II will consist of mindfulness-based meditation sessions delivered by Dr. Paris Lai, co-investigator and senior psychiatry resident, and backed up by Ms. Victoria Mills and Ms. Kasha Herba, MSWs, mental health social workers. They all have previous research experience in our Geriatric Mood Disorders Lab. They will be supervised by the PI and Dr. Imants Baruss to deliver the HEP intervention. Weekly follow up sessions will be offered to all recruited participants for 30 minutes each for 4 weeks in both study arms.</description>
