  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV2 has become a pandemic disease putting an enormous burden on health care systems
      around the world. A considerable amount of patients require intensive care treatment for
      Covid-19 associated pneumonia. At this point there is no specific treatment, apart from
      supportive intensive care treatment protocols for severe COVID-19 disease.The latest reports
      describe massive hyperinflammation in some of the severe COVID-19 patients, which is not a
      typical finding in virus associated pneumonia. The H-score and the modified HLH 2004 score
      offer diagnostic tools, that help establishing the diagnosis of HLH. Even more important is
      the expert clinical judgment to establish the diagnosis of sHLH.

      SARS-CoV2 has become a pandemic disease putting an enormous burden on health care systems
      around the world. The course of disease is relatively mild in most of the patients, but there
      is a considerable amount of patients that require intensive care treatment for Covid-19
      associated pneumonia. At this point there is no specific treatment, apart from supportive
      intensive care treatment protocols for severe COVID-19 disease.The latest reports describe
      massive hyperinflammation in some of the severe COVID-19 patients. The H-score and the
      modified HLH 2004 score offer diagnostic tools, that helps establishing the diagnosis of HLH.
      Moreover expert clinical judgment is key to establish a diagnosis of sHLH. Still, so far no
      systematic analysis has been carried out answering the question as to whether or not these
      patients suffer from secondary HLH and could potentially benefit from immunomodulatory drugs.
