      Background:

      COVID-19 is a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It infects the respiratory tract. Some
      people who get COVID-19 have only mild symptoms. But for others, infection leads to
      pneumonia, respiratory failure, and, in some cases, death. Researchers want to learn more
      about any effects that may persist after people recover from COVID-19.

      Objective:

      To learn about any long-term medical problems that people who have recovered from COVID-19
      might have, and whether they develop an immune response to SARS-CoV-2 that provides
      protection against reinfection.

      Eligibility:

      People age 18 and older who have recovered from documented COVID-19 or were in close contact
      with someone who had COVID-19 but did not get the infection

      Design:

      Participants will be screened over 2 visits. During visit 1, they will answer questions about
      any symptoms they are having and will be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection which will involve a
      nasal swab sample or other FDA approved test. If the test is negative, they will proceed to
      the second visit, which will include:

      Physical examination

      Medical history

      Mental health interview (which may be recorded if the participant agrees)

      Chest x-ray (for recovered COVID-19 participants only)

      Blood and urine tests

      Pregnancy test (if needed)

      Lung function test (for recovered COVID-19 participants only)

      6-minute walk test (for recovered COVID-19 participants only)

      Questionnaires about their general and mental health

      Leukapheresis to collect white blood cells (optional).

      Participants will be put into 1 of 2 groups: the COVID-19 group or the close contact group.

      Participants will have study visits every 6 months for 3 years. They will repeat some of the
      screening tests. Participants in the COVID-19 group may have visits more often if they
      develop symptoms that suggest re-infection with SARS-CoV-2....

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a newly recognized viral disease primarily involving
      the respiratory tract. The world is currently experiencing COVID-19 pandemic with a
      significant portion of those infected developing severe disease manifestations including
      pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome with respiratory failure, and, in some cases,
      death. The clinical characteristics and spectrum of disease severity of acute COVID-19 are
      currently being defined. Since COVID-19 is a new disease, very little is known about possible
      clinical sequelae that may persist after resolution of the acute infection. In addition, the
      characteristics of the initial cellular immune and antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 (the virus
      that causes COVID-19) have not been fully defined and it is not known if the immune responses
      generated by infection provides long-term protective immunity. The purpose of this study is
      to establish a longitudinal cohort that has recovered from COVID-19 and characterize the
      clinical sequelae of acute infection, characterize the immune response to the virus, and
      follow the evolution of the immune response over time and determine the extent to which
      natural immunity is protective against re-infection.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        In order to be eligible to participate in this study, all individuals must meet all of the
        following criteria:

          1. Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the
             duration of the study

          2. Age 18 years or older.

          3. Ability of participant to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed
             consent document.

          4. Hemoglobin of 9.0 gm/dl or higher

          5. Willingness to give consent for the storage of blood samples for research.

          6. Have a physician or clinic outside NIH to manage underlying medical conditions or
             agreeing to establish care with an outside physician or clinic for any medical
             conditions requiring treatment that may be diagnosed as a result of protocol
             participation.

        COVID-19 Survivor Group

          1. Documented prior COVID-19 as evidenced by:

               1. detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen in nasopharyngeal swab, sputum or other
                  sample source with EUA/approval from the FDA; or

               2. a positive antibody test using an assay that has received emergency use
                  authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a history
                  clinical manifestation compatible with COVID-19.

          2. Greater than 6 weeks since onset of COVID-19 symptoms and no fever for at least 1
             week. For individuals with asymptomatic infection, screening will not occur until at
             least 4 weeks after the last positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antigen test.

        COVID-19 Close Contact

          1. Living in the same household as a COVID-19 survivor during the time of illness or,
             being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period
             of time or having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g.,
             being coughed on).

          2. No diagnosis of COVID-19 or current symptoms suggestive of COVID-19

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation
        in this study:

          1. Current abuse of alcohol or other drugs that, in the judgement of the Principal
             Investigator (PI) could interfere with patient compliance.

          2. Inability to travel to the NIH Clinical Center for study visits

          3. Any medical or mental health condition that, in the judgement of the PI, would make
             the volunteer unable to participate in the study.

          4. Positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR at screening visit.

          5. History of any of the following in the past 14 days: fever &gt; 38.2 degrees Celsius; new
             or worsening respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, dyspnea).

          6. Pregnancy

        INCLUSION OF VULNERABLE PARTICIPANTS:

        Pregnant Women will not be enrolled in the protocol. If a woman is pregnant at the time of
        screening she will not be enrolled until the end of her pregnancy because important
        baseline research assessments (e.g. leukapheresis, chest x-ray, pulmonary function testing)
        should not be done during pregnancy.

        Children will not be included in this study. Due to the rarity of COVID-19 in children (as
        of 4/11/2020 in Maryland, &lt;2% of cases occurred in children), it would not be possible to
        recruit enough children to address the protocol research objectives. In addition, pediatric
        restrictions for the volume of blood permitted to be drawn for research purposes and the
        more than minimal risk of apheresis in children would severely limit the ability to conduct
        the immunologic studies described in this protocol.

        Participation of Employees

        NIH employees may be enrolled in this study as this population meets the study entry
        criteria.

        Neither participation nor refusal to participate as a participant in the research will have
        an effect, either beneficial or adverse, on the participant s employment or position at
        NIH.
