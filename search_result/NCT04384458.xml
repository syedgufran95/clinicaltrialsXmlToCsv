  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We have to be aware of the challenge and concerns brought by 2019-nCoV to our healthcare
      workers. Front-line healthcare workers can become infected in the management of patients with
      COVID-19; the high viral load in the atmosphere, and infected medical equipment are sources
      for the spread of SARS-CoV-2. If prevention and control measures are not in place, these
      healthcare workers are at great risk of infection and become the inadvertent carriers to
      patients who are in hospital for other diseases. Nowadays a question that has not yet been
      clarified by science has been arises: is hydroxychloroquine associated with zinc compared to
      ivermectin associated with zinc effective as a prophylaxis for asymptomatic professionals
      involved in the treatment of suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19?

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a open-blind, randomised trial that will be conducted in asymptomatic
      professionals working in areas of high exposure and high risk of transmission of SARS-COV-2.

      After obtaining fully informed consent, the investigator will recruit workers in areas of
      high exposure and high risk of transmission of SARS-COV-2.

      Participants will be divided into 2 groups:

        -  Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) = 400mg twice on day 1, 400mg/day on day 2, 3, 4, and 5
           followed by 400mg once every 05 days, for the next 7 weeks associated with 20 milligrams
           twice on day of active zinc for 45 consecutive days;

        -  Ivermectin (IVM) = Dosage guidelines based on participant body weight, once on day for 2
           consecutive days, This dose schedule should be repeated every 14 days for 45 days
           associated with 20 milligrams twice on day of active zinc.
