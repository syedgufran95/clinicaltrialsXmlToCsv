  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal seeks to enhance acceptability and uptake of COVID-19 testing and vaccination
      to engage African American and Latinx public housing residents in South Los Angeles. Given
      the multiple disparities experienced by public housing residents, the investigators will
      utilize a theoretically-based, multidisciplinary and culturally tailored intervention to
      reduce barriers and implement innovate strategies to engage this population in the uptake of
      COVID-19 testing and vaccination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Through the engagement and empowerment of 15 trained COVID-19 health ambassadors, the
      investigators will jointly implement and evaluate a theoretically based and
      culturally-sensitive socio-behavioral intervention that will: a) reduce mistrust, fatalistic
      beliefs, and related psychosocial barriers that hinder COVID-19 testing and vaccination; b)
      increase receptivity and willingness for uptake of COVID-19 testing and vaccination; and c)
      assess perceived impact of psychosocial and health outcomes related to COVID-19 testing and
      vaccination for 310 African American and Latinx public housing residents.

    <description>This is a pre-experimental &quot;one group pretest-posttest&quot; design to improve COVID-19 associated health outcomes and willingness and uptake toward testing and vaccination among 310 Hispanic and African American public housing residents in South Los Angeles. The proposed intervention will employ (1) culturally sensitive, (2) theoretically based intervention that will be jointly delivered by our COVID-19 health ambassadors and our researchers. We will use the Information, Motivation, and Behavioral Skills (IMB) model and the Transtheoretical Model to implement the intervention.</description>
