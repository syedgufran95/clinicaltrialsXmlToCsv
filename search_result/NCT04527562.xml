    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, double blind, randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial. The
      participants will be randomized into two groups (group A and group B). Patients of group-A
      are the treatment group. They will be treated with optimal treatment based on the algorithm
      proposed in National Guidelines on Clinical Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19)
      Version 7.0, 28 May 2020, along with Colchicine for 14 days. The patients in group-B will be
      controlled group. They will be treated with optimal treatment based on the algorithm proposed
      in National Guideline along with a placebo.
