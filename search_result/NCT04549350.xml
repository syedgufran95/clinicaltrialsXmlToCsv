  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The novel coronavirus has brought the world into uncharted waters. Whole countries are on
      lockdown, the economy has ground to a halt, and many people are afraid for themselves and
      their loved ones. With such unprecedented changes coming on so quickly, it's understandable
      that the importance of sleep is flying under the radar. But as we adjust to stay-at-home
      orders and try to remain healthy in a time of COVID-19, focusing on sleeping well offers
      tremendous benefits.

      Millions of people suffered from insomnia before the coronavirus, and unfortunately, the
      pandemic creates a host of new challenges even for people who previously had no sleeping
      problems. The coronavirus pandemic doesn't affect everyone in the same way. Of course,
      patients with the virus and front-line medical workers face the brunt of the direct impacts
      of the disease. Social distancing, school closures, quarantines, working-from-home: all bring
      profound changes to normal routines for people of all ages and walks of life.

      The aim of the current work is to assess the sleep quality among health care workers in the
      front-line management of COVID-19 in Kuwaiti Ministry of Health hospitals and its relation on
      medical errors.
