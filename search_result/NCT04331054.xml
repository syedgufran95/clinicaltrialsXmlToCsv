  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that inhaled steroid therapy and long acting beta 2 adrenergic agonist, widely
      prescribed in asthma patients, may also have a local protective effect against coronavirus
      infection, even in patients without asthma.

      The primary purpose is To compare time to clinical improvement in patients receiving standard
      of care associated to the combination budesonide/formoterol or standard of care only.

      Time (in days) to clinical improvement is defined as the time from randomization to an
      improvement of two points (from the status at randomization) on a seven-category ordinal
      scale or live discharge from the hospital, whichever came first within 30 days.

      D1 inclusion / randomization visit:

      Patients who meet the eligibility criteria and whose infection with Covid-19 has been
      confirmed within 48 hours will be included in the respiratory diseases department by the
      pneumologist investigator.

      Patients will be randomized either to the control group or to the intervention group. For
      interventional patients, trial treatment (SYMBICORT RAPIHALER 200/6 µ) will begin within 12
      hours.

      Follow-up period (D2 to D29) and end of study visit (D30):

      Throughout their hospital stay, patients will be followed in accordance with the practice of
      the service.

      During hospitalization, investigators are free to decide for antibiotics, steroids, anti
      viral drugs, hydroxychloroquine and oxygen support management in accordance with local
      practice. None of the laboratory tests are made for the study. They are usually performed in
      patients hospitalized for acute respiratory infection.

      Interventional patient will also be treated with SYMBICORT RAPIHALER 200/6 µg (2 puffs 2
      times a day).

      In the event that the patient is discharged from hospital before the end of his
      participation, he will be contacted by phone on D30 in order to obtain information concerning
      the period outside hospitalization

    <description>Time (in days) to clinical improvement is defined as the time from randomization to an improvement of two points (from the status at randomization) on a seven-category ordinal scale or live discharge from the hospital, whichever came first within 30 days.
The seven-category ordinal scale consisted of the following categories:
Not hospitalized with resumption of normal activities
Not hospitalized, but unable to resume normal activities
Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen
Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen
Hospitalized, requiring nasal high-flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, or both;
Hospitalized, requiring ECMO, invasive mechanical ventilation, or both
Death.
These parameters will be evaluated daily during hospitalization.</description>
