  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale In a very short time corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic
      with high morbidity and mortality. The main cause of death is respiratory failure including
      acute respiratory distress syndrome, however the exact mechanisms and other underlying
      pathology is currently not yet known. In the current setting of the COVID-19 pandemic
      complete autopsies seem too risky due to the risk of SARS CoV-2 transmission. Yet, as so
      little is known, additional histopathological, microbiological and virologic study of tissue
      of deceased COVID-19 patients will provide important clinical and pathophysiological
      information. Minimal invasive autopsy combined with postmortem imaging seems therefore an
      optimal method combining safety on the one hand yet proving significant information on the
      other.

      This study aims to determine the cause of death and attributable conditions in deceased
      COVID-19 patients. This will be performed using post-mortem CT-scanning plus CT-guided MIA to
      obtain tissue for further histological, microbiological and pathological diagnostics. In
      addition, the pathophysiology of COVID-19 will be examined by further tissue analysis.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Determination of cause of death and contributing factors based on clinical, radiological, microbiological and histopathological data of the deceased patient</measure>
    <time_frame>up to one month</time_frame>
    <description>For each individual patient the cause of death and contributing factors will be assessed. For each individual these diagnoses will be made during a meeting of a multidisciplinary team consisting of at least an infectious diseases physician, a radiologist and a pathologist. On a case to case basis, additional medical specialists can be asked to attend, including an intensive care specialist, a geriatrician and/or a microbiologist.
During the meetings, the clinical, radiological, microbiological and histopathological data will be presented to all attending specialists. The final diagnoses will be based on consensus.
Outcomes will be reported as proportions with a 95% confidence interval.</description>

    <description>On the basis of clinical observations at this moment in time correlations will be done between the renal histology findings of the patients with and without renal failure at death as well as between the cardiac histology findings of the patients with and without clinical signs of myocarditis. However, in the light of continuous clinical observations and new insights, this may be expanded in the future. Outcomes will be reported as proportions with a 95% confidence interval.</description>

    <intervention_name>CT-scan with minimal invasive autopsy</intervention_name>
    <description>CT-guided biopsies will be performed directly following the diagnostic CT-scan. Biopsies will be taken from heart, liver, lungs, spleen, kidneys and abdominal fat according to a standard operation procedure. Biopsies will be taken for further histological examination and storage in the biobank. Of the lung, additional samples will be taken for microbiological examination. Additional samples will be taken in case of (focal) abnormalities on CT-imaging. In case of pleural, cardiac or abdominal fluid, this will be aspirated for further cytological, biochemical and microbiological examination. Finally, 15 cc blood will be drawn from the heart.</description>
