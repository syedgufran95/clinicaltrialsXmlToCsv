  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this phase 2, multicentric, placebo-controlled double-blind,
      randomized study is to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and
      azithromycine on the viral load drop at day 5 among patients with COVID-19 and hematological
      malignancies.

    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the effect of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycine
      versus placebo among 114 patients with COVID-19 and hematologic malignancy.

      After randomization in 1:1 ratio, patients will receive either the study treatment or placebo
      :

        -  Patients enrolled in the experimental arm will receive hydroxychloroquine (200mgx3
           tablets per day during 10 days) and azithromycine (500 mg at day 1 then 250mg per day
           during 4 days)

        -  Patients enrolled in the control arm will receive a placebo of hydroxychloroquine (3
           tablets per day during 10 days) and a placebo of azithromycine (2 capsules at day 1,
           then 1 capsule per day during 4 days)
