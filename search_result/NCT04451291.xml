  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to see how safe and effective decidual stromal cells are in treating
      patients with respiratory failure (breathing problem where not enough oxygen is passed from
      the lungs into the blood) caused by COVID-19.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 viral infectious disease that has lead to high numbers of critically ill patients or
      death due to respiratory failure.

      Decidual Stromal Cells (DSC) may be useful in the treatment of acute respiratory distress
      syndrome (ARDS) by reducing lung inflammation and then time that patients require help with
      breathing (mechanical ventilation).
