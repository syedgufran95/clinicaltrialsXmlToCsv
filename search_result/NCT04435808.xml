      The HCW Prophylaxis (HCWP) Study, single, open and off label intervention study. Up to 350
      participants will be assigned to group that takes HCQ or group that opts to not take study
      medication. Participants will be UNM HEALTH SYSTEM HCW at high risk for occupational exposure
      to SARSCoV- 2. Study timepoints will include Day 1 screening/enrollment, 30 day, 60 day, and
      90 day assessments. Questionnaires will be collected in all timepoints.

      This is an open and off label use, interventional, single site study. The HCWP Study
      eligibility are HCWs at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 exposure (eg MD/DO, NP, RN, and respiratory
      therapists in ED, Pediatric ED, Urgent Care, Pediatric Urgent Care and on Covid-19 units) at
      UNM HEALTH SYSTEM meeting all inclusion criteria. Total number of participants: 350 (Group A
      and B) Group A: up to 275 (HCW who choose to be provided HCQ) Group B: up to 75 (HCW who
      choose not to be provided HCQ)
