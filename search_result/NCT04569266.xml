  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dyspnea is defined by a subjective sensation of respiratory discomfort, the intensity of
      which varies according to the terrain, the anamnesis and the cause. Resuscitation is
      associated with many causes of dyspnea, including initial distress, mechanical ventilation,
      or after-effects following the pathology and its management.

      Respiratory distress is the most severe form of impaired lung function. It is the first cause
      of hospitalization in intensive care. This distress, indicative of the failure of the
      respiratory system, is always severe and potentially fatal. It therefore constitutes an
      absolute therapeutic emergency. Dyspnea is often the revealing symptom of the condition and
      the urgency surrounding its management is an additional factor of concern for the patient. As
      a result, dyspnea is a pejorative element associated with severity or even death.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During these episodes of respiratory insufficiency, the management is based on ventilatory
      replacement by generally invasive mechanical ventilation. This allows correction of hematosis
      disorders but can lead to complications either directly (respiratory infections) or
      indirectly (neuromuscular complications and/or complications related to prolonged bed rest
      requiring prolonged re-education). Although mechanical ventilation makes it possible to
      improve the objective parameters and contributes considerably to improving the prognosis of
      these patients, it is nevertheless, despite the progress made, often associated with patient
      breathlessness due to respiratory pathology and difficulties in optimizing the interaction
      between the individual and the machine.

      Resuscitation will also be associated with amyotrophy due to bed rest, inflammation, reduced
      metabolic possibilities, especially anabolic ones, and the use of certain treatments
      (corticosteroids, curares). This muscle loss rapidly affects the diaphragm, then secondarily
      the peripheral muscles in the context of resuscitation neuromyopathy. On the other hand,
      complications affecting the entire musculoskeletal system will quickly cause the
      resuscitation patient to suffer from cardiorespiratory desadaptation, reducing the capacity
      for exertion on discharge and ultimately resulting in dyspnea on exertion.

      In patients surviving the initial condition, dyspnea persists and may be reoccurring months
      or even years later, despite initial rehabilitation. It is strongly associated with anxiety
      and even fear of death and contributes to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder.
      This persistent feeling of respiratory discomfort, which limits the patient's autonomy in his
      or her daily activities, seems to be able to reduce quality of life. Moreover, the
      perpetuation of this dyspnea could promote a spiral of deconditioning leading to a
      progressive deterioration of the cardio-respiratory system, justifying new hospitalizations.

      In patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency, exercise rehabilitation supervised by
      physiotherapists allows, in addition to improving autonomy, a significant reduction in
      dyspnea, thus increasing the quality of life of these patients.

      Our objective is to evaluate the effect of post-resuscitation respiratory rehabilitation for
      SARS-Cov-2 in improving dyspnea. Secondly, we will seek to evaluate the correlation between
      quality of life and post-resuscitation dyspnea.

    <description>Patients will not benefit from any specific exercise rehabilitation treatment until 6 months post-ICU. They will then be proposed to follow the &quot;treatment&quot; protocol if efficacy is demonstrated, once their follow-up in the study is completed.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive a prescription for exercise rehabilitation, at the rate of 2 sessions of approximately 1 hour each per week for 10 weeks.
Continuous endurance training will start at 60-70% of the patient's maximum power. For patients who are unable to maintain continuous re-training, &quot;interval training&quot; sequences (30 seconds of effort followed by 30 seconds of rest) may be offered.
Initially, the effort will be 15 minutes, then gradually increase to reach an exercise duration of 40 minutes or 45-60 minutes for endurance or interval training respectively.
The power can be adjusted as the patient progresses to reach the target heart rate and dyspnea at 4-6 on the BORG scale.
All patients will be offered lower limb and upper limb strengthening exercises. Each exercise will consist of 3-4 sets of 6-12 repetitions.</description>

    <description>Patients meeting the eligibility criteria will be selected consecutively. They will be contacted by telephone after at least 3 months post-resuscitation. The mMRC score is then evaluated. In case of mMRC&gt;1, the study will then be proposed by the physiotherapist or the referring investigating physician of each participating center during this call. The patient is then offered an appointment on the reference rehabilitation platform of each center. The CDM measurement as well as the quality of life by the SF-12 scale are also carried out. Patients are then randomized in one of the two groups (&quot;control&quot; or &quot;treatment&quot;).</description>
