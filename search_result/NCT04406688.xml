      The two biomarkers determined in urine, &quot;Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP-2)&quot;
      and &quot;Insulin-like Growth Factor-Binding Protein 7 (IGFBP7)&quot;, can indicate the occurrence of
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) in cardiac surgery and critically ill patients at an early stage.
      However, no data are available whether these parameters can also predict the occurrence of
      AKI in the context of COVID-19 infection. An early prediction of AKI can be helpful for the
      optimisation of therapeutic management to improve patient outcome and for the triage of
      patients.

      The aim of this observational study is to evaluate whether the biomarker [TIMP- 2]*[IGFBP7]
      can predict the occurrence of AKI in critically ill patients suffering from SARS-CoV2
      associated acute respiratory distress syndrome.

      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is rapidly spreading around the
      world. The current outbreak of infections with SARS-CoV-2 is termed Coronavirus Disease 2019
      (COVID-19). Two other coronavirus infections, SARS in 2002-2003 and Middle East Respiratory
      Syndrome (MERS) in 2012, both caused severe respiratory syndrome in humans. All 3 of these
      emerging infectious diseases are caused by β-coronaviruses.

      Although COVID-19 primarily affects the lungs and may cause severe hypoxemia, other organs
      including the GI tract, heart and kidney are affected. Acute kidney injury secondary to
      COVID-19 (COV-AKI) is reported to occur in about 15-25% of patients hospitalized with
      COVID-19 infection. The majority of AKI cases are mild to moderate with renal replacement
      requirement in about 25%. However, AKI was much more common in non-survivors (&gt;50%). Although
      kidney failure appears to occur late in the course, patients may begin to develop AKI within
      the first 3 days of hospitalization. Similar to AKI in other settings,3 COV-AKI is likely to
      be of variable etiology. Thus, there may be a long window for treatment.

      The two cell-cycle arrest markers, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2) and
      insulin-like growth-factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7), have been shown to early predict the
      occurrence of AKI in cardiac surgical and critically ill patients. However, there is no data
      available whether (TIMP-2)*(IGFBP7) can predict the occurrence of AKI in the COVID19 setting.
      Early prediction of AKI may be valuable to optimize therapeutic management in order to
      improve patient's outcome and might be helpful to triage patients.

      The goal of this observational trial is to evaluate whether (TIMP-2)*(IGFBP7) early predicts
      the occurrence of AKI in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV2 associated ARDS.
