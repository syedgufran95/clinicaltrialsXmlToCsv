  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Lung failure is the main cause of death
      related to COVID-19 infection. The main objective of this study is to evaluate if Ibrutinib
      is safe and can reduce respiratory failure in participants with COVID-19 infection.

      Ibrutinib is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of COVID-19.
      Participants are assigned 1 of 2 groups, called treatment arms. Each group receives a
      different treatment. There is a 1 in 2 chance that participants will be assigned to placebo.
      Around 46 adult participants with a diagnosis of COVID-19 will be enrolled at multiple sites
      in Unites States.

      Participants will receive oral doses of Ibrutinib or placebo capsules once daily for 4 weeks
      along with standard care.

      There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their
      standard of care. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood
      tests, checking for side effects.
