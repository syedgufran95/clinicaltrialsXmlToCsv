  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this investigation is to understand the patient response to a
      robotic platform used to facilitate telehealth triage in the emergency department during the
      COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the manner in which emergency department
      triage is completed. Attempts at cohorting individuals with potential COVID-19 disease in
      order to prevent disease transmission to healthcare workers and minimize the use of personal
      protective equipment (PPE) have renewed interest in telemedical solutions as a method to
      triage and manage individuals with COVID-19. This investigation deploys a legged robotic
      platform to facilitate agile, highly mobile telemedicine to manage COVID-19 patients in the
      emergency department. The primary objective is to measure the patient response to interacting
      with these systems.
