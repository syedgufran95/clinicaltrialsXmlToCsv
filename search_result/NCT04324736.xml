  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019) is a life-threatening infectious disease caused by the
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that appeared in December 2019
      in the Wuhan district. COVID-19 has since affected more than 150 countries across the world
      and especially France. The first epidemiological data, mostly from Chinese studies, indicate
      that diabetes is one of the most common comorbidities, with high blood pressure, in patients
      with COVID-19. Moreover, the presence of diabetes at admission would be a risk factor for
      both ICU hospitalization and death.

      Nevertheless, specific data on people with diabetes and COVID-19 are fragmentary, justifying
      the achievement of a dedicated prospective observational study.

      The French nationwide CORONADO study aims to specifically describe the phenotypic
      characteristics of patients with diabetes admitted to hospital with COVID-19 infection.
      Particular attention will be devoted to glycemic control at admission (i.e. the level of
      HbA1c), the diabetic complications, as well as anti-diabetic and antihypertensive therapies.

      This study will provide answers to caregivers and patients with diabetes regarding the risk
      factors related to diabetes for COVID-19 prognosis. This pilot study will be used for the
      development of new studies and for the establishment of recommendations for the cost of care
      in patients with diabetes and COVID-19.
