  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective clinical cohort study of consecutive patients hospitalized at all
      hospitals of greater Copenhagen with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The
      investigators aim to examine if echocardiography - both conventional and advanced - can be
      used to predict which patients will develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or
      other short-term acute complications, especially focusing on cardiovascular outcomes. In
      addition, using a novel technique of lung ultrasound (LUS), The investigators aim to analyze
      specific LUS-findings, and associate them with short-term prognosis and development of ARDS
      and long-term cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In all patients included, The
      investigators aim to examine long-term complications at timepoints: 2, 5 and 10 years of
      follow-up and examine if echocardiography - alone and in combination with biomarkers - can be
      used to detect early signs of cardiac complications and predict long-term risk of
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality following COVID-19 infection
