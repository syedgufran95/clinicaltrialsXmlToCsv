    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the clinical characteristics, the incidence of myocardial
      injury, and the influence of myocardial injury on the prognosis in COVID-19 patients. There
      is no additional examination and treatment for this project.

    <textblock>
      The epidemic of the COVID-19 has expanded from Wuhan through out China, and is being exported
      to a growing number of countries. Recently, investigators have revealed that acute myocardial
      injury is existed in 7.2% patients with COVID-19, and this proportion in patients admitted to
      the ICU (22.2%) is higher than patients not treated in the ICU (2.0%). Thus, cardiac troponin
      I (cTNI), the biomarker of cardiac injury, might be a clinical predictor of COVID-19 patient
      outcomes. This study aims to investigate the clinical characteristics, the incidence of
      myocardial injury, and the influence of myocardial injury on the prognosis in COVID-19
      patients.
