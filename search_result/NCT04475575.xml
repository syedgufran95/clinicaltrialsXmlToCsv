  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19), spread worldwide and has become an emergency of major
      international concern. In March 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global
      pandemic. Accurate and fast diagnosis is crucial in managing the pandemic. Current diagnostic
      approaches raise several difficulties: they are time-consuming, expensive, invasive, and most
      important lacking high sensitivity. The gold standard diagnostic test for COVID-19, reverse
      transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is highly dependent on adequate deep
      sampling of the swab in the naso- and oropharynx. A new diagnostic test that can correctly
      and rapidly identify infected patients and asymptomatic carriers is urgently required to
      prevent further virus transmission and thus reduce mortality rates.

      Aim: This proof-of-principle study aims to investigate if an electronic nose (Aeonose) can
      distinguish individuals with antibodies from individuals without antibodies against COVID-19
      based on analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

      Methods: between April and July 2020, persons undergoing RT-PCR and a serology test for
      COVID-19 were recruited at Maastricht UMC+ for breath analysis. All participants had to
      breathe through the Aeonose for five consecutive minutes. The VOC pattern in their exhaled
      breath was then linked to the matching RT-PCR and serological test results.

    <description>All participants breathed through the Aeonose for five minutes. This device contains metal-oxide sensors that change in conductivity upon reaction with VOCs in exhaled breath. These conductivity changes are input data for machine-learning and used for pattern recognition. A nose clip was placed on the nose of each participant to avoid entry of non-filtered air in the device. Before measuring, the Aeonose was flushed with room air, guided through a carbon filter as well. During each measurement, a video was displayed to distract the participant and to reduce the chance of hyperventilation. Failed breath tests were excluded from analysis; the reason for failure was documented. Four similar Aeonose devices were used for breath analysis. A full-measurement procedure required sixteen minutes.</description>
