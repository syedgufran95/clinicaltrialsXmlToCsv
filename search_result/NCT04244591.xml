  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this multi-center, randomized, control study, the investigators will evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of glucocorticoid in combination with standard care for COVID-19 patents with
      Severe acute respiratory failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that was initially outbreak in Wuhan, China. Severe acute
      respiratory infection with COVID-19 causes severe acute respiratory failure with substantial
      mortality. Currently, the standard care is supportive care, and no treatment is proven to be
      effective for this condition.

      Glucocorticoid therapy is widely used among critically ill patients with other coronavirus
      infection such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory
      syndrome). However, whether glucocorticoid improved the outcome of COVID-19 remains unknown.
      We hypothesized that glucocorticoid would improve the prognosis of patietns with COVID-19.

      In this study, critically ill patients with COVID-19 were enrolled and randomized to receive
      ether standard care or standard care in combination with methylprednisolone therapy. The
      primary outcome is the difference of Murray lung injury score between two groups.
