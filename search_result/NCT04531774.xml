  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The healthcare industry is inherently demanding, stressful, and, at times, emotionally
      draining. On a typical day, many workers must make rapid and critical decisions, manage
      numerous demands, team conflicts, and challenging situations with patients and their
      families. For some health care workers (HCW), the current pandemic - COVID-19 - has also
      exacerbated these challenges. Providing psychological support is key in alleviating stress
      among HCWs, yet the situation does not require therapy because HCWs do not principally suffer
      from a mental disorder. RECHARGE was specifically developed for HCWs and is an abbreviated
      online version of Problem Management Plus, an evidence-based intervention that helps to cope
      with stress in times of crisis. As a brief psychological intervention for adults affected by
      adversity emerging from stress exposure, RECHARGE teaches people three well-documented
      strategies to manage acute stress (a: managing stress, b: managing worry, c: meaningful
      activity). It includes psychoeducation, arousal reduction techniques, managing worries and
      problem-solving skills, behavioral activation, and enhancement of meaningful activities,
      which are all based on the principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy. The aim of this study
      is to evaluate the efficacy of RECHARGE to reduce stress in HCWs and enhance their work
      performance. Participants in this randomized controlled trial (RCT) study are randomly
      assigned to either RECHARGE or the active control group. To this end, stress including
      symptoms of burnout, worries, anxiety, depression, PTSD, and work performance will be
      measured at baseline, post-intervention, and at a 2 and 6 month follow up.
