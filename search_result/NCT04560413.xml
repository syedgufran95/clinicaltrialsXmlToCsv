  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has begun, first in
      Wuhan, China, and then became a pandemic. The first SARS-CoV-2 case in Turkey was reported on
      March 11, 2020. People older than 65 years old became subject to lock down measures beginning
      on March 21, while people younger than 20 years old became subject to lock down measures
      beginning on April 03. A total lock down has been implemented a few times lasting between 3
      to 4 days, especially at weekends. Several studies show that mental health problems could
      occur in public during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

      Depression and anxiety are a commonly known mental health issue in post-stroke patients. This
      patient population, who usually have to spend most of their time at home, remained completely
      at home and socially isolated due to the precautions required by the pandemic. Based on the
      above research evidence; depression, anxiety and phobia of SARS-CoV-2 may increase in the
      post stroke patients due to being in risk group and effects of measures taken against
      SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Therefore, we aimed to assess the depression, anxiety and SARS-CoV-2
      phobia in post stroke patients during SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, and to explore the potential
      influence factors.

      90 post-stroke patients who meet the working criteria were called by phone. All of them were
      followed up in the stroke outpatient clinic of the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation
      Clinic. Only 77 patients were reached. Permission was asked for questioning from the patients
      reached. The health and social status of the patients who agreed to participate in the study
      during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic period was questioned with the form we prepared. Form template
      included socio-demographic features, physical, and detailed medical histories. In addition,
      the fear based on the SARS-CoV-2 virus was examined with the Covid-19 phobia scale (CP19-S),
      while anxiety and depression were evaluated with the hospital anxiety and depression scale
      (HADS). Furthermore, Brunnstrom stages, Barthel index and functional ambulation
      classification (FAC), which was evaluated in the last 6 months, was recorded from the files
      to explore mobilization of the patients.

      The C19P-S is a self-report instrument with a five-point Likert-type scale to assess the
      levels of SARS-CoV-2 phobia. All items are rated on a 5-point scale from &quot;strongly disagree
      (1)&quot; to &quot;strongly agree (5).&quot; The scores on the scale can range between 20 and 100 and a
      higher score indicates a greater phobia in the respected subscales and total scale. In the
      present study, total scale scores ranged from 20 to 100. The scale examines four main
      factors: psychological, psycho-somatic, economic and social HADS that includes anxiety and
      depression subscales. HADS is a self-report scale. It consists of 14 items, 7 of which are
      depression and 7 of which are symptoms of anxiety. Answers are evaluated in four Likert
      formats. The cutoff scores of the Turkish form of the HAD scale were determined as 10 for the
      anxiety subscale and 7 for the depression subscale. The purpose of the scale is not to make a
      diagnosis, but to determine the risk group by screening anxiety and depression in a short
      time in those with physical illness.

    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale evaluation includes a total of 14 questions (score range 0-3), which are scored to separately estimate anxiety and depressive status (7 questions each). The individual score for the anxiety and depression subscales may vary from 0 to 21. The aim of this scoring system is not to make an objective diagnosis, but to determine the current presence and tendency to anxiety or depression at the time of diagnosis. A HADS score of 8 to 10 is broadly accepted as indicating mild symptoms, a score between 11-16 suggests moderate anxiety or depression, and a score of 16 or more indicates severe anxiety or depressive symptoms</description>
