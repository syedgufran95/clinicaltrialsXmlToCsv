    <textblock>
      Patients with documented moderate COVID-19 infection will be randomized 1:1 to receive
      piclidenoson 2 mg Q12H orally with standard supportive care (SSC - intervention arm) or
      placebo orally with SSC (control arm) for up to 28 days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot trial of piclidenoson 2 mg Q12H
      added to SSC, compared to placebo plus SSC, in a population of hospitalized subjects with
      &quot;Moderate&quot; COVID-19 per U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) Coronavirus Disease 2019
      (COVID-19) Treatment Guidelines (2020). Subjects will be randomized according to a 1:1 ratio
      to one of the trial arms, and treated for up to 28 days, at the discretion of the
      Investigator. Piclidenoson 2 mg and placebo are supplied as matching tablets for oral
      administration.

      Following initial diagnosis of COVID-19, and after having provided informed consent, subjects
      will be randomized according to 1:1 ratio to one of the trial arms on Day 0. SSC will be
      implemented and documented for all subjects, and maintained throughout the treatment period.

      Vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate per minute, respiratory rate per minute,
      oxygen saturation (SpO2), and PaO2/FiO2) of subjects will be monitored twice daily according
      to SSC. Parameters of clinical, respiratory, and vital status will be collected daily. Viral
      shedding will be assessed on a regular basis. Samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis will
      be collected on Day 4.

      Efficacy of piclidenoson will be assessed by clinical, respiratory, and virologic parameters.
      Safety and tolerability of piclidenoson will be assessed by adverse event (AE) monitoring,
      vital signs assessment, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and clinical laboratory tests (complete
      blood count (CBC) and extended chemistry panel). Adverse events will be graded by the Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0).
