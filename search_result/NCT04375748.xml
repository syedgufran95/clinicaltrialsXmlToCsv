    <textblock>
      To date, the effects of SARS-Cov-2 (Covid-19) on the myocardium and the role it plays in the
      evolution towards an acute myocarditis are badly understood. The current pandemic of this
      emerging virus is an opportunity to assess the proportion of acute myocarditis attributable
      to SARS-Cov-2(Covid-19) and to assess the clinical, biological and imaging presentations, by
      means of a national prospective multicentre hospital registry of cases of acute myocarditis.

      Although research on the subject has only recently started developing, the links have already
      been described between SARS-Cov-2 infection, the severity of the clinical status, and the
      presence of risk factors or a history of cardiovascular disease (hypertension, diabetes,
      stroke, etc.). Additionally, depending on the series and definition used for cardiac injury
      (troponin elevation and/or natriuretic peptides), this concerns 7-29% of patients with a
      clear predominance in severe patients. The mechanisms behind these troponin elevations and
      cardiac injury are likely to be multiple and variable depending on clinical
      presentation,severity and patient history. A significant association was found between
      troponin elevation, and that of CRP and NtproBNP, suggesting an inflammatory part to this
      cardiac damage. As with other coronaviruses, SARS-Cov-2 infection can cause massive release
      of proinflammatory cytokines which can lead to inflammation of the vascular wall. This can be
      the cause of true instability or even rupture of plaque(type1 infarction) but can also be
      responsible for tissue hypoxia without rupture of plaque causing myocardial pain (infarction
      type 2). In addition, there may be areal myocardial inflammation causing acute myocarditis,
      secondary to the cytokine storm or direct damage to the myocardium by the virus itself. In
      case of acute coronary syndrome presentation, a coronary exploration should be realized to
      highlight or eliminate a type 1 infarction, but it is clearly difficult to distinguish
      between a type 2 suffering (no viral attack direct but suffering from hypotension or hypoxia
      for example) and inflammatory myocardial damage with or without direct viral myocardial
      damage (myocarditis). In the context of the viral pandemic at Covid19, although few data
      exist,it is legitimate to consider the possibility of true arrays of acute inflammatory
      myocarditis or by direct viral attack which could thus modify the natural history and the
      prognosis of patients, thus justifying a dedicated diagnosis and treatment. The primary
      objective was to assess the proportion of positive SARS-Cov-2 cases among the patients
      included (hospitalized for acute myocarditis). During the study period, this proportion will
      be assessed at regular intervals, for example every month, or more frequently if the number
      of patients included varies substantially from one week to another. This will make it
      possible to trace a development curve for the entire period of the pandemic.

      The secondary objectives were (1) to describe the clinical, biological and imaging
      characteristics of the acute myocarditis among the positive and negative SARS-Cov-2 patients
      of the myocarditis cohort; (2) to assess the short-term (30 days) and long-term (1 year)
      prognosis of the acute myocarditis among the positive and negative SARS-Cov-2 patients of the
      myocarditis cohort and (3) to identify the factors associated with a 30-day and 1-year
      prognosis of cases of acute myocarditis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients treated in ICCU or ICU (polyvalent, surgical or medical), in one of the
             participating hospitals, for symptoms of acute myocarditis confirmed by a myocardial
             MRI and/or a CT scan and/or a myocardial biopsy. It seems important to include elderly
             patients who may be under guardianship or curatorship since these patients seem to
             present the most severe forms. Additionally, the populations most affected by viral
             myocarditis are generally adolescents and young adults,which justifies including them
             in the study too. Pregnant women are a population at potentially greater risk,
             particularly during the third trimester because of the neuro-hormonal changes inherent
             in pregnancy. This justifies trying to implement the investigator's knowledge through
             this observational study.
