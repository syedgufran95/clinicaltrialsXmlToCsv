  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, first-in-human (FIH) study to assess
      safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of SCB-2019 at multiple dose levels, administered
      as 2 injections IM in healthy subjects. Each study vaccine dose level will be evaluated with
      and without adjuvant.

                  corticosteroids is allowed.Note: Systemic (oral or parenteral) corticosteroids
                  are also prohibited for 3 weeks after the second dose of the study
                  vaccine/placebo.
