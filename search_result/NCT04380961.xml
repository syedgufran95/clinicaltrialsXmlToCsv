    <measure>Time to Improvement of at Least 2 Categories Relative to Baseline on the 6-Point Ordinal Clinical Recovery Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Time to improvement is defined as an improvement of at least 2 categories relative to baseline on the 6-point ordinal clinical recovery scale. The 6-point ordinal clinical recovery scale provides 6 mutually exclusive conditions ordered from best to worst, and the score reflects the participant's worst situation on the day assessed. The ordinal clinical recovery scale categories are : not hospitalized (category 1); Hospitalization; not requiring supplemental oxygen (category 2); hospitalized, requiring low flow supplemental oxygen (category 3); hospitalized, on non-invasive pressure ventilation or high flow oxygen devices (category 4); hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO (category 5); death (category 6).</description>
