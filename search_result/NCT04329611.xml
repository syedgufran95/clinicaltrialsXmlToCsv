  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Albertans with COVID-19 are at risk of deteriorating and developing severe illness. Those
      over age 40 or with co-morbid illness, and likely those who are immune suppressed, are at
      highest risk. This study will include a focus on people with immune-suppressed states.
      Individuals confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection will be identified using administrative
      data (positive lab result, age 18 or over, not hospitalized, and not living in SL4 level of
      care). They will then be contacted by AHS staff, independent of the researchers, to obtain
      their consent for the researchers to contact them about this trial. The AHS staff member who
      contacts the individual will enroll consenting individuals into a study database. If they
      provided an email address an email will automatically be sent to the individual with study
      information. Those who decline to be contacted will also be informed of the study website so
      they can choose to review the study information and self-enrol, although they will need to do
      so quickly to meet study timelines. Enrolled participants will be contacted by a study
      coordinator. Those without access to the internet will be informed about the study details
      when they are contacted by a study coordinator. When the study coordinator contacts potential
      participants the study will be reviewed, and the potential participant will have an
      opportunity to ask questions. Consent for participation will be obtained by telephone.
      Telephone consent will be recorded. Participants will then be screened for inclusion and
      exclusion criteria by telephone interview and review of Alberta Netcare. Alberta Netcare is
      the province of Alberta's public Electronic Health Record used to store patient information
      so that it is easily accessible to healthcare professionals for the purpose of care.
      Information like immunizations, ECG results, diagnostic images and reports, written medical
      reports (e.g. surgery reports, consultations, hospital admissions), diagnostic lab testing
      results (e.g. blood tests, urine tests, blood bank info), allergies and intolerances (drug
      and food allergies, food intolerances), prescription history, and general patient information
      (e.g. name, birthdate, personal health number, address, phone number). Those who are not
      eligible for the study will be informed of the reason(s) for ineligibility (generally it will
      be a safety exclusion and they should be aware of this). Those who are eligible will be
      randomized to receive HCQ or placebo for a total duration of 5 days. Study drug will be
      delivered to their residence by courier. Telephone follow-up will occur at day 7 (range 7-10
      days) and at day 30 (range 25-35 days).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This double-blind placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial will determine if
      hydroxychloroquine for 5 days, initiated within 96 hours of confirmation of a positive
      COVID-19 result, and within 12 days of symptom onset, reduces the occurrence of severe
      COVID-19 disease. Severe disease is defined as the composite of hospitalization, invasive
      mechanical ventilation and 30-day mortality. This trial will enrol consenting adults who are
      not hospitalized, are age 18 or over, have a risk factor for severe disease, have no
      contraindication to treatment with hydroxychloroquine, can swallow pills, and who do not have
      a severe underlying comorbidity where treatment is not likely to be beneficial to the
      patient.

      Secondary outcomes will be the proportion of participants requiring hospitalization, invasive
      mechanical ventilation, 30-day mortality, and disposition at 30 days, defined as recovered,
      ongoing symptoms but not hospitalized, hospitalized, or deceased.

      Randomization will be stratified by age, risk of severe disease, and Alberta Health zone of
      primary residence. A pre-specified risk classification that includes immunosuppressed status
      will define those at high risk of severe disease. Health care delivery across Alberta Health
      zones will likely differ, in part due to the remote location of most patients in some zones.

      Alberta has a single publicly funded health care system with processes and administrative
      data that will allow complete capture of health system encounters and resource utilization.
      The population is ethnically diverse. In 2016, 23.5% of Albertans belonged to a visible
      minority group compared with 22.3% for Canada overall (1). Also, in 2018, 94.1% of Albertans
      age 15 and older used the internet for personal use compared with 91.3% for Canada overall;
      this excluded full-time residents of institutions (2). This will support a high degree of
      electronic recruitment and data capture.

      The current COVID-19 epidemic has also paused most ongoing research, thus providing access to
      many experienced researchers and highly trained research staff.

      Lack of any proven treatments for this severe condition makes it imperative that we use the
      resources we have to try to improve the lives of Albertans and determine if there is evidence
      for the use of hydroxychloroquine for confirmed COVID-19 disease, overall, and in high risk
      participants.

    <intervention_model_description>Randomization will be conducted using an online tool. The use of an online tool will allow for dynamic randomization which ensures concealment of allocation. We will use a minimal sufficient balance randomization tool to ensure balance on age, sex, risk status (binary variable based on immune competence and other identified risks), days from symptom onset to randomization and provincial health zone (5 categories). These variables will be identified at telephone screening by a study coordinator, clarified with a physician when necessary, and entered into the online randomization tool. It is predicted that many patients will want treatment. Further, immunosuppressed patients may be at the highest risk of fatal outcomes. Therefore, we will use 2:1 randomization (HCQ: placebo).</intervention_model_description>
