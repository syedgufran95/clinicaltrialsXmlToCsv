      The objectives of PROVIDE are to:

        1. Determine if prophylactic once weekly hydroxychloroquine reduces the incidence of
           conversion from SARS-2-CoVnasopharyngeal swab negative to positive

        2. To determine if weekly prophylactic hydroxychloroquine reduced the severity of COVID-19
           symptoms

        3. To determine the safety of taking weekly prophylactic hydroxychloroquine
