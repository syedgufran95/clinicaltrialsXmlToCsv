  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of treating COVID-19 infection by using Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir and Nitazoxanide
      will be examined. Included patients will be into 3 groups. The 1st group will receive
      Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir plus the standard care treatment (SCT). The 2nd group will take
      Nitazoxanide and SCT, while the 3rd group will receive only SCT. Then the clinical
      improvement and the rate of PCR change from positive to negative will be evaluated in each
      group.

      This study is an open-label, randomized, controlled trial. A total of 240 patients who are
      recruited in 2 quarantine hospitals (15th of May hospital, Cairo, and Al Rajhi hospital,
      Assiut), will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio (80 patient in each treatment arm), to
      receive either the fixed combination of Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir (400 mg and 90 mg, orally) once
      daily for 14 days, plus the standard care treatment regimen (SCT) for COVID-19 patients
      according to the Egyptian Ministry of Health (MOH) protocol (Group 1), or nitazoxanide (500
      mg, orally) four times per day for 14 days, plus STC (Group 2), or SCT alone (Group 3). All
      treatment groups will be followed up by laboratory investigations and PCR for SARS-CoV-2
      virus at the time of enrollment, days 5, 8, 11, and 14. Supportive care comprised, as
      necessary, supplemental oxygen, noninvasive and invasive ventilation, antibiotic agents,
      vasopressor support, renal-replacement therapy, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
      (ECMO). To ensure a balanced distribution of case severities in all study groups,
      randomization will be stratified based on the case severity index issued by WHO
      (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/clinical-management-of-novel-cov.pdf).

      Written informed consent will be obtained from all patients or the patient's legal
      representative if the patient is too unwell to provide consent. The trial will be conducted
      in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical
      Practice guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonisation. The authors are
      responsible for designing the trial and for compiling and analyzing the data. The authors
      vouch for data completeness and accuracy and adherence to the trial protocol.

        .

        Written informed consent will be obtained from all patients or the patient's legal
        representative if the patient is too unwell to provide consent. The trial will be conducted
        in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  This study will include patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection and admitted to
             COVID-19 quarantine hospitals. Included patients should be &gt; 12 years old, with
             creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/ml, and without any malignancy. Patients with COVID-19
             infection are classified clinically into mild, moderate, severe, and critical cases
             according to the management guide for COVID-19 published by the Egyptian Ministry of
             Health and Population. Mild cases are defined as patients in whom clinical symptoms
             are mild, and no pneumonia manifestations can be found in imaging. Moderate cases are
             defined as patients having symptoms such as fever and respiratory tract symptoms, etc.
             and pneumonia manifestations can be seen in imaging. Severe cases are patients who
             meet any of the following criteria; (a) respiratory rate &gt; 30 breaths/min, (b) oxygen
             saturations&lt; 93% at a rest state, (c) arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/
             Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)&lt;300 mm Hg, or (d) patients with more than 50%
             lesions progression within 24 to 48 hours in lung imaging should be treated as severe
             cases. Finally, critical patients are those who are meeting any of the following
             criteria; (a) occurrence of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, or
             (b) the presence of shock; other organ failures that require monitoring and treatment
             in the ICU. All patients with an established diagnosis of COVID-19 in Egyptian
             quarantine hospitals at any clinical stage will be included in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients &lt; 12 years old.

          -  Pregnant females.

          -  Patients with renal impairment with creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min.

          -  Patients with malignancies particularly Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC).

          -  Patients using Favipiravir or Lopinavir-Ritonavir, as the co-administration of these
             drugs with Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir has not been studied.

          -  Patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh score B and C).
