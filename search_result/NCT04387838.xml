  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emerging in China in December 2019, Covid-19, whose pathogen is SARS-Cov-2, was declared a
      global pandemic in March 2020. The clinical presentation is highly variable, ranging from
      asymptomatic forms to acute respiratory distress and even death. Transmission occurs through
      droplets, with a R0 of approximately 3.

      Rapidly, population protection measures were put in place by governments, including the
      confinement of all persons whose functions were not considered essential and the closure of
      educational institutions.

      Health care institutions are places at risk of Covid-19 transmission and hospital staff are
      particularly exposed, either through direct contact with patients, contact with exposed
      persons or through the environment. In order to protect personnel, hygiene measures were
      immediately recalled and reinforced.

      This study is aimed at evaluating the incidence rate of anti-SARS-Cov2 seroconversion over 2
      months among hospital staff, without any supposed anti-Covid treatment 19.

    <description>At Day 0, a blood sample is collected by venipuncture and a questionnaire is being filled. The anti-SARS-CoV2 serological status is measured by automated microplate ELISA technique on the EVOLIS analyzer (Biorad®), using reagent kits from EUROIMMUN France.
For individuals who are anti-SARS-CoV2 seronegative, the same intervention is made at Day 30 and D60.
For the individuals who are anti-SARS-CoV2 seropositive, the study follow-up is stopped.</description>
