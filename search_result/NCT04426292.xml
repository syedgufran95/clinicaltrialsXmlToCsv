  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel zoonotic coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan (Hubei Province, China) mid-December
      2019 and was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus
      rapidly spread to the rest of the world, including Europe and explicitly affects the
      respiratory system, generating Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

      This study is a monocentric interventional prospective cohort study. After signing a written
      informed consent, participants will be recruited for questionnaire completion and blood
      sampling. Sample storage and analysis will be performed at the laboratory of microbiology of
      the UZ Brussel.

        -  To document SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among employees of the UZ Brussel at day 0 (i.e.
           at beginning of the study, planned early May 2020), month 2 and month 5.

        -  To document number of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversions among employees of the UZ Brussel over
           a period of 5 months.
