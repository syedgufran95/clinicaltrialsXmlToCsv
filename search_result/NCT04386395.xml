  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV-2 outbreak causes a spectrum of clinical patterns that varies from asymptomatic
      infection to mildly symptomatic manifestations and more-severe forms that need intensive
      care. Until now, the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection has been poorly reported
      to help decision for immune modulation therapies. As a consequence, trials have been designed
      to test both anti-inflammatory molecules as steroids or anti-bodies against IL-6, and others
      proposing to &quot;boost&quot; immunity with interferon beta based on similar inclusion criteria.

      The immune response to infective agents including viruses may have a complex time evolution
      with early and late phases corresponding to different patterns, oscillating between
      pro-inflammation and immune-depression. The potential window to improve outcome in COVID-19
      by therapeutic intervention aimed at a fine tuning between immune toxicity and
      immunodepression requires a longitudinal assessment during the course of illness, especially
      for the patients who develop acute respiratory failure. Immune monitoring of both innate and
      adaptive immunity would then be essential to appropriately design clinical trials.

      The whole blood cells evaluation was recorded according to the time intervals between the
      onset of symptoms and the sampling after ICU admission. Patients' care was standardized,
      especially with regard to ventilation, sedation, and antimicrobial treatment.

      In this study the investigators prospectively perform a longitudinal study of both innate and
      adaptive immunity on patients admitted to ICU for an COVID-19 related acute respiratory
      failure. The data will be analyzed in reference to the onset of initial symptoms and also to
      the admission in ICU.

      The primary end point is the evolution of the characterization of monocytes and their subsets
      in term of number and expression of HLA-DR. A similar approach is used for lymphocytes and
      their subtypes with in addition, an ex vivo testing of their capabilities to be stimulated by
      SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins in term of TNFalpha, INFgamma, and IL1beta production.

      The secondary end-point was to test the association with outcomes and other non-specific
      markers of inflammation as CRP (C reactive protein), PCT (procalcitonin), DDimers and
      ferritin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most severe form of COVID-19 treated in intensive care for acute respiratory failure may
      have a poor prognosis. Both the level of IL-6 and the severity of the lymphopenia have been
      associated to the poor prognosis. Better knowledge of the time evolution of the circulating
      immune cells subpopulations and functions will help to best tailor the treatment:
      anti-inflammatory strategy at the initial phase might be rapidly shifted to immune
      stimulation when immunodepression is diagnosed.

      It is then essential to assess the patients' immune status using flowcytometry methods to
      characterize both innate and adaptive immunity of the whole blood circulating immune
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). After cell staining with the adequate cell
      markers, the flowcytometry (NAVIOS® Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter) allowed to analyze the
      number and the function of the cells with an adequate gating strategy and the Kaluza®
      software v2.1 (Beckman Coulter). The data were then grouped by time intervals referring to
      the onset of symptoms and also to the ICU admission. The trend for innate immunity (monocytes
      number and subpopulations, HLA-DR expression) and for adaptive immunity (lymphocytes and
      subpopulations) will be analyzed. Since it is unknown if whole blood CD3/CD4 and CD3/CD8
      lymphocytes elicit an &quot;exhaustion&quot; pattern and/or an abnormal response, an ex vivo testing of
      their reactivity for SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins will be performed. This test of
      polyfunctionality will characterize the intracellular cytokine expression (IL-1 beta,
      TNFalpha, and INFgamma) both for CD4 and CD8 T cells.
