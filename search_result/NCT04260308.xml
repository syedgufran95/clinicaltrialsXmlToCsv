      administrative regions in China; 23 foreign countries reported new coronavirus pneumonia
      cases, 147 confirmed cases. In the face of the rapid spread of the epidemic, people's panic
      and anxiety have seriously affected the prevention and control of the epidemic. In the face

      of the epidemic. In order to help the epidemic prevention and control, the investigator plan
