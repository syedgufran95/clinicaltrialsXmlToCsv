      To assess the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) pandemic on the attitude,
      behaviour and mental health of rheumatic patients and to compare them with healthy
      individual. This is cross-sectional survey, 360 participants were included and divided into
      cases group composed of 180 patients with rheumatic diseases and control group composed of
      180 healthy people. Data were collected via a self-administered structured questionnaire
      (Google form) which was sent to participants via social networks and emails to different
      rheumatic patients and healthy individuals. Mental health was measured by the five-item Brief
      Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5).

      Conclusion: Mental health should be addressed in the same manner we deal with the infectious
      disease itself, being of no less importance. It is essential for mental health professionals
      provide psychological support to vulnerable populations, including the infected and
      chronically ill patients and their families, individuals, communities and health care
      workers.
