        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Over 19 years of age

          2. COVID-19 confirmed by a real-time RT-PCR tests 4 days prior to clinical trial
             enrollment

          3. Patients with peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SPO2) greater than 94% at the
             time of screening

          4. Patients whose body temperature is measured according to the measured area without
             taking a fever reducer during screening:

             [armpit of greater than 37.0 째C or an oral of greater than 37.2 째C; Patients with
             rectum greater than 37.6 째C or eardrum greater than 37.5 째C] (Notes: Although you take
             a fever reducer, you can still be enrolled in after investigator's judgement whether
             there is fever or not.)

          5. Patients with evidence of lung invasions as a result of radiation tests

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who need breathing device (for example, Invasive ventilation, Invasive
             mechanical ventilation, Extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation).

          2. Patients who participated in other clinical trials related to COVID-19.

          3. Patients who were administered drugs directly to COVID-19 24 hours prior to the start
             of the study.

          4. Patients whose AST or ALT has increased by more than 5 times the normal lab value.
