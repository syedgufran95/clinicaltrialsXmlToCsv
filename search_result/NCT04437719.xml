    <textblock>
      This registry will allow to evaluate the correlation of the incidence and evolution of
      associated symptoms of infection of COVID-19 with the biological and clinical parameters in
      patients followed in Oncology during the COVID-19 pandemic.

      Prior to conducting any of the screening tests, the Investigator or his designee will explain
      the trial fully to the prospective patient and provide him with a copy of the Patient
      Information Leaflet/Informed Consent Form.

      If the patient is willing to participate to the trial, his given oral, free, informed and
      express consent will be collected and traced in his medical file.

      The screening questionnaire will be completed. The patient's suitability for the trial will
      be confirmed by the inclusion/exclusion criteria .

      Following completion of the Baseline Questionnaire, patients will receive the Daily
      Questionnaire. This is designed to assess if they have developed symptoms associated with
      COVID-19 infection.

      If a participant responds that they are not feeling well, a series of follow-up questions
      will be asked regarding what symptoms they are currently experiencing.

      The Daily Questionnaire will be asked of patients every day throughout the Observation Period
      of 6 months.

      At the end of the Observation Period, all patients will complete a series of questionnaires
      relating to the conduct of the study and tools employed.

    <description>If the patient is willing to participate to the trial, his given oral, free, informed and express consent will be collected and traced in his medical file. After enrollment, patients will be sent an invitation via email to download the Obvio-19 mobile app. After downloading the Obvio-19 app, patients will receive instructions as to how they may communicate with the study investigator. Communication may occur through the chat function of the app or live telephone conversations.
Patients must log into the Obvio-19 app daily to complete the questionnaires. The Obvio-19 system is designed to identify responses that indicate the participant is at an increased risk for serious illness or exhibiting serious symptoms, such as coughing up blood. Such patients will be notified by the app of this status and prompted to seek medical attention.</description>
