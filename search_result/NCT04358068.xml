      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and
      azithromycin (Azithro) to prevent hospitalization or death in symptomatic adult outpatients
      with COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase IIB study will evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin
      (Azithro) to prevent hospitalization or death in symptomatic adult outpatients with COVID-19
      caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive active/placebo study treatment as follows:
      HCQ/Placebo 400 mg orally twice a day on Day 0 followed by 200 mg orally twice a day for 6
      days, and Azithro/Placebo 500 mg once on Day 0, followed by 250 mg daily for 4 days.

      Stratification will be by &quot;high&quot; versus &quot;low&quot; risk of progression to severe COVID-19, where
      &quot;high risk&quot; is defined as a person age ≥60 years or having at least one of several specified
      comorbidities.

      Participants will receive study treatment for 7 days and will be followed for an additional
      13 days. Assessments on a subset of participants will include blood collection,
      self-collected nasal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs.
