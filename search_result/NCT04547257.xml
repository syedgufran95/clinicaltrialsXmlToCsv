      Safety and Performance Evaluation of Seraph 100 Microbind Affinity Blood Filter (Seraph 100)
      in the treatment of patients with COVID-19

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, randomized, controlled clinical investigation designed to
      evaluate the safety and performance of Exthera Medical Seraph 100 Microbind Affinity Blood
      Filter in the reduction of pathogen load from the blood in septic patients with suspected,
      life-threatening bloodstream infection (BSI).

      Subjects from treatment and control group will follow standard of care treatment. Control
      group will not be treated with Exthera Medical Seraph 100 Affinity Blood Filter (Seraph 100).

      The clinical investigation will be conducted at approximately 3 centers in Germany. Subjects
      will be randomized to the treatment group (Seraph 100 + standard of care) versus control
      group (standard of care only).

      Subjects will be followed until the last subject completes their 28-day follow-up phone call.
      Clinical Investigation follow-up will occur at Baseline (confirmation of eligibility), Day 0
      or Treatment, Follow-up visits after 12 hours, at Day 1, after 36 hours, at Day 2, Day 3, Day
      7 and Follow-up phone call at 28 days
