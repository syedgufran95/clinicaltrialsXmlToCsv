      A questionnaire containing some critical questions about practice inside GI endoscopy units
      in different countries will be distributed via emails. Responses will be collected in an
      online platform and data will be analyzed to reveal the effect of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on
      different aspects of GI endoscopy practice in the studied countries.
