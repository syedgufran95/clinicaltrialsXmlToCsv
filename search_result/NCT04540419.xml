  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase III clinical trial to evaluate efficacy, reactogenicity and safety of
      the vaccine Ad5-nCoV compared with placebo in volunteers at the age from 18 to 85 years，with
      the randomized, double-blind design
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 500 healthy adult volunteers at the age from 18 to 85 years will be randomized
      into two treatment (vaccination) groups in ratio 3:1 by double-blind design.

      Volunteers in group 1 (n=375) will be administered a single dose of the vaccine Ad5-nCoV
      (5E10vp).

      Volunteers in group 2 (n=125): will be administered a single dose of placebo. Vaccine
      Ad5-nCoV or placebo will be administered intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle of the arm
      at a single dose of 0.5 mL (1 prefilled syringe).
