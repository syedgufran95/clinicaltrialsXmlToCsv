  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, due to the effects of COVID-19 pandemic, there is an imperative need to change the
      healthcare model. In this regard, telemedicine has proved very useful in health crises, in
      which there is a possibility of infection between people, offering remote access to medical
      care. Telemedicine has been used in many chronic diseases such as asthma and chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, and appears to be well accepted by
      patients. However, few studies have been conducted in surgical services and in other
      diseases. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the level of acceptance of the
      patients, in this pandemic situation, to a telemedicine follow-up in different departments.

      This is an observational, cross-sectional, multicenter and international study with
      prospective and retrospective data collection. To evaluate patients' acceptance, we used the
      validated questionnaire Telehealth usability questionnaire (TUQ). In addition, all patients
      will provide an overall satisfaction score for telemedicine on a scale from 1 to 5 (1=lowest;
      5=highest satisfaction).
