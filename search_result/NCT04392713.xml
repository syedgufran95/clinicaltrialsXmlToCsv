      INTERVENTION It will be a randomized controlled trial which will be done on COVID-19 patients
      proven by PCR fulfilling the criteria (asymptomatic/mild to moderate severity). They will be
      divided into two groups after randomization. Group A will be administered Ivermectin single
      dose of 12grams along with Chloroquine as per existing hospital guidelines and group B will
      be given Chloroquine alone. Dose of Ivermectin to be repeated at 1 week if PCR stays
      negative. PCR will be done on alternate days (48, 96 and 144hours) and the duration at which
      the PCR becomes negative will be compared. Dose of drug subject to change in accordance with
      patient response or possible side effect.
