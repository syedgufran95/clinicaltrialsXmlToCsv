  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying lockdown measures have made mental health a
      pressing public health concern. Acts that focus on benefiting others-known as prosocial
      behaviors-offer one promising intervention that is both flexible and low cost. However,
      neither the range of emotional states prosocial acts impact nor the size of those effects is
      currently clear, both of which directly influence its attractiveness as a treatment option.
      Using a large online sample from Canada and the United States, the investigators will examine
      the effect of a three-week prosocial intervention on two indicators of emotional well-being
      (happiness and the belief that one's life is valuable) and mental health (anxiety and
      depression). Respondents will be randomly assigned to perform prosocial, self-focused, or
      neutral behaviors each week. Two weeks after the intervention, a final survey will assess
      whether the intervention has a lasting effect on mental health and emotional well-being. The
      results will illuminate whether prosocial interventions are a viable approach to addressing
      mental health needs during the current COVID-19 pandemic, as well for those who face
      emotional challenges during normal times.

      This study is intended to be published as a registered report. The details of the study
      design are likely to change somewhat during the review process. However, below is the current
      plan:

      The investigators will examine the effects of prosocial behavior using a 3-week experimental
      intervention, followed by a follow-up assessment at 5 weeks. At baseline the research team
      will measure participants' emotional well-being and mental health. Emotional well-being will
      be assessed using happiness and feeling that one's life is valuable, which is a facet of
      sense of meaning in life. Mental health will be measured as depression and anxiety. At the
      end of the baseline survey the researchers will randomly assign participants to one of three
      experimental conditions (between-subjects design). In each condition, respondents will be
      asked to perform certain types of behaviors for the first three days of each week, as
      detailed later in this protocol.

      Respondents will be contacted for the first three days each week and asked to report what
      they did. At the end of weeks 1, 2, and 3 they will complete a longer survey that repeats the
      same measures of emotional well-being and mental health used at baseline. At this point the
      intervention will be complete. The investigators will recontact respondent two weeks later
      (at the end of week 5) to assess whether the intervention has a lasting effect on mental
      health and emotional well-being. This final survey will also include a measure of whether or
      not respondents continued their assigned behaviors following the end of the intervention.
      This measure might be useful for explaining any lasting effects in exploratory analyses.

      The expected effect size is d = 0.19. The research team will assess experimental effects
      using multiple linear regression. The models will include indicator variables for
      experimental conditions as well as controls for baseline levels of happiness, valued life,
      depression, and anxiety. These baseline measures should be unrelated to experimental
      conditions (which will be randomly assigned) so including them will increase the efficiency
      of estimates. Under the assumption that these variables will account for at least 50% of the
      variance in the outcomes, the sample size needed to detect an effect of size d = 0.19 with
      95% power is N = 357 or approximately 360 per condition. The expected attrition rate is 30%
      after baseline which means that the investigators will sample 360/0.7 = 514 per condition.

      The research team will post the baseline survey in two batches. The first batch will contain
      half the sample (N = 771), and will be used to gauge the attrition rate (see data exclusion
      criteria). The sample size of the second batch will be adjusted as needed to try and capture
      the desired number of respondents per experimental condition. This will lower the size of the
      second batch if attrition rates are lower than expected or increase the size of the second
      batch if attrition rates are higher than expected. If a sufficient sample size has not been
      obtained at this point, the investigators will repeat the process until at least 350
      respondents in each experimental condition are recruited. To be clear, the stopping rule for
      recruiting sample participants does not require estimating any of the effects of interest in
      the study (i.e., it does not depend on the anticipated effect size). The only factor is
      whether a sufficient number of respondents have been recruited for each experimental
      condition.

      Obtaining a sufficient per-condition sample size might take several days. The researchers
      plan to begin sampling on a Sunday and continue sampling (if needed) on Monday. This means
      respondents will finish their first three days of the study on either Wednesday or Thursday.
      In either case, the investigators will distribute the end of week 1 survey the following
      Sunday, which will then put both groups of respondents on the same schedule for the remainder
      of the study. The researchers will try to recruit the full sample during this initial
      recruitment phase, as this will simplify administering the study. However, if initial
      sampling does not yield a sufficient sample size, the researchers will repeat the sampling
      procedure each week until a sufficient number of respondents is obtained. In this case, the
      study will be administered to different &quot;cohorts&quot; of respondents spaced a week apart.

    <time_frame>baseline, end of weeks 1, 2, 3, and 5</time_frame>
    <description>The Subjective Happiness Scale consists of four items: (1) &quot;In general, I consider myself _______.&quot; Responses options run from 1 = &quot;not a very happy person&quot; to 7= &quot;a very happy person.&quot; (2) &quot;Compared to most of my peers, I consider myself ________&quot; with response options from 1 = &quot;less happy&quot; to 7 = &quot;more happy.&quot; (3) &quot;Some people are generally very happy. They enjoy life regardless of what is going on, getting the most out of everything. To what extent does this characterization describe you?&quot; (1 = &quot;not at all&quot; to 7 = &quot;a great deal&quot;). (4) &quot;Some people are generally not very happy. Although they are not depressed, they never seem as happy as they might be. To what extent does this characterization describe you?&quot; (1= &quot;not at all&quot; to 7= &quot;a great deal&quot;; reverse coded) These four items will be averaged into a scale ranging from 1-7, where higher scores indicate greater subjective happiness.</description>

    <description>Respondents' individual perceptions of whether their life has value will be measured using the valued life subscale developed by Morgan and Farsides. This measure will consist of the average of the following four items: (1) &quot;My life is worthwhile,&quot; (2) &quot;My life is significant,&quot; (3) I really value my life,&quot; and (4) I hold my own life in high regard.&quot; In each instance, response options will run from -3 = &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to 3 = &quot;strongly agree&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Change in depression from baseline using the CESD (8-item)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, end of weeks 1, 2, 3, and 5</time_frame>
    <description>Depression will be measured using the well-established 8-item short-form of the Centre for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D). Respondents will report how often in the past week they (1) felt depressed, (2) felt that everything was an effort, (3) felt that sleep was restless, (4) felt happy (reverse coded), (5) enjoyed life (reverse coded), (6) felt lonely, (7) felt sad, and (8) could not get going. Responses will be scored where 0 = &quot;rarely or none of the time,&quot; 1 = &quot;some of the time,&quot; 2 = &quot;a moderate amount of time,&quot; and 3 = &quot;most or all of the time.&quot;</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in anxiety from baseline using the HADS-A</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, end of weeks 1, 2, 3, and 5</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety will be measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety (HADS-A), which is both commonly used and well-validated. This is a 7-item scales that asks respondents how often in the past week they: (1) felt tense or wound up, (2) got a frightened feeling as if something awful was about to happen, (3) had worrying thoughts go through their mind, (4) got a frightened feeling like butterflies in the stomach, (5) felt restless as if they had to be on the move, (6) had a sudden feeling of panic, and (7) could sit at ease and feel relaxed. To ensure consistency with our measure of depression, responses will be coded where 0 = &quot;rarely or none of the time,&quot; 1 = &quot;some of the time,&quot; 2 = &quot;a moderate amount of time,&quot; and 3 = &quot;most or all of the time.&quot;</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Canadian and American respondents from the Amazon Mechanical Turk

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Respondents will be excluded from the study if any of the following apply:

          1. A respondent completes the baseline study unrealistically quickly. Response speed will
             be measured using the average number seconds spent on each survey item (seconds per
             item, or SPI). Following Wood et al., a response will be viewed as unrealistically
             fast if its SPI value is less than 1. SPI calculations will exclude optional items.

          2. A respondent does not complete at least half of the items in the baseline survey.

          3. A respondent provides off-topic, non-sensical, or non-English responses to an
             open-ended question in the baseline survey. A comment must be judged as meeting these
             criteria by two raters to be excluded.

          4. A respondent does not agree to continue with the study after completing the baseline
             study.

          5. A respondent completes the baseline study using a suspicious IP address. These include
             IP addresses that are outside Canada or the United States, or that appear to originate
             from a VPS according to IP Hub.

          6. Technical difficulties prevent a respondent from completing the baseline study.

        Because obtain sufficient power to detect effects is a central aim of this study, the
        investigators will replace respondents who are removed for reasons 1-5 in a rolling
        fashion. In the case of technical failure (#6), the first approach will be to resolve the
        issue and administer the baseline survey to the same participant. If this is not possible,
        a replacement will be recruited.
