    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the virus RNA, and miRNA levels related to viral
      infection, and inflammatory response in tears of hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of
      COVID-19 with and without conjunctivitis and to correlate them with clinical condition.

      Tears will be collected by using Schirmer Test I, a non invasive painless test which can be
      performed at the patient's bed. Tears will be collected on the graduated paper strips pulling
      the lower lid gently downward for 5 minutes. Following, the strip will be placed in a 2.0 mL
      Eppendorf tube and stored at -80◦C (or - 20°C)

    <textblock>
      The SARS-CoV-2 is a virus highly infectious whose main target of infection is the respiratory
      tract. Virus has been reported to target other mucus tissues, such as the conjunctiva of the
      eye and causes conjunctivitis. A recent study has detected the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the
      tears of patients affected by COVID-19 with conjunctivitis, using real-time reverse
      transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This suggests that droplets and body fluids
      of infected people can contaminate the human conjunctival mucosa and it can be a view of
      transmission that it must not be ignored.

      A role of miRNAs has been found in ocular infections such as fungal, bacterial, viral
      infections. It would be interesting to correlate tear fluid miRNA levels to patients clinical
      findings
