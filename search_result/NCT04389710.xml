    <textblock>
      This protocol provides access to investigational convalescent plasma for patients in acute
      care facilities infected with SARS-CoV-2 who have severe or life-threatening COVID-19, or who
      are judged by a healthcare provider to be at high risk of progression to severe or
      life-threatening disease. Following provision of informed consent, patients will be
      transfused with 1-2 units of ABO compatible convalescent plasma obtained from an individual
      who has recovered from documented infection with SARS-CoV-2 (as detailed in separate
      protocol). Safety information collected will include serious adverse events judged to be
      related to administration of convalescent plasma. Other information to be collected will
      include patient demographics, acute care facility resource utilization (total length of stay,
      days in ICU, days intubated), and survival to discharge from acute care facility.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label expanded access program to make appropriately matched convalescent
      plasma available for the treatment of patients in acute care facilities infected with
      SARS-CoV-2 who have severe or life-threatening COVID-19, or who are judged by a healthcare
      provider to be at high risk of progression to severe or life-threatening disease. COVID-19
      convalescent plasma will be obtained from the Jefferson Blood Bank and will meet all
      regulatory requirements for conventional plasma and FDA's additional considerations for
      COVID-19 convalescent plasma
