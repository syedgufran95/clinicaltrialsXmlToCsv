  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 epidemic (Coronavirus Disease 2019) currently raging in France is an emerging
      infectious disease linked to a virus of the genus coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
      Epidemiologically, acute myeloblastic leukemias (AML) are the most common of acute leukemias.
      The incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is 900 new cases in France in 2018, of
      which 57% in humans. The treatments administered to AML and ALL patients induce variable
      immunosuppression: neutropenia, neuropathy, deficits in humoral or cellular immunity or
      combinations of these deficits. Patients with AML or ALL therefore represent a population at
      high risk of developing a serious form in the event of infection with SARS-CoV-2. To date, no
      data is available in the literature to assess the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic in the
      population of patients with acute leukemia.

      The main objective of the study is to determine the clinical and biological prognostic
      factors during SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with acute leukemia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of acute leukemia according to WHO criteria 2016 â‰¤ 5 years

          -  Diagnosis of a proven or probable SARS-CoV-2 infection according to the following
             criteria:

               1. Proven infection: positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) regardless of the
                  radio-clinical picture (other tests made available later and having good
                  diagnostic performance will be accepted)

               2. Probable infection: negative PCR but association of

                    1. Evocative clinical signs, of recent installation: fever, respiratory signs
                       (cough, dyspnea, chest pain), body aches, sore throat, rhinorrhea, headache,
                       diarrhea / abdominal pain, frank asthenia, loss of taste / smell,
                       conjunctivitis, type of frostbite AND

                    2. evocative radiological signs, on CT: diffuse or diffuse aspect of frosted
                       glass, condensations including pseudo-nodular condensations, association of
                       frosted glass and condensation within the same lesion, nodules and
                       micronodules, thickening of the interlobular septa) or on chest radiography:
                       interstitial, alveolo-interstitial or alveolar syndrome, single or bilateral
                       AND

                    3. absence of differential diagnosis
