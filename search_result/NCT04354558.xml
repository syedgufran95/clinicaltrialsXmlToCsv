  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the outbreak of a syndrome of acute respiratory distress associated to a novel
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2) that began in China, Europe and France have to face a sanitary
      emergency with critically care support when the patient evolves to an acute respiratory
      distress (ARDS). In the context of supply shortages (ventilators, bed capacities) that
      countries have to deal with, data were lacking of characteristics and outcomes of patients
      admitted to intensive care unit (ICU). the purpose of this project is to report the
      epidemiology and the outcomes of a French cohort of critically ill patients with SARS-Cov2
