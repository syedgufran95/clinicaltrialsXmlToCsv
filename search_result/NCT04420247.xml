      Facing the challenge of finding an efficient treatment for COVID-19, the viral pneumonia
      caused by the Coronavirus SARS-Cov-2, this study intended to test if Chloroquine or
      Hydroxychloroquine, two drugs with strong in-vitro antiviral role proven by numerous studies
      and with a well defined safety profile established, for efficacy in treating COVID-19 and
      improving an ordinal primary outcome composed by a 9-levels scale, which was recomended by
      the World Health Organization.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, Adaptive, Multicentric Randomized Controled Trial of efficacy to test the
      effect of either Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine for 5 days in the recomended dose
      standardized by brazilian Ministry of Health.

      Patients were randomized using stratified randomization by hospital and severity at the
      moment of randomization (stipulated by use of mechanical ventilation or not) into two arms:
      Intervention and Control. Intervention group recieved a loading dose of 900mg of Chloroquine
      or 800mg of Hydroxycloroquine in the first day, followed by 450mg of chloroquine of 400mg of
      hydroxychloroquine. Primary and secondary outcomes were evaluated on the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 10th,
      14th, 28th day after randomization.
