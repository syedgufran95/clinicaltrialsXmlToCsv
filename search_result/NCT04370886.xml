  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The fight against the spread of the 2019-nCoV epidemic has achieved some success in China,
      but the epidemic is far from over. A key factor making the epidemic under control in China is
      the government's call for social distance, which has led to few people going out for
      donation. As a result, the number of blood donors on the streets has been continuing to
      decline. Urgent recruitment of blood donors is therefore planned during the period from 30
      April to 10 May via emergency recruitment SMS . This study has been designed to compare which
      information extraction frameworks would be more sensitive to blood donors in emergency
      situations.

      Researches has showed that that the information extraction and processing in emergency was
      different from the normal situation. To understand what information the blood donors are more
      sensitive to in an environment that may pose a potential threat to themselves, this
      interventional study has been designed. Eligible blood donors in Guangzhou Blood Center has
      been randomly divided into four groups according to their sociological variables, their
      interval since last blood donation , their history donation times and the location of their
      last blood donation. Three groups of donors has been randomly selected as interventional
      groups, and will receive three kindly of emergency blood donor recruitment SMS respectively.
      The placebo group donors will only receive a May Day greeting SMS.

      One blood donor recruitment SMS will emphasize what blood services will do to ensure the
      safety of blood donors during their donation in 2019-nCoV epidemic, one will shows
      information about a loss-based framework, while the third one will show information about a
      benefit-based framework .

    <description>The literature shows that the information extraction and processing in emergency is different from the normal situation. To find the most effective emergency recruitment method during an outbreak, we intervened with a well-balanced group of donors by presenting different emergency recruitment text messages.</description>
