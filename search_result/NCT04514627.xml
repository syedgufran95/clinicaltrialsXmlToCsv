  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is a disease caused by the virus, SARS-CoV-2. Patients with this viral infection are
      at risk for developing pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
      Approximately 20% to 30% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia require
      intensive care for respiratory support. Clinically, ARDS presents with severe hypoxemia
      evolving over several days to a week in combination with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on
      chest X-ray. Widespread alveolar epithelial cell and pulmonary capillary endothelial injury
      can lead to severe impairment in gas exchange. In one report of 1,099 patients hospitalized
      with COVID-19, ARDS occurred in 15.6% of patients with severe pneumonia. In a smaller case
      series of 138 hospitalized patients, ARDS occurred in 19.6% of patients and in 61.1% of
      patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU).

      To date, no effective treatment has been established to treat COVID-19 or to prevent
      progression of ARDS. It is thought that a heightened immune response with an unbalanced
      release of inflammatory mediators in the airway is a major cause of morbidity and mortality
      associated with the disease. It is therefore reasonable to postulate that improved outcomes
      may be obtained in patients with a balanced immune response with adequate viral control and
      appropriate counter-regulatory immune responses whereas a poor outcome may be expected in
      patients with inadequate viral control or a heightened immune response or what is referred to
      as a &quot;cytokine storm&quot;. Thus, modulating the pulmonary immune response without suppressing the
      immune system would be a viable strategy for patients with COVID-19. The current literature
      supports the role of neuromodulation, particularly vagal nerve stimulation (VNS), in
      modulating the immune response. Modulating the pro-inflammatory pathway through VNS has been
      demonstrated to decrease inflammatory mediators and improve outcomes in several animal models
      and in humans.

      Percutaneous electrical nerve field stimulation (PENFS) provides a novel, non-invasive method
      of VNS through a non-implantable device applied to the external ear. Already, the FDA has
      cleared this technology for reducing symptoms of opioid withdrawal in patients with opioid
      use disorder. Symptoms of opioid withdrawal can be decreased by approximately 90% after 1
      hour of stimulation. Similarly, the IB-Stim device has been shown to improve symptom in
      children with abdominal-pain-related functional GI disorders and recently received market
      approval by the FDA for that indication. Unpublished studies have demonstrated marked
      decrease in inflammation with PENFS compared to sham stimulation in a model of TNBS colitis.
      While the efficacy of PENFS in modulating the progression of pulmonary disease in patients
      with COVID-19 is unknown, several proposed mechanisms for regulation of the immune response
      through VNS have already been demonstrated. We propose to perform an open label, randomized
      study to evaluate the efficacy of PENFS for the treatment of respiratory symptoms in patients
      with COVID-19.

    <description>The BRIDGE/PENFS device manufactured by Key Electronics, consists of a battery activated generator and wire harness that connects to the generator. Four leads are also attached to the generator, each with a sterile 2 mm, titanium needle. The BRIDGE device settings are standardized and deliver 3.2 volts with alternating frequencies (1 ms pulses of 1 Hz and 10 Hz) every 2 s. This stimulation targets central pain pathways through branches of cranial nerves V, VII, IX, and X, which innervate the external ear. The PENFS device generator has a battery life of 5 days and delivers almost continuous stimulations throughout the 120 hours.</description>
