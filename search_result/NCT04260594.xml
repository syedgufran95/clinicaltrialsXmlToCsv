    <textblock>
      In the absence of 2019-ncov specific therapeutic drugs, arbidol is effective against a
      variety of coronaviruses in vitro pharmacodynamics. In order to observe the efficacy and
      safety of arbidol in the treatment of 2019-ncov infected pneumonia, this study is planned.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, Wuhan, in Hubei province, China, became the center of an outbreak of
      pneumonia of unknown cause. In a short time, Chinese scientists had shared the genome
      information of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from these pneumonia patients and developed a
      real-time reverse transcription PCR (real time RT-PCR) diagnostic assay. The number of cases
      of infection with 2019-nCoV identified in Wuhan increased markedly over the later part of
      January 2020, with cases identified in multiple other Provinces of China and internationally.
      Mathematical models of the expansion phase of the epidemic suggested that sustained
      person-to-person transmission is occurring, and the R-zero is substantially above 1, the
      level required for a self-sustaining epidemic in human populations.

      There is currently no specific treatment for 2019-ncov-infected pneumonia. Arbidol tablet is
      a non-nucleoside broad-spectrum antiviral drug with immune-enhancing effect. Abidor is
      pharmacodynamic in vitro against a variety of coronaviruses.This is a randomized, open,
      multicenter clinical study of pneumonic subjects diagnosed with 2019-ncov infection. The main
      objective was to compare the viral negative conversion rate in the first week after the
      subjects were randomized to arbidol plus basic treatment.

      In this study, 380 eligible patients with pneumonia diagnosed with 2019-ncov infection were
      randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups at a 1:1 ratio.

      patients will receive one of two treatment regimens: A .Abidor tablets + basic treatment B.
      basic treatment Arbidol tablets: take 2 tablets/time, 3 times/day for 14-20 days Basic
      treatment :The basic treatment used by the investigator was based on the condition of the
      patient.
