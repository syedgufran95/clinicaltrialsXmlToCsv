  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is a live attenuated vaccine administered for prevention of
      tuberculosis. Recently, several groups have hypothesized that BCG may &quot;train&quot; the immune
      system to respond to a variety of unrelated infections, including viruses and in particular
      the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19. Trials are currently being conducted in Australia,
      Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom to evaluate its effectiveness.

      Front line workers includes members of municipal and provincial police services, emergency
      medical personnel, firefighters, public transport employees, health service workers and food
      manufacturing employees. They are at high risk of infection from COVID-19, with potentially
      high infection rate. The investigators propose an interventional trial to evaluate the
      effectiveness of BCG vaccination to prevent COVID-19 infection and reduce its severity in
      front-line employees in Ontario.
