  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel coronavirus was identified in late 2019 in Wuhan, China On 11 February, The
      International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) announced that the official
      classification of the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is called severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on the same day
      that the official name of the disease caused by the virus is Corona Virus Disease-19
      (COVID-19). WHO has declared the infection a Pandemic on March 11, 2020. Based on previous
      studies on SARS in 2003 and SARS-MERS 2013 there was a genetic polymorphism associated with
      the susceptibility and severity of the disease.

      Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a cytokine secreted by activated phagocytes and dendritic cells. It
      plays a pivotal role in promoting Th1-type immune responses and cell-mediated immunity. IL-12
      triggers many biological functions: it stimulates the proliferation of activated T- and
      NK-cells, enhances T- and NK-cell-mediated cytolytic activity, and induces the production of
      IFN-γ by both T-and NK-cells. The interferon-γ production induced by IL-12 forms a major link
      between innate and adaptive immunity. A recent study revealed that interferon-mediated
      immunopathological events are associated with atypical innate and adaptive immune responses
      in SARS patients.

      Also, TNF-α is a key mediator of the inflammatory response and is critical for host defense
      against a wide variety of pathogenic microbes. However, the over-expression of this cytokine
      may lead to badness in disease recovery. The dual role of TNF, acting as an agent of both
      innate immunity and inflammatory pathology, poses a considerable challenge for gene
      regulation.
