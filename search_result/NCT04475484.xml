  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The coronavirus outbreak is a stressful event for the whole population. Confinement measures
      are protective against the risk of dissemination of the virus, but they can also lead to
      several psychological symptoms. In children, a study in China has reported about 20% of
      depressive or anxious troubles in school-age children after a 4-week period of confinement.

      In France, confinement lasted about 8 weeks. School resumed on May 11th for primary school
      children and on June 2nd for secondary school children.

      In this survey, we aim at exploring the psychological status of these children and the impact
      on their schooling, for better understanding, support and prevention. Through this online
      questionnaire, we also aim at giving some psycho-education advices. Finally, we could
      identify some subgroups of children particularly vulnerable, and organise some specific
      support for them in coming months.
