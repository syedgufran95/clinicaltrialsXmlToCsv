  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective observational study, a quantitative and qualitative analysis of
      antibiotic prescriptions for presumed respiratory tract (super)infection in patients
      hospitalized on COVID-19 wards will be made.

      Drivers of antibiotic prescription for presumed respiratory tract infection in patients
      suspected of being infected with COVID-19 or with definite COVID-19 infections will be
      identified.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients hospitalized on a COVID-19 ward for more than 24 hours will be included. Those with
      one or more antimicrobial prescription(s) for a presumed respiratory tract (super)infection
      will be identified and every antibiotic dose will be scored as appropriate, inappropriate,
      suboptimal or unnecessary by at least two infectious disease (ID) specialists, on an
      independent manner. If the scoring of the two ID specialists will defer, a third ID
      specialist will come to a conclusion after discussion with the two other ID specialists.

      A quantification of the total amount of antibiotics, prescribed for presumed respiratory
      tract (super)infection will be made for patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis, but also a
      quantification for every category of appropriateness will be made.

      Possible drivers like the degree of hypoxemia, laboratory parameters, qSOFA score, duration
      of symptoms, age, comorbidities, symptoms,... associated with the prescription of
      antimicrobials for a presumed respiratory tract (sur)infection will be identified.
