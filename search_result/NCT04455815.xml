  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II/III randomised, multi-centre, prospective, open label, community-based
      clinical trial. The trial aims to recruit patients who test positive for COVID-19 but who
      have mild disease and therefore can treat their symptoms in the community. Patients who seek
      testing and have a confirmed positive test result will be invited to enrol in the trial.

    <textblock>
      Coronavirus-induced disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is a highly
      contagious disease with a high and unpredictable morbidity and mortality, for which there is
      currently no specific treatment. Progression from a mild fatigue, fever and cough, to severe
      respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation may occur 1 to 2 weeks into the disease.
      This provides a window of opportunity in which patients in the early phase of the disease
      could be treated with a disease-modifying agent, to halt disease progression, prevent
      hospital admissions with respiratory failure and prevent death.

      Camostat is a serine protease inhibitor in clinical use in Japan since 1985 to treat patients
      with chronic pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and has an acceptable safety
      profile. Camostat has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry into epithelial cells in vitro.
      A trial of this repurposed drug for treatment of COVID-19 in humans is urgently required to
      assess its impact on disease progression to respiratory failure and whether it can reduce
      mortality.

      The trial has a pilot phase and then a continuation phase. Patients will be randomised into a
      treatment arm (camostat tablets) or control arm (best supportive care). Patients will be
      called daily at home for 14 days by the clinical trial team to collect symptoms and record
      the general well-being of the patient. The primary aim of this trial is to determine if
      camostat can reduce the clinical progression of COVID-19 and therefore the need for hospital
      admission and supplemental oxygen. Secondary aims include collection of patient reported
      health status, severity of symptoms and biological markers of the virus. As the understanding
      of COVID-19 develops and improves, the inclusion criteria may be adapted to support the trial
      outcomes. Patients will be recruited through various settings which may include primary care
      'COVID-19 hub' clinics, COVID-19 community-based testing centres or other clinical
      environments.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient willing and able to give informed consent

          -  Adults, 50 years of age and above

          -  Typical symptoms of COVID-19 infection (i.e. fever &gt; 37.8 Â°C, and/or persistent dry
             cough and/or shortness of breath)

          -  Evidence of current COVID-19 infection from a validated assay

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant electrolyte disturbance (e.g. hyperkalaemia, potassium &gt;5.0 mmol/L )

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or Alkaline
             Phosphatase (ALP) &gt; 2.5 x ULN

          -  Any condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, will prevent adequate compliance
             with trial therapy e.g. mild cognitive impairment (unable to follow instructions for
             self-assessment readings as assessed by the Investigator)

          -  Patients on long term supplementary oxygen requirement (patients for whom hospital
             admission would not be considered e.g. care plan in the community is in place, are not
             excluded)

          -  Known hypersensitivity to camostat

          -  Platelet count &lt;100 x 109/L

          -  Co-enrolment with a Clinical Trial of an Investigational Medicinal Product (CTIMP)
             will not be permitted. Co-enrolment with a clinical investigation of a Medical Device
             or a non-interventional clinical study will be considered on a study-by-study basis
             and in discussion with the relevant Chief Investigators and Sponsors and industrial
             collaborators.

          -  Co-enrolment involving non-interventional research (including questionnaire or tissue
             only studies) will be allowed provided this is not expected to affect the outcomes of
             both studies or place undue burden upon participants and their families.

          -  Female patients who are able to become pregnant (or are already pregnant or
             lactating). However, those patients who are of child bearing potential and have a
             negative serum or urine pregnancy test before enrolment and agree to use two forms of
             contraception (one effective form plus a barrier method [oral, injected or implanted
             hormonal contraception and condom; intra-uterine device and condom; diaphragm with
             spermicidal gel and condom]) or agree to sexual abstinence*, effective from the first
             administration of camostat, throughout the trial and for 28 days afterwards are
             considered eligible.

        (*Abstinence is only considered to be an acceptable method of contraception when this is in
        line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g.,
        calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not
        acceptable methods of contraception.) 10. Male patients with partners of child-bearing
        potential (unless they agree to take measures not to father children by using a barrier
        method of contraception [condom plus spermicide] or to sexual abstinence* effective from
        the first administration of camostat, throughout the trial and for 28 days afterwards. Men
        with partners of child-bearing potential must also be willing to ensure that their partner
        uses an effective method of contraception for the same duration for example, hormonal
        contraception, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicidal gel or sexual abstinence).
        Men with pregnant or lactating partners must be advised to use barrier method contraception
        (for example, condom plus spermicidal gel) to prevent exposure of the foetus or neonate.

        (*Abstinence is only considered to be an acceptable method of contraception when this is in
        line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g.,
        calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not
        acceptable methods of contraception.)

          -  Significant cardiovascular disease (as assessed via the participant's medical record
             and history) as defined by:

               1. History of congestive heart failure requiring therapy (New York Heart Association
                  [NYHA] III or IV)

               2. History of unstable angina pectoris or myocardial infarction up to 6 months prior
                  to trial entry

               3. Presence of severe valvular heart disease

               4. Presence of a ventricular arrhythmia requiring treatment

          -  Known allergic reactions to components of camostat e.g., lactose intolerance
