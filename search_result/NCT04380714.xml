      of Justice) from March 17, including suspension of visiting rooms and activities in
      detention.

      Containment provides boredom and isolation with many potential consequences: sleep
      disturbance, anxiety, PTSD, depression, suicide, addictive behavior and violence.

      population.

      substances by prisoners at the Villeneuve Les Maguelone prison.

        -  Collection of socio-demographic data

        -  Collection of consumption data before and during containment
