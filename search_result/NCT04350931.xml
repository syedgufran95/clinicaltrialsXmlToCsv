      Phase III Placebo-controlled adaptive multi-centre randomized controlled trial Interventional
      (Clinical Trial). The study will include nine hundred healthcare workers in the isolation
      hospitals for COVID-19 cases; they will be randomly assigned to receive either BCG vaccine or
      normal saline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nine hundred healthcare workers will be randomly assigned to receive intradermal injection of
      either BCG vaccine or normal saline.

      During the study:

        1. Mantoux Tuberculin skin testing (will be done prior to administration of the BCG vaccine
           in the first group by intradermally injecting 0.1 mL of liquid containing 5 TU
           (tuberculin units) of purified protein derivative (PPD) in the volar aspect of the left
           forearm. The test is being read after 48-72 hrs. A positive tuberculin test is defined
           as induration â‰¥10 mm.

        2. Participants will be assessed clinically on daily basis for COVID 19 infection in the
           form of: fever, dry cough, fatigue, &amp; dyspnea.

        3. PCR sampling for COVID-19 will be withdrawn for all participants at the end of the
           study.

        4. The duration of follow-up for each participant depends on the interim results of the
           primary endpoint and the probability of obtaining a result, with a maximum of 6 months.

      Randomization method:

      A block-randomization scheme will be generated by computer software. Participants will be
      randomized between 0.10 mL intradermal injection of BCG vaccine or placebo normal saline in a
      2:1 ratio (600 will receive BCG &amp; 300 will receive placebo saline). In Egypt, the available
      BCG vaccine is the Copenhagen (Danish strain).

      End point of the study:

        -  Primary endpoint: Confirmed COVID-19 infection

        -  Secondary endpoint: number of days of (unplanned) absenteeism for any reason.

        -  Tertiary endpoints: number of days of (unplanned) absenteeism because of documented
           COVID-19 infection, and the cumulative incidence of hospital admission, ICU admission,
           and mortality.
