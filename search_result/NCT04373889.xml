  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The novel SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated Coronavirus type 2) is
      rapidly spreading over the world causing a condition called Coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19). Hospital health care workers (HCW) have received detailed instructions to protect
      themselves against this infection, but it is likely that at least some of the HCW will get
      infected either at their workplace or elsewhere. It would be useful to document prevalence
      and seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and their monthly evolution among Belgian active hospital
      HCW during a period of 5 months starting beginning of April 2020 and the number of new cases
      (incidence) of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 seroconversions among Belgian hospital HCW during a
      period of 5 months which are the primary objectives of this study.

      Additionally the study will validate serological tests (subject to change/addition depending
      on the evolution of scientific research) against the plaque reduction neutralization test
      (PRNT) (gold standard); validate the saliva sample (sampling with Oracol or equivalent)
      against the standard naso/oro pharyngeal swabbing (NOPS) to perform RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2
      diagnostic purposes, as well as against the standard serology (serum); validate the nasal
      swab against the standard (NOPS) to perform RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 for diagnostic purposes;
      investigate potential risk factors for the infection; quantify the proportion of asymptomatic
      cases among new cases that develop during a period of 5 months; investigate virus shedding in
      urine, feces and sperm as well as cellular immune response (sub-study in the Antwerp region
      on volunteering SARS-CoV-2 positive HCW).

      To reach these primary and secondary objectives the researchers will conduct a prospective
      cohort study in which a random selection of HCW currently working in Belgian hospitals will
      be tested monthly (with for the first month an additional testing point at 14 days). The
      testing will include four kind of laboratory tests, being; a molecular (PCR) test on a
      nasopharyngeal, a saliva and nasal sample (for nasal and saliva sample only testing until 50
      PCR positive and 50 PCR negative samples are collected) and a serological test for which a
      blood sample is needed. To asses risk factors, at each testing point a questionnaire
      providing basic socio-demographic and health characteristics of the HCW including presence of
      symptoms since the previous testing point and the HCW's involvement in caring for COVID-19
      patients will be completed.

      Laboratory data and epidemiological data (questionnaire) will be collected simultaneously. In
      each of the participating hospitals, one contact person will be designated to coordinate the
      study locally (ideally a staff member of the local infection and prevention control team) and
      communicate with the researchers. The sample size calculation indicated the inclusion of 16
      randomly selected Belgian hospitals and in each hospital 50 randomly selected HCW. HCW can
      only be enrolled in the study after give a written informed consent.

      Laboratory testing will be performed at the Virology Diseases and Immune Response services of
      Sciensano, Ukkel, and the Virology Laboratory of the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp.
      The laboratory test results will be communicated by the laboratory to each participant. Each
      participant and sample will have a unique code assigned. Data collected through the
      questionnaire will be send psuedonymised (using the unique code) to the epidemiologist at
      Sciensano. The laboratory will prepare a list of test results by unique code to be linked for
      further analysis with the questionnaire data. None of the researchers who will analyse the
      data will be involved in data collection, nor in the care of COVID-19 patients.

      This study is a Belgian multicentric study executed by Sciensano, Brussels, in collaboration
      with the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp.

        Study population include health care workers currently working in Belgian hospitals.

        According to current national guidelines, HCW in contact with persons at risk for COVID-19
        experiencing mild respiratory symptoms without fever are allowed to work if clinical
        condition permits, while wearing a mask and observing usual hygiene measures. Healthcare
        workers experiencing respiratory symptoms and fever are systematically tested and if
        positive, isolated at home, if negative, eventually working wearing a mask if the clinical
        state allows it. Those who recovered from a documented infection are also allowed to work.
        HCW who are not in contact with persons at risk for COVID-19 are not tested and
        systematically isolated in case of any unusual respiratory symptom. This implies that at
        baseline, the study population will only include asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic HCW
        applying proper infection prevention measures.
