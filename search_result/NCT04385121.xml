  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hospitalization of a patient in intensive care is a traumatic experience for his family
      members.

      With the current COVID-19 epidemic, in view of the high risk of contamination, drastic
      measures to limit the transmission are necessary, with the creation of spaces dedicated to
      the care of Covid+ patients, and family are not allowed to visit.

      At the Strasbourg University Hospital, visits were prohibited from the start of the epidemic.
      Information concerning the patient's state of health is therefore delivered to families by
      telephone, on call by the healthcare team only, every day before 6 p.m. or in the event of a
      serious event at any time.

      The primary purpose of this project is to assess the psychological impact of the
      hospitalization of a loved one in intensive care for Covid-19 infection at 3 months
      post-hospitalization, in a context of pandemic with ban on visits.
