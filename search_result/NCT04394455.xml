  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to determine the effect of two behavioral
      interventions: brief cognitive-behavioral therapy and crisis intervention therapy through
      telepsychiatry, over the level of perceived stress, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic
      stress symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in medical residents and medical staff at three
      hospitals in two cities of Honduras.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The psychotherapeutic interventions are going to be delivered from June to August at each
      participating center. Subjects will be allocated randomly in each of the two interventional
      arms independently by stratification in each participating center. The population for
      intervention will be medical staff from three different national hospitals in the frontline
      during the pandemic. After valid informed consent, a screening process will take place to
      identify symptoms as baseline evaluation using validated self-assessment tools delivered
      through electronic invitation. Post-intervention measurements will take place at 3 and 6
      months from baseline. Intention to treat analysis and per-protocol analysis will take place.
      CONSORT guidelines were followed.

    <intervention_model_description>The interventional models are brief cognitive behavioral therapy and crisis intervention therapy through telepsychiatry. Each arm will be divided into therapy groups with a maximum of 10 participants per group. Each therapy session will be directed by a therapist and a co-therapist using a predefined structure for each intervention, with a duration of 60-90 minutes per session.</intervention_model_description>
