      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of administration of plasma containing
      antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus (i.e., convalescent plasma) and if it is able to prevent
      disease or lessen the severity of disease in individuals who are at high risk of developing
      COVID-19 due to a recent exposure. This study will also measure the level of anti-SARS-CoV-2
      antibodies in patient's blood after the administration of the convalescent plasma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People who become infected with a virus such as SARS-CoV-2 usually develop an immune response
      and produce antibodies against the virus. Antibodies are natural proteins made by the body's
      immune system that attack viruses and other germs. These antibodies are found in plasma,
      which is the yellow, clear part of the blood. There have been other studies using plasma to
      treat other types of viruses that showed some positive results. Human plasma containing
      antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus is an option for prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
      This type of treatment, known as passive antibody therapy, could be rapidly available when
      there are sufficient numbers of people who have recovered from infection and can donate
      antibody-containing plasma. In contrast to vaccination strategies, which begin to provide
      protection weeks after administration, antibody-containing plasma would provide its
      protective benefits immediately. Additionally, passive antibody therapy may be the only way
      to provide immunity for some immunocompromised patients who do not respond to vaccines.

      This research will evaluate the safety of administration of plasma containing antibodies to
      the SARS-CoV-2 virus (i.e., convalescent plasma). The research will also measure the level of
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patient's blood after the administration of the convalescent
      plasma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Between 1 month and 18 years of age at the time of consent.

          -  Determined to be at high-risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 disease based on the American
             Academy of Pediatrics definition of immunocompromised children and reported high-risk
             Pediatric subpopulations. These include the following groups: Immunocompromised,
             Hemodynamically significant cardiac disease {e.g. congenital heart disease}, Lung
             disease with chronic respiratory failure, Infant, i.e. child ≤1 year old.

          -  Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection OR high-risk exposure as defined:

               1. Confirmed infection: Child who tested positive for COVID-19 and is no more than
                  96 hours after onset of symptoms (and within 120 hours at the time of receipt of
                  plasma).
