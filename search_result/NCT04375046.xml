      B38-CAP is a bacteria-derived ACE2-like enzyme that suppresses hypertension and cardiac
      dysfunction Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is critically involved in cardiovascular
      physiology and pathology, and is currently clinically evaluated to treat acute lung failure.
      Here we show that the B38-CAP, a carboxypeptidase derived from Paenibacillus sp. B38, is an
      ACE2-like enzyme to decrease angiotensin II levels in mice. In protein 3D structure analysis,
      B38-CAP homolog shares structural similarity to mammalian ACE2 with low sequence identity. In
      vitro, recombinant B38-CAP protein catalyzed the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin
      1-7, as well as other known ACE2 target peptides. Treatment with B38-CAP suppressed
      angiotensin II-induced hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis in mice. Moreover,
      B38-CAP inhibited pressure overload-induced pathological hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis,
      and cardiac dysfunction in mice. A study demonestrated that the bacterial B38-CAP as an
      ACE2-like carboxypeptidase, indicating that evolution has shaped a bacterial carboxypeptidase
      to a human ACE2-like enzyme. Bacterial engineering could be utilized to design improved
      protein drugs for hypertension and heart failure. On the other hand, Treatment with
      recombinant human ACE2 protein (rhACE2), which is devoid of its membrane-anchored domain thus
      soluble, has been demonstrated to exhibit beneficial effects in various animal models
      including heart failure, acute lung injury, and diabetic nephropathy, and so forth. rhACE2 is
      currently tested in the clinic to treat ARDS and COVID-19 infected patients . Using cell
      cultures and organoids, researchers from the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and the
      University of British Columbia (UBC) in Canada, showed that by adding a genetically modified
      variant of ACE2, called human recombinant soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hrsACE2),
      COVID-19 was prevented from entering cells.The paper, published in Cell, shows that hrsACE2
      had a dose dependent effect of viral growth of SARS-CoV-2 and was able to reduce it by a
      factor of 1,000 to 5,000 in cell cultures. Despite its beneficial effects, rhACE2 is a
      glycosylated protein and thus its preparation requires time- and cost-consuming protein
      expression system with mammalian or insect cells, which may not be advantageous in drug
      development and medical economy Although it had been reported that an immune response is
      associated with the chronic infusion of rhACE2 resulting in the degradation of rhACE226, this
      was not observed for B38-CAP; there were no antibodies against B38-CAP detectable in the
      serum of mice infused with B38-CAP for 2 weeks.B38-CAP is easily prepared with E. coli
      expression system and is cost effective. with therapeutic efficacy and less toxicity in mouse
      heart failure model. Implantation of B38-CAP-filled osmotic mini-pumps significantly
      suppressed Ang II-induced hypertension in conscious mice .without affecting the heart rate.
      These results indicate that B38-CAP antagonizes the vasopressor effect of Ang II. So the
      principle investigator expects and suggests that treating with cloned Bacterial ACE2
      receptors -like enzyme of B38-CAP could be promising COVID-19 infection- and lung injury
      preventing drug better than recombinant human ACE2 in addition to brsACE2, expected to lure
      the virus to attach itself to the copy instead of the actual cells… It distracts the virus
      from infecting the cells to the same degree and should lead to a reduction in the growth of
      the virus in the lungs and other organs. A study showed that recombinant B38-CAP protein
      downregulates Ang II levels in mice and antagonizes Ang II-induced hypertension, pathological
      cardiac hypertrophy, and myocardial fibrosis. We also show beneficial effects of B38-CAP on
      the pathology of pressure overload-induced heart failure in mice without overt
      toxicities.Finally the principal investigator expect that treatment with ACE2-like enzyme in
      bacteria B38-CAP may be do the same mechanism of rhACE2 in inhibiting COVID -19 and the other
      suggested mechanism is that injection of ACE2-like enzyme of bacteria B38-CAP in human body
      may down regulate human ACE2 which is the real receptor of COVID -19 and in the same time it
      will be resistant to COVID- spike protein because there seems a difference in substrate
      specificity between two enzymes.

      While the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is spreading across the world, infecting more than one
      million people, the fact that no specific drug or vaccine exists against any of the
      coronaviruses including the SARS, MERS and the novel coronavirus is creating fear among the
      people. world's COVID-19 count rises sharply day by day (active cases count more than one
      million people . Hydroxychloroquine is the only ray of hope now-a-days, along with different
      vaccine trials and passive immunisation therapy using 'convalescent plasma', target-specific
      drug discovery is of paramount importance right now.It has been well-known that SARS-CoV-2
      appears to be optimized for binding to the human receptor ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme
      2). The spike (S) glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV binds ACE2 with higher affinity than SARS-CoV S.
      Wrapp et al., (2020) also tested several published SARS-CoV RBD (receptor binding
      domain)-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to
      2019-nCoV S. ACE2 is expressed in a variety of different tissues including both the upper and
      lower respiratory tract, myocardium and the gastrointestinal mucosa.

      hrsACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection:-

      The researchers used blood vessel and kidney organoids to demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 can
      directly infect and multiply within these tissues, a possible cause of the multi-organ
      failures and cardiovascular damage seen in severe COVID-19 cases. The addition of hrsACE2
      also reduced the SARS-CoV-2 infection in these organoids. the paper, published in Cell, shows
      that hrsACE2 had a dose dependent effect of viral growth of SARS-CoV-2 and was able to reduce
      it by a factor of 1,000 to 5,000 in cell cultures.

      Said Ali Mirazimi, adjunct professor at the Department of Laboratory Medicine at Karolinska
      Institutet and one of the study's corresponding authors. &quot;We believe adding this enzyme copy,
      hrsACE2, lures the virus to attach itself to the copy instead of the actual cells… It
      distracts the virus from infecting the cells to the same degree and should lead to a
      reduction in the growth of the virus in the lungs and other organs.&quot; But treating with
      according to Bacterial ACE2 receptors -like enzyme of B38-CAP could be promising COVID-19
      infection- and lung injury preventing drug better than recombinant human ACE2 as rhACE2 is a
      glycosylated protein and thus its preparation requires time- and cost-consuming protein
      expression system with mammalian or insect cells, which may not be advantageous in drug
      development and medical economy Although it had been reported that an immune response is
      associated with the chronic infusion of rhACE2 resulting in the degradation of rhACE226, this
      was not observed for B38-CAP; there were no antibodies against B38-CAP detectable in the
      serum of mice infused with B38-CAP for 2 weeks. Implantation of B38-CAP-filled osmotic
      mini-pumps significantly suppressed Ang II-induced hypertension in conscious mice without
      affecting the heart rate. These results indicate that B38-CAP antagonizes the vasopressor
      effect of Ang II. So the principle investigator expects and suggests that treating with
      Recombinant Bacterial ACE2 receptors -like enzyme of B38-CAP could be promising COVID-19
      infection- and lung injury preventing drug better than recombinant human ACE2 in addition to
      brsACE2, expected to lure the virus to attach itself to the copy instead of the actual cells…
      It distracts the virus from infecting the cells to the same degree and should lead to a
      reduction in the growth of the virus in the lungs and other organs.

      This is a small pilot study investigating whether there is any efficacy signal that warrants
      a larger Phase 2B trial, or any harm that suggests that such a trial should not be done. It
      is not expected to produce statistically significant results in the major endpoints. The
      investigator will examine all of the biologic, physiological, and clinical data to determine
      whether a Phase 2B trial is warranted.

      Primary efficacy analysis will be carried only on patients receiving at least 4 doses of
      active drug. Safety analysis will be carried out on all patients receiving at least one dose
      of active drug.

      It is planned to enroll more than or equal to 24 subjects with COVID-19. It is expected to
      have at least 12 evaluable patients in each group.

      Experimental group: 0.4 mg/kg rbACE2 IV BID and standard of care Control group: standard of
      care Intervention duration: up to 7 days of therapy No planned interim analysis.
