  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, there is no efficient therapeutics to prevent or treat COVID-19 related pulmonary
      failure. Corticosteroids (CS) could be a helpful therapeutic. Retrospective reports suggested
      survival improvement in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). CT scan for
      COVID19 hospitalized patients showed sometimes unusual aspects of pneumonia, suggestive of an
      organizing phase of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD).

      We hypothesize that, in the context of alveolar aggression induced by COVID-19, CT scan could
      help to individualize patients with a high probability of pulmonary organizing process who
      could benefit from CS treatment.

    <textblock>
      &quot;Severe acute respiratory syndrome&quot; coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) is a new coronavirus that
      induces pneumonia called Corona Virus Disease- 19 (COVID-19), an infected 1.5 million people
      worldwide and caused the more than 85,000 patients died. COVID-19 usually comes in the form
      of viral pneumonia but with the peculiarities of a risk frequent worsening towards acute
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and a usual duration of oxygen dependence in fragile
      patients by their age or their comorbidities. To date, there is no therapy effective in
      preventing or treating COVID-19. Drug identification is a major concern and a public health
      emergency. Retrospective study (Wu 2020) highlighted improved survival in COVID-19 patients
      with acute ARDS and treated with corticosteroids (CS). So even in the absence of evidence of
      effectiveness, the SCs are used for COVID-19 oxygen-dependent patients or with an ARDS.
      However, their benefit / risk remains debated (Russel 2020). On histological samples of
      COVID-19, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) has been especially observed (Hanley 2020). DAD is
      described histologically in an exudative phase, an organizational phase and a irreversible
      fibrotic phase (Hughes 2017). SC could have an effect beneficial by limiting the exudative /
      inflammatory phase but also that organization whose histological and CT aspects are sometimes
      indistinguishable from organized pneumonia, a form of pulmonary repair aberrant very
      corticosensitive (Travis 2013). Chest scans performed in the face of the persistence or
      worsening of oxygen dependence beyond the 7th day of COVID-19 symptoms, could help discern
      indirect complications (pulmonary embolism, exacerbation of COPD, bacterial superinfection,
      etc.) of an unfavorable course COVID-19 (by displaying an aspect suggesting DAD in particular
      during the organization phase). We hypothesize that, in the context of COVID-19, the SCs may
      be beneficial in patients with CT scans thoracic images suggestive of DAD either at the
      exudative phase or at the pulmonary organization phase.
