  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recent report in Physiolological Reviews proposed that the endogenous protease plasmin acts
      on SARS-CoV-2 by cleaving a newly inserted furin site in the S protein portion of the virus
      resulting in increased infectivity and virulence. A logical treatment that might blunt this
      process would be the inhibition of the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. Fortunately,
      there is an inexpensive, commonly used drug, tranexamic acid, TXA, which suppresses this
      conversion and could be re-purposed for the treatment of COVID-19. TXA is a synthetic analog
      of the amino acid lysine which reversibly binds four to five lysine receptor sites on
      plasminogen. This reduces conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, and is normally used to
      prevent fibrin degradation. TXA is FDA approved for the outpatient treatment of heavy
      menstrual bleeding (typical dose 1300 mg p.o. TID x 5 days) and off-label use for many other
      indications. TXA is used perioperatively as a standard-of-care at UAB for orthopedic and
      cardiac bypass surgeries. It has a long track record of safety such that it is used
      over-the-counter in other countries as an antiviral and for the treatment of cosmetic
      dermatological disorders. Given the potential benefit and limited toxicity of TXA it would
      appear warranted to perform randomized, double-blind placebo controlled exploratory trial at
      UAB as a prophylactic antiviral treatment following exposure to COVID-19 in order to
      determine whether it reduces infectivity and virulence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as
      hypothesized. Involvement of each patient is only for 7 days before primary endpoints and 30
      days for final data collection.

      Patients who are self-identified as having had close personal contact with an individual who
      has tested positive for COVID-19 will be invited to enroll in the study. On Day 1 they will
      be consented and randomized to one of two arms of the study: Arm 1 will consist of a 5 day
      treatment with tranexamic acid (TXA; 1300 mg p.o. TID x 5 days) and Arm 2 will consist of a 5
      day treatment with an identical appearing placebo. All subjects will be tested using
      nasopharyngeal RNA swabs for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on Days 1 and 7. The
      primary endpoint will be conversion from a negative test for COVID-19 on Day 1, to a positive
      test on Day 7. Secondary data related to symptoms and co-morbidities will also be gathered.

      Subjects who are positive for COVID-19 on Day 1 will not be included in the primary endpoint
      analysis for this study, but will receive the same 5 days of treatment and their data used
      for secondary analyses including safety.

      All subjects in Arm 1 will also be treated with apixaban (5 mg p.o. BID x 5 days) to mitigate
      potential risks associated with hypercoagulability which have been noted in COVID-19 patients
      and which could be made worse with TXA treatment. The subjects in Arm 2 who received placebo
      in place of TXA will receive a second placebo tablet in place of apixaban.

      Patients will be consented via the existent mechanisms associated with outpatient recruitment
      for all COVID-related studies at UAB. Consent would be performed remotely. All nasopharyngeal
      swabs will be obtained through the existent mechanisms for COVID-19 testing at UAB. Follow-up
      would consist of daily phone/internet contact for 7 days unless subjects acquire symptoms
      consistent with COVID-19, in which case they will be followed until resolution of their
      symptoms or for a maximum of 30 days.
