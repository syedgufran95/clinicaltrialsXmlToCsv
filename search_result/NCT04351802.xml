  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study is designed to assess whether focused lung ultrasound examination
      can improve the diagnosis of COVID-19 lung disease and/or make an alternative diagnosis at a
      patient's initial hospital presentation. For patients with confirmed COVID-19 the study will
      also assess whether surveillance lung ultrasound examination can predict clinical outcome
      over the course of their hospital admission.

      Study participants will be screened from and recruited on their entry into the suspected
      COVID-19 admission pathway at Derriford Hospital, Plymouth, UK. In addition to usual clinical
      care (including physical exam and observations, blood tests, nasopharyngeal swab for viral
      PCR testing, and chest x-ray as standard), participants will undergo focused lung ultrasound
      examination.

      Participants who are negative for COVID-19 will be followed up to confirm their final
      discharge diagnoses, and clinical outcome at either 3 months post-enrolment or discharge from
      hospital.

      Participants who are positive for COVID-19 will have regular focused lung ultrasound
      examination during their hospital admission in addition to usual clinical care until their
      treatment for COVID-19 is complete. Their discharge diagnoses and clinical outcome at either
      3 months post-enrolment or discharge from hospital (whichever is later).
