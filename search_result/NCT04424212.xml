      therapy (ICBT) programme a on adult mental health problems related to the current coronavirus

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is set up as a randomized controlled trial. Quality of life, depressive symptoms,
      anxiety, sleep problems and traumatic stress will be measured. Given uncertainties regarding
      the psychological effects of Covid-19 pandemic a transproblematic tailored treatment approach
      will be used that has been tested in several previous trials. However, the present program
      has been adapted for the target population of people who are affected by the societal and
      individual consequences of the pandemic. The study does not focus on people who have or have
      had the corona virus.
