  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the
      COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019) in December 2019 has led to an unprecedented
      international health situation. Exceptional measures have been taken by public authorities
      worldwide in order to slow the spread of the virus and prevent healthcare systems from
      becoming overloaded. In France, a national lockdown has been established during approximately
      2 months to increase social distancing and restrict population movements. Hospital routine
      care appointments have been cancelled, in order to reallocate medical resources towards
      COVID-19 units and limit contacts between patients within hospitals or waiting rooms. While
      the virus itself, the disease and potential treatments are currently extensively studied,
      little data are available on the effect of these public health decisions on the management of
      a chronic condition such as diabetes.

      The French regional CONFI-DIAB study aims at assessing the collateral impact of routine care
      cancellation during the national lockdown due to COVID-19 in patients with a chronic
      condition such as diabetes. Special attention will be given to metabolic control and access
      to health care.

      This cross-sectional study should provide information on the consequences of a global
      lockdown and the associated routine care cancellation on the management of diabetes, and
      inform future decision making in the event of a new pandemic.
