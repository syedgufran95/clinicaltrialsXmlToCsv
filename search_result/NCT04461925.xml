      Assessment of the clinical effects of infusions of cryopreserved allogeneic multipotent
      mesenchymal stem cells of the placenta and umbilical cord for COVID-19 patients with acute
      respiratory distress syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, cell-based therapy and especially stem cell therapy has become a promising
      therapeutic field, in which many see opportunities to cure incurable diseases. Severe
      respiratory consequences of the COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2
      coronavirus, have prompted urgent need for novel therapies.

      Cell-based approaches, primarily using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), have demonstrated
      safety and efficacy in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) - common
      manifestation of cytokine storms, and the cause of death in many COVID-19 patients.

      Mesenchymal stem cells are a powerful immunomodulator, they secrete many anti-inflammatory
      biologically active substances (cytokines) that reduce the inflammatory process in the lungs.
      Also mesenchymal stem cells secrete numerous growth factors that contribute to the recovery
      of not only the affected lung tissue but also other organs.
