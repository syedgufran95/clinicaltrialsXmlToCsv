  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to investigate the effect of Famotidine in the symptomatic recovery of
      the different degrees of COVID-19 patients. COVID19 is a worldwide pandemic. Hence SARS-CoV-2
      is a novel virus; there is no specific medication against it. Like other countries of the
      world, Besides antiviral drugs, immunosuppressive agents, and symptomatic therapy like H2
      receptor blocker FAMOTIDINE came to limelight due to its role in reducing the symptoms of
      COVID-19 patients. The study will include COVID-19 participants to confirm by RT PCR or an
      HRCT chest. Detail history of each participant with comorbidity will be taken and will be
      examined carefully. Both the hospitalized and OPD patients will be enrolled in this study.
      Seriously ill patients who require ventilation will not be included in this study. The
      outcome of the Famotidine treatment will be evaluated and compared with a control group.

    <description>The number of participants with &quot;Symptomatic improvement&quot; determined by the change of individual presenting symptoms of the COVID-19 disease. Major symptoms, fever, cough, respiratory distress, chest tightness, sore throat, and myalgia will be rerecorded daily. This will be done by the investigators in the case of the hospitalized patients and the patient itself by a daily self assessment cart in the case of OPD patients.</description>

    <description>The number of participants with &quot;Clinical status (Stable or Deteriorate clinical state)&quot; determined by the chart or the judgment of the investigators. This will be defined as OPD patients require hospitalization, Hospitalized patients require High Dependency Unit (HDU), and an HDU patient requiring Ventilator or Intensive care support.</description>

    <measure>Adverse effects</measure>
    <time_frame>Following randomization 15 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants with &quot;adverse effects&quot; determined by the existence of the pharmacological side effects of the particular drug (Famotidine) during treatment.
The adverse effect will define as the symptoms expressed by the participants following the starting of the treatment other than the disease symptoms, those are within the proven/enlisted pharmacological side effects of the particular drug therapy. Adverse effects will be evaluated by the investigators during follow-ups or communication on phone or during the final collection of the recovery chart.</description>
