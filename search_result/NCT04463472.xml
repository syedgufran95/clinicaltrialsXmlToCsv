      This study will assess the safety and immunogenicity of AG0301-COVID19 in healthy adult
      volunteers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, single-center, non-randomised, open-label, non-controlled trial.
      Approximately 30 healthy volunteers, male or female, aged 20-65, will be enrolled in the low
      dose group for the first 15 and the high dose group for the remaining 15.

      Low dose group: 1.0 mg AG0301-COVID19 intramuscular (IM) (n = 15) High dose group: 2.0 mg
      AG0301-COVID19 IM (n = 15)
