    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Cohort Treatment Plan is to allow access to ruxolitinib for eligible
      patients diagnosed with severe/very severe COVID-19 illness. The patient's Treating Physician
      should follow the suggested treatment guidelines and comply with all local health authority
      regulations.

      The requesting Treating Physician submitted a request for access to drug (often referred to
      as Compassionate Use) to Novartis which was reviewed and approved by the medical team
      experienced with the drug and indication.

      Please refer to the latest Investigator's Brochure (IB) or approved label for overview of
      ruxolitinib including: non-clinical and clinical experience, risk and benefits. Novartis will
      continue to provide any new safety information to the Treating Physician as they emerge.
