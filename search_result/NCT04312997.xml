    <textblock>
      Adults who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and who do not require supplemental
      oxygen will receive PUL-042 Inhalation Solution or placebo 3 times over a one week period in
      addition to their normal care. Subjects will be be followed and assessed for their clinical
      status over 28 days to see if PUL-042 Inhalation Solution improves the clinical outcome

    <measure>Severity of COVID-19</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the efficacy of PUL-042 Inhalation Solution in decreasing the severity of COVID-19 in subjects: 1) who have documented SARS-CoV-2 infection and, 2) who do not require supplemental oxygen (Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement 3 or less) at the time of enrollment.
The primary endpoint is the difference in the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful worsening of COVID-19 within 28 days from the start of experimental therapy, as indicated by an increase of at least 2 points on the Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement.
The Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement is a nine point scale (0-8) with 0 being no clinical or virological evidence of infection and 8 being death.</description>

    <description>To assess the progression of COVID-19 severity during the study as measured by the SARS-CoV-2 Symptom Score.
The SARS-CoV-2 Symptom Score measures 3 elements on a 0-3 scale (cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, and muscle aches or fatigue) ranging from 0 for none to 3 for severe. The fourth element is fever and it is rated on a 0-4 scale with 0 being no fever and 4 being life-threatening.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must have a positive test for SARS-CoV-2.

          2. COVID-19 signs and symptoms such as (fever, cough, shortness of breath or fatigue)
             with onset within the 7 days prior to Screening

          3. Subjects should be Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement score of 3 or less

          4. Pulse oximetry ≥ 93% on room air

          5. Subjects must be receiving standard of care (SOC) for COVID-19, this includes marketed
             therapies used for COVID-19 treatment.

          6. Subject's spirometry (FEV1 and forced vital capacity [FVC]) must be ≥70% of predicted
             value.

          7. If female, the subject must be surgically sterile or ≥ 1 year postmenopausal. If of
             child-bearing potential (including being &lt; 1years postmenopausal) and, if
             participating in sexual activity that may lead to pregnancy, the subject agrees to use
             an effective dual method of birth control (acceptable methods include intrauterine
             device, spermicide, barrier, male partner surgical sterilization, and hormonal
             contraception) during the study and through 30 days after completion of the study.

          8. If female, must not be pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or nurse a child during the
             study and through 30 days after completion of the study. A pregnancy test must be
             negative at the Screening Visit, prior to dosing on Day 1.

          9. If male, must be surgically sterile or, if not surgically sterile and if participating
             in sexual activities that may lead to pregnancy, be willing to practice two effective
             methods of birth control (acceptable methods include barrier, spermicide, or female
             partner surgical sterilization) during the study and through 30 days after completion
             of the study.

         10. Must have the ability to understand and give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. No documented infection with SARS-CoV-2.

          2. Patients who require oxygen (Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement &gt;3) at the time of
             screening.

          3. Known history of chronic pulmonary disease (e.g., asthma [including atopic asthma,
             exercise-induced asthma, or asthma triggered by respiratory infection], chronic
             pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis, COPD), pulmonary hypertension, or heart
             failure.

          4. Exposure to any investigational therapy (defined as any agent not currently marketed)
             at the time of or within 30 days prior to the Screening Visit.

          5. Any condition which, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, would prevent full
             participation in this trial or would interfere with the evaluation of trial endpoints
