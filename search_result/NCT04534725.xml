  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-centre Australian trial with four arms aims to evaluate several different immune
      modulating drugs for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 specifically in the cancer
      population.

      ARM 1 is evaluating the effect of interferon-alpha (vs placebo) on the incidence of COVID-19
      infection in cancer patients with no COVID-19 infection or no known COVID-19 positive
      contacts.

      ARM 2 is evaluating the effect of interferon-alpha (vs placebo) on the incidence of COVID-19
      infection in cancer patients with confirmed exposure to COVID-19 virus.

      ARM 3 is evaluating the effect of Selinexor (vs placebo) on the incidence of COVID-19
      infection in cancer patients with moderate COVID-19 infection.

      ARM 4 is evaluating the effect of Lenzilumab (vs placebo) on the treatment of COVID-19
      infection in cancer patients with severe COVID-19 infection.

      Participants may become eligible and transition to different arms and treatments if they
      become exposed to COVID-19 or are hospitalised with an active moderate/severe COVID-19
      infection.

      It is hoped this research will provide insight into the best practice for prevention and
      treatment of COVID-19 in cancer patients as emerging standard of care measures are not always
      suitable to this especially vulnerable population.

    <intervention_model_description>the study uses a SMART design. (sequential multiple arm randomised trial) meaning that participants can enter into the study and progress through the subsequent arms if they meet the additional eligibility criteria (for instance, pre-covid &gt; post exposure &gt; develop moderate infection &gt; infection becomes severe) it is important to note that participants can enter into the study at any point and do not have to transition into the other arms</intervention_model_description>
