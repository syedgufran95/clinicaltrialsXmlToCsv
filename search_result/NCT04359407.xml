  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The consensus therapeutic strategy implies that COVID patients with acute lung injury due to
      coronavirus are routinely placed in prone position in an attempt to improve oxygenation by
      increasing ventilation homogeneity. The purpose of the study is to quantify with the
      electrical impedance tomography (EIT) the changes in the ventilation and aeration in the
      dorsal regions of the lung when the patient is placed in prone position.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) frequently develop atelectasis in
      dorsal lung regions because of gravity and the compression by the heart and the diaphragm.
      Since lung perfusion is predominantly distributed in lower lung regions, a reduction of
      ventilation in these areas results in further ventilation-perfusion mismatch, called shunt.
      The development of atelectatic lung regions necessitate the use of higher ventilation
      pressures, which in turn results in excessive transpulmonary pressures and
      ventilation-induced lung injury in the ventral regions. Therefore it is common to promote the
      prone position in patients with ARDS in order to improve ventilation-perfusion matching and
      thus, protect the ventral regions from hyperinflation. In patients with COVID-19-related
      ARDS, the value of such therapeutic strategy based on placing in prone position has not been
      completely elucidated. The aims of the study are to determine whether prone positioning
      improves dorsal regional ventilation when compared to supine position. Moreover, another aim
      is to assess the changes in intrapulmonary shunt following patient position changes.
