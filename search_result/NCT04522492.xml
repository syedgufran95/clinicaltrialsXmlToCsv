  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skin Picking Disorder (SPD) affects up to 10% of the general population, causing significant
      socioeconomic damage in 75% of affected individuals. It is characterized by the repeated
      habit of touching the skin itself, causing or aggravating wounds, with difficulty in
      controlling the habit. It is associated with anxiety disorders in about 20% of cases and with
      depressive disorder in about 50%. Patients with SPD have difficulties in regulating emotions,
      being more vulnerable to having their mental symptoms aggravated in face of stressful
      situations, such as the current coronavirus-19 pandemia. Among the treatments available to
      SPD, cognitive behavioral therapy is the only intervention superior to placebo, and there is
      still no medication approved by the FDA indicated specifically to SPD. The effectiveness of
      cognitive behavioral therapy was assessed in a randomized clinical trial with Brazilian
      patients with SPD, but its long-term benefit has not yet been evaluated. Additionally,
      telemedicine interventions can be effective and used during pandemia, but the effectiveness
      of internet delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for SPD is not clear yet.

      This study is a randomized clinical trial, in which patients diagnosed with skin picking
      disorder (SPD) will be evaluated and, if symptomatic for the disease, will be randomized to
      one of the arms: intervention arm with 2 booster sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy in
      online format; active control arm, in which individuals will watch videos with quality of
      life orientation. Patients included in this study are coming from a brazilian clinical trial
      conducted between the years of 2014 and 2018, in wich patients with SPD were treated with a
      cognitive behavioral treatment protocol in individual or group formats, resulting in
      improvement of SPD symptoms and comorbid anxiety and depression. Before the intervention,
      individuals will be evaluated by a psychiatrist, to assess SPD and comorbid symptoms
      severity, thru the application of some instruments to assess SPD, anxiety, depression and
      emotional regulation. Also, the CRISIS questionnaire, about the impact of COVID-19 in mental
      health, will be applied. After the interventions, the instruments will be applied again, by
      the same evaluator, wich is blinded to the type of intervention that the patient received.

    <description>Internet delivered cognitive behavioral therapy, thru 2 booster sessions. Each session will last 50 minutes. Fist session will involve: psychoeducation about the symptoms, evaluation of the skin picking habit, reinforcement of the habit reversal strategies. After 1 week, the second session will be applied, consisting of: strategies to cope with anxiety (breathing and muscle relaxation techniques) and to cope with depressive status (cognitive restructuring techniques).</description>
