  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-center prospective observational study will examine immune responses to to
      SARS-CoV-2 and how they correlate with its virological characteristics and clinical
      manifestations in infected patients. Household contacts will also be included so that early
      immune responses and viral kinetics can be captured. Patients and contacts will be followed
      for 8 and 2 weeks, respectively. The study will include a maximum of 250 participants.

      The primary aim of this single-center prospective observational study is to establish how
      immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 or to cross-reactive viruses correlate with the virological
      and clinical characteristics of SARS- CoV-2-infected patients and their exposed household
      contacts. Through iterative sampling, the viral kinetics of at least 50 infected patients
      will be evaluated in relation to symptom severity and innate and adaptive immune responses,
      while their household contacts will be observed for viral detection and immune responses.
      Patients and contacts will be followed for 8 and 2 weeks, respectively. The study will
      include a maximum of 250 participants.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The following persons may be included:

          -  A patient of any age meeting the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention's
             confirmed case definition: &quot;A person with laboratory confirmation of virus causing
             COVID-19, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms&quot; (and/or high suspicion/actively
             being treated as CoVID+ cases pending test confirmation)

          -  Household contacts (defined as those sleeping in the same apartment/house as an
             infected patient) of a patient with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (and/or high
             suspicion/actively being treated as CoVID+ cases pending test confirmation), whether
             symptomatic or not, and whether testing positive or not during a period of 14 days

        Exclusion Criterion:

          -  Long-term incapacity leading to the inability to provide informed consent while not
             having a patient representative with the ability to provide informed consent
