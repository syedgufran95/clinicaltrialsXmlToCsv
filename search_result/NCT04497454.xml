  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, single-center, open-label controlled trial, designed to
      compare the efficacy of two ventilation strategies (Low Tidal Volume and positive
      end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) based on the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)
      Network low PEEP-fraction of inspired oxygen inspired oxygen fraction (FIO2) Table versus Low
      Driving Pressure and PEEP guided by Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) in reducing daily
      lung injury score in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by COVID-19.
      The two strategies incorporate different prioritizations of clinical variables. The PEEP-FIO2
      table strategy aims to reduce lung overdistension, even if it requires tolerating worse gas
      exchange. EIT-guided strategy prioritizes mechanical stress protection, avoiding alveolar
      overdistension and collapse.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will follow the ventilator strategy of the ARDS Network low PEEP-FiO2 table in the control
      arm. This strategy consists of at least 12 hours of controlled mechanical ventilation
      following prespecified PEEP and FiO2 combinations chosen dynamically targeting oxygenation.
      Tidal volume is set at 4-6 mL/Kg of predicted body weight (PBW) and plateau pressure is kept
      below 30 centimeters of water (cmH2O). Respiratory rate can be as high as 35 breaths per
      minute titrated to a potential of hydrogen (pH) 7.30-7.45. As oxygenation improves, patients
      are transitioned to assisted ventilation and then to pressure support ventilation until they
      are ready to be liberated from the ventilator. During this phase, no attempt is made to
      control plateau pressures or tidal volumes. In the intervention arm, we will focus on
      minimizing tidal lung strain by keeping driving pressure below 16 cmH2O throughout the
      mechanical ventilation period. The controlled phase will last at least 48 hours. PEEP will be
      selected according to a PEEP titration maneuver with EIT at the start of the intervention.
      This PEEP level will be kept until extubation. Respiratory rate can be as high as 50 breaths
      per minute targeting a pH of 7.15-7.45.

    <description>This score originally ranges from 0 to 4 points based on the average of 4 parameters (PaO2/FiO2, chest X-Ray, PEEP level, and Respiratory compliance). In the modified version, if the patient dies, he or she automatically receives a score of 5 irrespective of the other four parameters. If the patient is extubated, the score is automatically zero. We also substituted FiO2 for PEEP guaranteeing equivalence of the score when either the low or high PEEP-FiO2 table is applied.</description>
