  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This interventional study will investigate the effect of daily use of a mindfulness app on
      measures of participant anxiety, well-being, and future outlook during the Covid-19 pandemic,
      by comparing pre-intervention survey responses to post-intervention survey responses.

    <textblock>
      Question 1: Can 30 days of daily use of a mindfulness app during the Covid-19 pandemic reduce
      anxiety and improve general well-being and future outlook? Outcomes measured: Pre- and
      post-intervention surveys to assess well-being and anxiety (primary outcomes), future
      outlook, hopefulness, and sleep habits (secondary outcomes). Many of these survey questions
      come from well-validated surveys (WHO-5 Well-being survey, GAD7 Anxiety survey). Post
      intervention surveys will be administered at the end of the 30d intervention, as well as 2
      months after the completion of the 30d intervention.

      Question 2: Can 30 days of daily use of a mindfulness app during the Covid-19 pandemic
      improve nutritional habits? Outcomes measured: Pre- and post-intervention surveys to assess
      general nutrition habits, including frequency of consuming whole foods (fruits, vegetables,
      whole grains) and frequency of consuming prepared meals (secondary outcomes). Post
      intervention surveys will be administered at the end of the 30d intervention, as well as 2
      months after the completion of the 30d intervention.

      Question 3: Will study participants be more likely to continue to use the mindfulness app
      after completion of the study? Outcomes measured: Post-intervention survey administered at
      the end of the 30d intervention will be used to assess likelihood to continue using app and
      frequency of anticipated continued use. The post-intervention survey administered 2 months
      after the completion of the 30d intervention will ask if participants continued to use the
      app, and the frequency of use (secondary outcomes).

    <description>Participants will also be given access to the mindfulness app (Insight Timer), and instructed to use it for 10 min daily for 30 days. Two days before the end of the 30 day intervention period, participants will be sent a link to a Google Form for the post-intervention survey and will be asked to complete the survey within the next 3 days. Two months after the conclusion of the 30 day intervention period (90 days after study began), participants will be sent a link to a Google Form for another post-intervention survey, and asked to complete it within 5 days.</description>

Two days before the end of the 30 day no intervention period, participants will be sent a link to a Google Form for the post-intervention survey and will be asked to complete the survey within the next 3 days. After this 30 day no intervention period, participants are invited to use the Insight Timer app if they so choose. Two months after the conclusion of the 30 day no intervention period (90 days after study began), participants will be sent a link to a Google Form for another post-intervention survey, and asked to complete it within 5 days.</description>

    <description>Investigators will confirm eligibility of applicants, enroll participants in the study and provide an identification number for de-identification of the data, and provide a list of mental health resources to participants. Participants will then be sent a link to a Google Form for the pre-intervention survey, to be completed prior to first use of the mindfulness app. Participants will also be given access to the mindfulness app (Insight Timer), and instructed to use it for 10 min daily for 30 days. Two days before the end of the 30 day intervention period, participants will be sent a link to a Google Form for the post-intervention survey and will be asked to complete the survey within the next 3 days. Two months after the conclusion of the 30 day intervention period, participants will be sent a link to a Google Form for another post-intervention survey, and asked to complete it within 5 days.</description>
