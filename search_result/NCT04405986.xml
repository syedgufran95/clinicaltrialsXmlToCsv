    <textblock>
      Although direct evidence is currently lacking, the high identity between SARS-CoV-1 and
      SARS-CoV-2 suggests, that the latter viral strain could also infect the Central Nervous
      System (CNS). Indeed, some cases of SARS-COV2 encephalitis begin to be described and CNS
      damages are increasingly highlighted in the literature, but still not objectified by imaging
      and do not allow to explain the entire clinical patterns. We hypothesise that these CNS
      damages are not always objectified by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) but could be
      indirectly observed by a physiological dysfunction of neural conduction in the brainstem. We
      will explore brainstem disruption through an electrophysiological approach.

      Clinical and preclinical data from studies with other coronaviruses suggest an evident
      neurotropism, which may result in more complex clinical scenarios. Can the SARS-CoV-2 enter
      the Central Nervous System (CNS) and infect neural cells ? And if yes, how the CNS damage
      contributes to pathophysiology of the COVID-19, to its signs, symptoms and progression as
      well as to its sequelae. It has been demonstrated that coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and
      MERS-CoV do not limit their presence to the respiratory tract and frequently invade the CNS.
      The intranasal administration of SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-COV resulted in the rapid invasion of
      viral particles into the brain of mice, possibly through the olfactory bulb via
      trans-synaptic route. The brainstem, which hosts the respiratory neuronal circuit in the
      medulla, was severely infected with both types of viruses, which may contribute to
      degradation and failure of respiratory centres.
