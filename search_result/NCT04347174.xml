    <textblock>
      The trial is randomized, blinded, two arms, active comparator controlled, clinical trial to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of Mycobacterium w in combination with standard care as per
      hospital practice versus standard care alone in critically ill adult patients suffering from
      COVID-19 infection.

      In this study, Eligible patients will be enrolled after due consent and will be randomized in
      balance to receive either test drug (along with the standard of care) or water for injection
      (along with the standard of care). The enrolled patients will be monitored for any adverse
      events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs) throughout the study period. All patients will
      continue to receive standard therapy till considered requisite by the treating physician.

      In addition to the standard care for COVID-19, patients randomized to test arm will receive
      single daily dose of 0.3 ml of Mw, intradermal, for 3 consecutive days while patients
      randomized to control arm will receive single daily dose of 0.3 ml of water for injection,
      intradermal, for 3 consecutive days.

      Study duration for each patient will be 28 days.
