  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown that smokers have a higher risk of developing a severe form of
      COVID-19 once a person has been infected. This is explained by the damage caused by smoking
      at the bronchopulmonary level and an overexpression of some coronavirus receptors at the
      pulmonary level when exposed to tobacco. In contrast, recent data indicate that smokers are
      proportionally less infected with the COVID-19 virus since all available cohort data from
      around the world show a very low rate of smokers among COVID-19 infected subjects. The
      mechanisms at the origin of this protective effect are not known. All of these data lead us
      to question the real role of nicotine in the protective effect of tobacco observed in the
      general population against infection by the COVID-19 virus.

      The objectives are :

        -  To show that subjects taking nicotine substitutes as part of a smoking cessation program
           are less infected with COVID-19 than non-smokers.

        -  To show that active smokers are less infected with COVID-19 than non-smokers.

        -  To compare the percentage of positive serological tests in subjects taking nicotine
           substitutes to the percentage of positive serological tests in active smokers.
