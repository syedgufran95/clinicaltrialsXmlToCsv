    <textblock>
      The objectives of the trial are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of trimodulin as add-on
      therapy to standard of care (SoC) compared to placebo treatment in adult hospitalized
      subjects with severe COVID-19.

      Additionally, pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of trimodulin will be
      evaluated in all subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-center, phase II trial
      investigating the efficacy and safety of trimodulin compared to placebo treatment, as add-on
      therapy to SoC in adult subjects with severe COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 patients with need for
      non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen and with dysregulated inflammatory responses
      demonstrated by an elevated CRP level, will be enrolled.

      Subjects will be randomized to receive either trimodulin or placebo on a 1:1 basis,
      stratified by center. Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) treatments will be blinded.
      Subjects will be administered IMP once daily on five consecutive days (day 1 through day 5)
      as add-on therapy to SoC. The subsequent follow-up phase comprises 23 [+3] days (day 6
      through day 28) followed by an end-of-trial visit/ telephone call on day 29 [+3]. For
      evaluation of this trial, a 9-category ordinal scale will be used. The primary aim of
      trimodulin treatment in the enrolled severely ill patients with a score of 5, is to prevent
      their clinical deterioration to a critical disease stage (score 6-7, e.g. requiring invasive
      mechanical ventilation or ECMO) and death (score 8). Accordingly, a composite primary
      efficacy endpoint reflecting the deterioration / mortality rate is used.
