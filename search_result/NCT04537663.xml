  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On March 11 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
      outbreak a pandemic. Worldwide, the number of confirmed cases continues to rise, leading to
      significant morbidity and mortality. In the Netherlands, although the incidence is currently
      low due to social distancing measures, recurrence of infections is expected once measures are
      going to be lifted. Although individuals of any age can acquire SARS-CoV-2, adults of middle
      and older age are at highest risk for developing severe COVID-19 disease. Moreover, recent
      reports demonstrate that mortality rates rise significantly among patients 60 years and
      older. Therefore, strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection or to reduce its clinical
      consequences in vulnerable populations are urgently needed. Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG)
      vaccine not only protects against tuberculosis, but also induces protection against various
      respiratory infections, including those with a viral etiology. We hypothesize that BCG
      vaccination reduces clinically relevant respiratory tract infections requiring medical
      intervention, including COVID-19, in vulnerable elderly.

      The objective of this trial is to determine the impact of BCG vaccination on the incidence of
      clinically relevant respiratory infections or COVID-19 in vulnerable elderly.

      The trial is designed as an adaptive multi-center double-blind randomized placebo-controlled
      trial. The attempt is to include 5,200 to 7,000 vulnerable elderly, defined as ≥60 years of
      age being discharged from hospital in the last 6 weeks, or visiting a medical outpatient
      clinic, thrombosis care services, or chronic renal replacement departments. Patients with
      contraindications to BCG vaccination as stipulated in the Summary of Product Characteristics
      (SPC) and patients with a history of COVID-19 will be excluded. Participants will be
      randomized between intracutaneous administration of BCG vaccine (Danish strain 1331) or
      placebo (0.1ml 0.9% NaCl) in a 1:1 ratio.The trial has an adaptive primary endpoint. Based on
      accrual of the two endpoints, the primary endpoint will be either (a) COVID-19 or (b)
      clinically relevant respiratory tract infection requiring medical intervention, potentially
      including COVID-19 episodes. The other will be declared secondary endpoint. Other secondary
      endpoints include: all SARS-CoV-2 infections (including asymptomatic infections), influenza
      infection, acute respiratory infection (ARI; all infections regardless of medical
      intervention), ARI-related hospital admission, COVID-19 related hospital admission,
      pneumonia, mental, physical and social functioning, serious adverse events and adverse
      events, and death.

    <description>Clinically relevant relevant respiratory tract infection is composed of clinical symptoms in combination with the need for medical intervention. Exact criteria for clinically relevant respiratory tract infection and COVID-19 are described in the protocol.
A blinded adjudication committee will determine the status of the primary endpoints of all participants with a potential primary endpoint, based on information provided in a standardized narrative using data reported by the participant and from GP and hospital medical records when relevant. For detection of ARI, symptoms are checked on a weekly (from week 1-4) or bi-weekly basis (from week 4 onward).</description>
