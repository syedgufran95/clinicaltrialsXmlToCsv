  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since emerging in December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has developed into an
      unprecedented global pandemic. The causative pathogen, the severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has the potential to cause a wide range of clinical syndromes,
      from fever, dyspnoea and cough to respiratory failure and cardiac injury necessitating
      critical care support. A number of patients have a more indolent clinical course and can be
      safely managed in the community.

      Characterising the clinical course of Covid-19 infection in the oncology population and
      distinguishing this from other acute oncology presentations which can mimic Covid-19 is a key
      unmet research need. Current standard of care for monitoring patients at high risk of
      chemotherapy associated neutropenic sepsis involves asking them to contact their cancer
      centre when they feel unwell or develop a fever. No standard of care for monitoring
      ambulatory Covid-19 patients has yet been established. We hypothesise that using wearable
      biosensors to detect patients who exhibit 'red flags' for sepsis or deterioration due to
      Covid-19 may allow earlier assessment and intervention. There is no current evidence for
      wearable biosensors in ambulatory patients receiving chemotherapy, and there is no existing
      research into this proposed use of biosensors in patients with suspected or confirmed
      Covid-19 infection.

      In order to justify performing a randomised controlled study comparing standard of care with
      biosensor driven monitoring it is important to establish the tolerability and validity of
      these devices. We aim to collect patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) on tolerability
      and assess the reliability of data transmission to a central data collection server. We will
      also perform an initial analysis of physiological data and correlation with clinical events

      This is a pilot, single arm, open label feasibility study. This is a single centre trial
      based in a large tertiary cancer centre which treats patients across all solid and
      haematological malignancies. Patients will be recruited from all disease groups.

      Patients who present with symptoms suspicious for Covid-19 who the admitting clinicians deems
      appropriate for outpatient management will be considered for this study.

      Patients who are enrolled will undergo continuous physiological monitoring for up to three
      weeks. This includes continuous monitoring of heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature,
      activity levels (by accelerometer measurement) and twice daily pulse oximetry. The
      physiological data will not be reviewed in real time by clinicians and therefore will not be
      used to alter patients' standard care. The pulse oximetry data will be visible to patients
      who will be given clear guidelines to follow with regards to contacting the cancer centre
      hotline should values deviate from baseline.

      In the pilot phase of RECAP 10-30 patients will each be monitored for up to 3 weeks and the
      following endpoints will be addressed:

      Physiological trends and interactions predictive of clinical deterioration due to COVID-19
      (Co-primary endpoint) Reliability of biosensor data collection/transmission using digital
      technology from patients self-isolating at home (Co-primary endpoint) Acceptability and
      tolerability of wearable biosensors and continuous monitoring If the pilot phase is
      successful we will move to a phase II study in a larger number of patients where the
      objective will be to refine a physiological signature predictive of clinical deterioration in
      COVID-19 patients so that early hospitalisation and relevant medical interventions can be
      arranged.

    <ipd_description>The physiological data represents a rich clinical data resource which has the potential to be valuable in other contexts to answer future unanticipated questions. We therefore propose storing this pseudoanonymised data in a Data Bank with a lifespan initially of five years with potential for extension if appropriate ethical approval is gained. This Data Bank could then be used, under ethical approval for other research in order to maximise the potential utility of the data.</ipd_description>
