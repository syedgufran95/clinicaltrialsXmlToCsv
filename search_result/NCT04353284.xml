  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale of the present clinical trial is that an orally available drug given to
      outpatients that could reduce the viral burden in the upper respiratory tract could forestall
      complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection and reduce transmission from one infected individual to
      another.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial to test the
      hypothesis that camostat mesylate, a serine protease inhibitor shown to inhibit SARS-COV-2
      replication in vitro, inhibits SARS-COV-2 replication in early stage, laboratory-confirmed,
      COVID-19 ambulatory patients.

      Camostat mesylate, a serine protease inhibitor used primarily for treating postoperative
      reflux esophagitis and for acute exacerbations of chronic pancreatitis. This drug, with more
      than 15 years clinical experience in Japan with a very safe clinical track record, will be
      studied as a repurposed drug based on published in vitro virus inhibition data and in vivo
      protective effects in a mouse model of SARS.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether camostat mesylate reduces
      SARS-COV-2 viral load in early COVID-19 disease.

    <description>Change of COVID-19 symptom severity from day 0 to day 6 will be assessed with the COVID-19 daily self score tool. Adapted from the FLU-PRO instrument, it consists of 39 items that are answered daily. Items 1-33 are Likert scale questions (rated 0-4) where 0 = not at all and 4 = very much. These items are summed to score the severity of symptoms- where a total score of 132 would indicate the greatest severity of symptoms and a score of 0 would indicate no severity of symptoms. Items 34-38 are also Likert scale questions (rated 0-4) that measure the frequency of specific daily symptoms where 0 = 0 times and 4 = 4 times or more. These items are summed to score the frequency of symptoms- where the highest score for the frequency of symptoms (20) indicates the greatest burden of symptom frequency. The last question (39) asks patients for their highest temperature in Fahrenheit.</description>

             effective contraception with partner.

          -  Agreement to adhere to Lifestyle Considerations (see section 5.3) throughout study
             duration.

        Exclusion Criteria:
