      This expanded access program will provide access to COVID-19 convalescent plasma 150 or more
      individuals with moderate to severe or life-threatening manifestations of COVID-19, or
      documented to be at high risk of developing such manifestations at participating hospitals in
      Colorado.COVID-19 convalescent plasma is the liquid part of blood that is collected from
      patients who have recovered from COVID-19.

      Convalescent plasma collected from individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 contains
      antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Preliminary evidence and data collected during other respiratory
      virus outbreaks (including the 2003 SARS-CoV-1 epidemic, the 2009-2010 H1N1 influenza virus
      pandemic, and the 2012 MERS-CoV epidemic) suggest that the antibodies in convalescent plasma
      may be effective in fighting the infection.

      COVID-19 convalescent plasma will be obtained from FDA registered blood banks and will meet
      all regulatory requirements for conventional plasma and FDA's additional considerations for
      COVID-19 convalescent plasma
      (https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/investigational-new-drug-ind-or-device-exemptio
      n-ide-process-cber/investigational-covid-19-convalescent-plasma-emergency-inds).

      The primary objective of this expanded access program is to provide COVID-19 convalescent
      plasma to patients with moderate to severe or life-threatening manifestations of COVID-19, or
      documented to be at high risk of developing such manifestations.

      The secondary objective will be the evaluation of safety, as assessed by incidents of adverse
      events judged by the treating physician to be potentially related to the administration of
      COVID-19 convalescent plasma.

      Exploratory objectives will include assessments for antibody responses for patients that
      receive convalescent plasma. An exploratory analysis may be conducted correlating the level
      of neutralizing antibody titers with clinical outcomes observed. Due to the need to
      monitoring COVID19 antibody responses following infusion, blood testing at day 1
      post-treatment and at discharge will be obtained as part of enrollment.
