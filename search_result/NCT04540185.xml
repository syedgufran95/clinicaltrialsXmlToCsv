  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early clinical studies showed that besides protecting against poliomyelitis, oral polio
      vaccine (OPV) reduced the number of other viruses that could be isolated from immunized
      children, compared with placebo recipients.

      Both poliovirus and coronavirus are positive-strand RNA viruses; therefore, it is likely that
      they may induce and be affected by common innate immunity mechanisms. Recent reports indicate
      that COVID-19 may result in suppressed innate immune responses. Stimulation by live
      attenuated oral polio vaccines could increase resistance to infection by the causal virus,
      severe acute respiratory syndrome-SARS-CoV-2.

      It has been discovered that SARS-CoV-2 viruses (Covid-19) can directly invade the nervous
      system of patients, instead of injuring the nervous system through the immune response.
      Increasing evidence suggests that infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes neurological deficits in a
      substantial proportion of affected patients. It was observed that patients surviving COVID-19
      are at high risk for subsequent development of neurological disease and in particular
      Alzheimer's disease.

      NA-831 is a new neuroprotective and neurogenesis drug that has been demonstrated its
      promising safety and efficacy in Phase 2A for the treatment of early onset ofAlzheimer's
      disease. NA-831 in oral formulation is well tolerated NA-831 with no adverse effects.

      The Phase 3 clinical trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of OPV with and without
      NA-831 versus placebo.

             amenorrhea for ≥12 consecutive months prior to Screening without an alternative
             medical cause). A follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level may be measured at the
             discretion of the Investigator to confirm postmenopausal status.

          -  Female participants of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study if the
             participant fulfills all the following criteria:

               -  Has a negative pregnancy test at Screening and on the day of the first dose (Day
                  1).

               -  Has practiced adequate contraception or has abstained from all activities that
                  could result in pregnancy for at least 28 days prior to the first dose (Day 1).

             phlebotomy.

          -  Has received or plans to receive a vaccine within 28 days prior to the first dose (Day
             1) or plans to receive a non-study vaccine within 28 days prior to or after any dose
             of investigational product (except for seasonal influenza vaccine).

          -  Has participated in an interventional clinical study within 28 days prior to the day
             of enrollment.

          -  Immunosuppressive or immunodeficient state, including human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV) infection, asplenia, and recurrent severe infections.

          -  Has received systemic immunosuppressants or immune-modifying drugs for &gt;14 days in
             total within 6 months prior to Screening (for corticosteroids ≥20 milligram (mg)/day
             of prednisone equivalent). Topical tacrolimus is allowed if not used within 14 days
             prior to Screening.

          -  Has received systemic immunoglobulins or blood products within 3 months prior to the
             day of Screening.

          -  Has donated ≥450 milliliters (mL) of blood products within 28 days prior to Screening.
