      Abstract

      The pandemic of COVID-19 which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-COV-2) has infected over 20,000,000 people causing over 700,000 deaths .It has no
      currently approved treatments. In this clinical study we confirm that combination of
      isotretinoin and All trans retinoic acid can be used in the treatment of SARS-COV-2 better
      than vaccine according to the findings of previous studies and researches. Retenoic acid can
      induce neutralizing antibodies in case of corona virus (COVID-19) by restoring inhebited and
      exhausted T cells via inhebiting both CD13 and Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). CD13
      amyloid receptor which abundantly overexpressed on cell surface of lymphocyte, Dentritic
      cell, Macrophage, granulocytes and monocytes and is ubiquitous in respiratory tract
      epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, epithelial cells in the kidneys and small
      intestine, activated endothelial cells, and platelets In addition inhibing of
      Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) , Angiotensin T1 protein and Angiotensin II-mediated
      intracellular calcium release pathway which is responsible for COVID-19 cell fusion and
      entry.ACE2-expressing cells are prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection as ACE2 receptor facilitates
      cellular viral entry and replication. A study demonestrated that patients with hypertension
      and diabetes mellitus may be at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as these patients are
      often treated with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs),
      which have been previously suggested to increase ACE2 expression.Butisotretinoin was found to
      be the strongest down-regulator of ACE 2 receptors.and this will give hope for diabetic
      patients or patients with hypertension infected with COVID-19.Therefore we suggest that
      Retinoic Acid will help in inhabiting factors which may enhance antibody dependent
      enhancement (ADE), A phenomenon caused by covid-19 which expected to lead to failure of
      vaccination specially in case of corona virus (covid-19) as a hyper mutatated COVID-19
      antigens can lead to (ADE) phenomenon in which IgG antibodies facilitate viral entry and
      fusion with infected cell through uptake of the virus-IgG complex via the Fc receptors and
      later viral fusion with antigen presenting cells like Dentric cells, macrophages and B cells
      via FcR , through the neonatal FcR instead of antibodies induced viral agglutination and this
      is known as antibody dependent enhancement (ADE)(2) ADE can hamper vaccine development, as a
      vaccine may cause the production of antibodies which, via ADE, worsen the disease the vaccine
      is designed to protect against. ADE in COVID-19 infection can be caused by high mutation rate
      of the gene that encodes spike (S) protein. In this clinical study we suggest that Hyper
      mutated spike protein ,lymphopenia, and impaired dentreic cells all these factors can help in
      and lead to delayed antibodies response and appearing after a period of covid -19 symptoms
      onset and this may be responsible for antibody dependent enhancement (ADE)

      This is a Phase 2, , randomized (1:1:1), placebo-controlled, 2-weeks, proof-of-concept study
      to evaluate the safety and tolerability as well as the mechanistic effect of oral
      administration of potent inhibitor of neutrophil elastase(Inhaled All trans retinoic acid and
      inhaled isotretinoin in subjects infected with COVID -19

      Unfortunately, all of the vaccinated monkeys treated with the Oxford vaccine known as ChAdOx1
      nCoV-19, is undergoing human trials in Britain.became infected when challenged as judged by
      recovery of virus genomic RNA from nasal secretions,&quot; said Dr William Haseltine, a former
      Harvard Medical School professor who had a pivotal role in the development of early HIV/Aids
      treatments. and in general future COVID-19 vaccination which depends on inactivated viral
      vaccine will be restricted to healthy people with strong immunity and It will not be given to
      patients with History of contact with a SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive in nucleic acid test).
      In addition to the COVID-19 viral antigens lead to stimulate antibodies formation of IgM in
      acute phase and IgG type in chronic phase which is facilitate viral entry and fusion with
      infected cell through uptake of the virus-IgG complex via the Fc family of receptors and
      later viral fusion with antigen presenting cells like macrophages, B cells, monocytes via FcR
      family, and vascular endothelium through the neonatal Fc receptor (nFcR) instead of
      antibodies induced viral agglutination and this is known as antibody dependent enhancement
      (ADE)(2).

      There are various hypotheses on how ADE happens and there is a likelihood that more than one
      mechanism exists. In one such pathway, some cells of the immune system lack the usual
      receptors on their surfaces that the virus uses to gain entry, but they have Fc receptors
      that bind to one end of antibodies. The virus binds to the antigen-binding site at the other
      end, and in this way gains entry to and infects the immune cell. Dengue virus can use this
      mechanism to infect human macrophages, if there was a preceding infection with a different
      strain of the virus, causing a normally mild viral infection to become life-threatening.(3)
      An ongoing question in the COVID-19 pandemic is whether-and if so, to what extent-COVID-19
      receives ADE from prior infection with other coronaviruses.

      ADE can hamper vaccine development: ADE can hamper vaccine development, as a vaccine may
      cause the production of antibodies which, via ADE, worsen the disease the vaccine is designed
      to protect against. Vaccine candidates for Dengue virus and feline infectious peritonitis
      virus (a cat coronavirus) had to be stopped because they elicited ADE.(4)

      ADE in coronavirus infection can be caused by high mutation rate of the gene that encodes
      spike (S) protein. A thorough analysis of amino acid variability in SARS-CoV-2 virus
      proteins, that included the S-protein, revealed that least conservative amino acids are in
      most exposed fragments of S-protein including receptor binding domain (RBD).(5) Delayed
      antibodies response and secretion after covid -19 symptoms onset is responsible for antibody
      dependent enhancement (ADE)

      A study shows the first seroconversion day of IgA was 2 days after onset of initial symptoms,
      and the first seroconversion day of IgM and IgG was 5 days after onset. The positive rate of
      antibodies in the 183 samples was 98.9%, 93.4% and 95.1%, for IgA, IgM and IgG, respectively.
      The seroconversion rate for IgA, IgM or IgG was 100% 32 days after symptom onset. According
      to the cumulative seroconversion curve, the median conversion time for IgA, IgM and IgG was
      13, 14 and 14 days, respectively. (6)

      Because this immune response takes a while to show up, antibody tests will be negative for
      those newly infected with COVID-19, which is why they're not used for diagnosis.

      &quot;If it's the beginning of the infection, you don't pick it up, it's something that only
      develops later,&quot; Dr. Melanie Ott, a virologist and immunologist at the Gladstone Institutes
      and a professor at the University of California, San Francisco.(7)

      So, the principal investigator expects that delayed antibody response and delayed
      immunoglobulin class switching are the main reason for antibodies infectivity and
      non-specificity in the highly mutated covid-19 infection

      High-affinity IgG antibodies may efficiently resolve Covid -19 infection

      The more than 100 COVID-19 vaccines in development mainly focus on another immune response:
      antibodies. These proteins are made by B cells and ideally latch onto SARS-CoV-2 and prevent
      it from entering cells. T cells, in contrast, thwart infections in two different ways. Helper
      T cells spur B cells and other immune defenders into action, whereas killer T cells target
      and destroy infected cells. The severity of disease can depend on the strength of these T
      cell responses(1).

      Studies on humoral responses to infections have been mainly geared toward the production of
      high-affinity IgG antibodies that efficiently resolve an infection. It has been well
      recognised, however, that humoral immune response to infection can be a double-edged sword
      that either serves as a protective mechanism to resolve the infection or aggravates the
      tissue injury, e.g. IgG response causes fatal acute lung injury by skewing
      inflammation-resolving response in SARS .(8)

      In the case of respiratory infection, while IgM and IgG isotypes have been the primary
      emphasis in characterising immunity, mucosal and systemic IgA responses that may play a
      critical role in the disease pathogenesis, have received much less attention.(9),(11)

      High neutrophils in covid-19 infection may be the reason of delayed antibody response and
      severe complications

      Humoral immune response, especially production of neutralizing antibody, plays a protective
      role by limiting infection at later phase and prevents reinfection in the future. In
      SARS-CoV, both T and B cell epitopes were extensively mapped for the structural proteins, S,
      N, M and E protein.(12) A limited serology details of SARS-CoV-2 was reported. In a
      preliminary study, one patient showed peak specific IgM at day 9 after disease onset and the
      switching to IgG by week 2.25 Interestingly, sera from 5 patients of confirmed COVID-19 show
      some cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV, but not other coronavirus. Furthermore, all sera from
      patients were able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in an in vitro plaque assay, suggesting a
      possible successful mounting of the humoral responses.(13) Whether the kinetic/titer of
      specific antibody correlates with disease severity remains to be investigated.(14)

      In severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), viral pneumonia progresses to
      respiratory failure. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are extracellular webs of
      chromatin, microbicidal proteins, and oxidant enzymes that are released by neutrophils to
      contain infections. However, when not properly regulated, NETs have potential to propagate
      inflammation and microvascular thrombosis - including in the lungs of patients with acute
      respiratory distress syndrome. While elevated levels of blood neutrophils predict worse
      outcomes in COVID-19, the role of NETs has not been investigated. We now report that sera
      from patients with COVID-19 (n = 50 patients, n = 84 samples) have elevated levels of
      cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase(MPO)-DNA, and citrullinated histone H3 (Cit-H3); the latter
      two are highly specific markers of NETs.(15)

      Neutrophils Are Sophisticated Cells Able to Adapt to Changing Inflammation

      Neutrophils are not simple bags of enzymes sent to kill pathogens before the adaptive immune
      cells move in. In fact, they are able to respond to altered inflammatory status; neutrophils
      can produce cytokines , alter their gene expression during inflammation and throughout
      &quot;aging&quot; and survive for significantly longer than traditionally thought, with one study
      placing lifespan from bone marrow at 5.4 days . As a consequence, neutrophils are able to
      adapt to changing conditions and direct other cells' behaviour-a task which they can perform
      with some sophistication.

      There are a number of murine models in which the T cell responses can be exacerbated by
      depleting neutrophils, implying they have a regulatory role . This suppression of T cell
      responses by neutrophils requires close contact and development of an immunological synapse
      -perhaps as the mediators thought responsible, reactive oxygen species and H2O2 do not
      diffuse far. Uptake of apoptotic or necrotic neutrophils also inhibits DC antigen
      presentation and co-stimulation, resulting in reduced T cell responses-a situation which can
      be exploited by pathogens. For example, neutrophils capture L. major and are subsequently
      engulfed by DCs, suppressing antigen presentation and T cell priming

      NE was also shown to inhibit maturation and function of dendritic cells, including expression
      of the costimulatory molecules CD40, CD80 and CD86 Inflammatory Lung Secretions Inhibit
      Dendritic Cell Maturation and Function via Neutrophil Elastase.(16)

      Inhibitor of elastase in covid-19 infection :

        1. Alvelestat was developed as treatment for lung diseases like Chronic Obstructive
           Pulmonary Disease. Alevelestat works by blocking certain proteins in the body that are
           responsible for inflammation and damage to the lungs that can lead to COPD symptoms.

           Alvelestat Inhibitor of elastase stimulate murine B lymphocyte differentiation into IgG-
           and IgA-producing cells via immunoglobulin class switching and inducing also known as
           isotype switching, isotypic commutation or class-switch recombination (CSR), is a
           biological mechanism that changes a B cell's production of immunoglobulin from one type
           to another, such as from the isotype IgM to the isotype IgG

           A study demonstrated that depletion of neutrophils improves the production of mucosal
           IgA and IgG after sublingual immunization with Bacillus anthracis edema toxin as
           adjuvant. These past studies also demonstrated that an inverse correlation exists
           between the number of neutrophils and production of IgA by B cells. Using specific
           inhibitors of elastase, we addressed whether the elastase activity of neutrophil could
           be the factor that interferes with production of IgA and possibly other immunoglobulin
           isotypes. We found that murine splenocytes and mesenteric lymph node cells cultured for
           5 days in the presence of neutrophil elastase inhibitors secreted higher levels of IgG
           and IgA than cells cultured in the absence of inhibitors and also,This treatment
           however, increased the frequency of CD4+ T cells.(17) As a mucosal targeted virus,
           SARS-CoV-2 would be expected to generate secretory IgA (sIgA) and induce strong mucosal
           immunity. Indeed, the mucosal anti-viral immunity has been shown to result in part from
           the IgA-mediated interactions with the pathogenic microorganisms to prevent pathogens
           from adhering to the cell surface.(17) Upregulated IgA production may be the result of
           increased levels of TGF-β and IL-10 that promote antibody switching in SARS-CoV-2
           infection.(17) A study reported that depletion of neutrophils before systemic injection
           of vaccines increased the magnitude of antigen-specific CD4+ T cell responses, and the
           levels of antigen-specific serum IgG responses .(18)

           Alvelestat and Sivelestat were found to stimulate AID mRNA synthesis. The NE inhibitors
           also induced expression of BAFF, APRIL and IL-10 mRNA in a dose-dependent manner.
           Neutrophil elastase and the related serine proteases cathepsin G and proteinase 3, were
           shown to regulate cytokine responses through activation or degradation of cytokines,
           cytokine receptors, or toll-like receptor .(18) This is consistent with our finding that
           NE inhibitors stimulate IL-10 expression, but also BAFF and APRIL in cultures of
           splenocytes. IL-10 was reported to regulate expression of AID for induction of Ig CSR.
           (19) and it is wellestablished that IL-10 facilitates Ig class switching for production
           of IgA (20). Thus, these data suggest that NE inhibitors stimulate antibody production
           through stimulation of AID and inhibition of the activation/degradation of cytokines and
           cytokine receptors by elastase. NE was also shown to inhibit maturation and function of
           dendritic cells, including expression of the costimulatory molecules CD40, CD80 and CD86
           .(21). Thus, the presence of neutrophil inhibitors may have promoted the maturation of
           dendritic cells and their expression BAFF and APRIL and perhaps costimulatory molecules
           (i.e., CD40) for enhanced antibody production. Although Alvelestat and Sivelestat are
           specific NE inhibitors, one should consider that they might also inhibit related
           elastase-like enzymes. In this regard, activated human B cells were reported to express
           a trypsin-like serine protease on the cell surface .(22) Concluding remarks It was
           previously shown that neutrophil peptide defensins enhance IgG, but not IgA responses
           against nasally co-administered vaccine antigens .(23) Here, the study have shown that
           the serine protease activity of neutrophil elastase, and possibly other serine protease
           such as B cell elastase, also participate in the regulation of B cell biology and
           adaptive immunity. However, unlike neutrophil peptide defensins, NE negatively regulate
           differentiation of B lymphocytes into IgG and IgA secreting cells. The presence of AID
           generally improves antibody-based immunity.(24).

           High Neutrophils in COVID -19 infected patients are capable of causing severe damage to
           the lung tissue by releasing toxic proteases and reactive oxygen species if not
           counterbalanced by the antiproteases.

        2. All-trans retinoic acid (RA) has beneficial effects when used in a variety of
           inflammatory skin conditions. In a study, the authors found that RA inhibited superoxide
           anion production and proteolytic enzyme release by human and rat neutrophils.
           Concomitantly, the authors found that RA-treated neutrophils were less able than
           untreated neutrophils to injure endothelial cells in culture even though the adhesion of
           the RA-treated neutrophils to endothelial cell monolayers was not diminished. Inhibition
           of cytotoxicity occurred over the same range of concentrations that inhibited oxygen
           radical formation and protease release. In additional studies, it was observed that
           pretreatment of endothelial cells with RA-induced resistance to subsequent injury by
           activated neutrophils. Finally, in vivo studies showed that pretreatment of rats for 3
           days with RA (1-10 mg/day, IP) reduced the degree of injury in the lungs and skin sites
           after treatment with bovine serum albumin and antibodies to bovine serum albumin in the
           reverse-passive Arthus reaction. Thus, RA can modulate neutrophil-mediated endothelial
           cell injury by an effect on both the neutrophils and their target cells. Together, these
           effects may underlie the reduction in immune complex-mediated injury seen in
           experimental animals. The beneficial effects that retinoids have in a variety of
           inflammatory skin diseases may likewise be a reflection of their effects on the
           physiology of both neutrophils and endothelial cells.

      Oral retinyl palmitate or retinoic acid corrects mucosal IgA responses toward an intranasal
      influenza virus vaccine in vitamin a deficient mice. Retinoids inhibit inflammatory TH17 T
      cell responses, promote regulatory T cell (Treg) responses, and regulate expression of
      toll-like receptors (TLRs) .(57)

      So, the principal investigator expects that retinoic acid will be effective in covid -19
      patients better than the other neutrophil elastase inhibitor like Alvelestat because Attia et
      al (2018) demonstrated that Sivelestat reduced secretion of IgM in a dose-dependent manner ,
      IgM type of antibodies which is very important in viral neutralization and on the other hand
      retinoic acid stops neutrophil-mediated endothelial cell injury by an effect on both the
      neutrophils and their target cells.

      Seconed drug is Isotretinoin(13cis RA) and ATRA may be able to inhibit COVID 2019 infection
      via inducing the antiviral immunity and this is discussed as follow :

      A study demonstrated that 13 cis retinoic is used in treating Emphysema (emphysema is a lung
      condition that causes shortness of breath), Since an effective immune response against viral
      infections depends on the activation of cytotoxic T cells that can clear infection by killing
      virus-infected cells , boosting the numbers and function of T cells in COVID-19 patients is
      critical for successful recovery. A recent study reported that the 82.1% of COVID-19 cases
      displayed low circulating lymphocyte counts. A CoV infects macrophages, and then macrophages
      present CoV antigens to T cells. This process leads to T cell activation and differentiation,
      including the production of cytokines associated with the different T cell subsets (Th17),
      followed by a massive release of cytokines for immune response amplification. The continued
      production of these mediators due to viral persistence has a negative effect on NK, and CD8 T
      cell activation.(25)

      Recent study of 522 COVID patients and 40 healthy controls from two hospitals in Wuhan, China
      demonstrated that T cell numbers are negatively correlated to serum IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α
      concentration, with patients in decline period showing reduced IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α
      concentrations and restored T cell counts. T cells from COVID-19 patients have significantly
      higher levels of the exhausted marker programmed cell death protein(PD-1) as compared to
      health controls. Moreover, increasing PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on T cells could be seen as
      patients progressed from prodromal to overtly symptomatic stages, further indicative of T
      cell exhaustion. T cell exhaustion is a progressive loss of effector function due to
      prolonged antigen stimulation, characteristic of chronic infections. Dendritic cell
      inhibition is connected to exhaustion of CD8+ T cell polyfunctionality during chronic
      hepatitis C virus infection. CD8 T cells produce very effective mediators to clear
      nCoV2019.(26)

      Dendritic cells (DCs) play a key role in innate immune and adaptive immune responses. As the
      strongest antigen presenting cells in the organism, they effectively stimulate the activation
      of T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes, thus combining innate and adaptive immunity. Immature DCs
      have strong migration ability, and mature DCs can effectively activate T cells in the central
      link of startup, regulation, and maintenance of immune responses. Thus, once the maturation
      process of DCs is blocked, it directly affects the initiation of subsequent adaptive immune
      response. MERS-CoV-2 is able to affect human dendritic cells and macrophages in-vitro
      .Productive replication of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in monocyte-derived
      dendritic cells modulates innate immune response.(27)

      Another study proposed that C -C chemokine receptor type 4 (CCR4) contributes to T cell lung
      homing imprinting. It was found that lung DCs induce the expression of CCR4 on T cells. Lung
      DCs-activated T cells traffic more efficiently into the lung and protect against influenza
      more effectively compared with T cells activated by DCs from other tissues. Lim and
      colleagues suggested that CXCR4 plays a role in CD8+ T cell migration to airway tissues.(28)

      Dendritic cell inhibition is connected to exhaustion of CD8+ T cell polyfunctionality during
      chronic hepatitis C virus infection. CD8 T cells produce very effective mediators to clear
      nCoV2019.(29)

      Presence of RA in different tissues is very imprtant for immune induction and fighting viral
      infection, for example, RA is present at high concentrations in the small intestine due to
      metabolizing dietary vitamin A by gut epithelial cells. In this local environment, RA
      activate and primes dendritic cells (DCs) to become CD103+ DCs that produce RA.3, 4CD103+ DCs
      are migratory cells that activate naive T cells in mesenteric lymph nodes to become effector
      T cells that contribute to both intestinal homeostasis and immunity.and also RA is an
      important signal that induces IgA-producing B cells. The gut homing T cells and B cells play
      essential roles in protecting the digestive tract from pathogens.(30) Retinoic acid (atRA)
      can inhibit the spontaneous apoptosis of activated human T lymphocytes in vitro. 13-cis RA
      activates Th2 cytokine production Enhanced circulating dendritic cell numbers.(40)

      So, according to this previous studies the principal investigator suggests that T cells
      lymphopenia and exhaustion may be resulted by Dendritic cells (DCs) infection and inhibition
      by MERS-CoV-2.

      Retinoic acid has profound effects on cellular proliferation and differentiation. Moreover,
      it has been reported that ATRA exhibits both anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects.
      Recent studies have shown that FOXP3 expression and the immune function of Regulatory T cells
      (Tregs ) can be enhanced by ATRA in the immune system of both patients and mic.13Retinoic
      acid (RA) is produced by a number of cell types, including macrophages and dendritic cells,
      which express retinal dehydrogenases that convert vitamin A to its main biologically active
      metabolite, all-trans RA. All-trans RA binds to its nuclear retinoic acid receptors that are
      expressed in lymphoid cells and act as transcription factors to regulate cell homing and
      differentiation. RA production by CD103+ dendritic cells and alveolar macrophages functions
      with TGF-b to promote conversion of naive T cells into Foxp3+ regulatory T cells and,
      thereby, maintain mucosal tolerance.(50) So, principal investigator expects high inducing of
      Dendritic cells (DCs) by retinoic acid treatment which will lead to T cells activation and
      migration with less exhaustion phenomenon.

      Researchers from Wenzhou, China looked at clinical laboratory features including lipid levels
      of patients with COVID 19. They found dramatic reductions in the cholesterol levels of
      patients infected with COVID 19, compared with healthy controls .The study provides data to
      suggest that cholesterol levels decline quite rapidly during the early stages of infection
      and increase as the patient starts to recover. Therefore, indicating that cholesterol may
      have an important role to play in defending the body against such infections According to our
      protocol depending on previous studies the principal investigator demonstrated that there is
      a strong relation between immune system and cholesterol levels . :-

      Cellular cholesterol is a component of the plasma membrane and is also essential in cell
      proliferation. Regulation of intracellular cholesterol levels has been proposed as a
      mechanism to regulate T cell and macrophages proliferation. Intracellular cholesterol level
      is regulated by two competing pathways, cholesterol uptake and efflux, and ABCA1 plays a
      major role in the cholesterol efflux pathway. The ATRA induces ABCA1 expression and
      ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux in activated primary human CD4+ T cells implying that RA
      could affect T cell functions by regulating the cellular cholesterol levels.(51) ATRA
      upregulates ABCA1 expression only in activated CD4+ T cells, indicating that induction of
      ABCA1 by ATRA and 13 cis Retinoic Acid may play an important role in immune response.

      Retinoic acid and liver X receptor agonist synergistically inhibit HIV infection in CD4+ T
      cells by up-regulating ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux.(52)(53)

      RA also acts directly on macrophages at both mucosal sites and other immunological sites.
      AtRA modulates peritoneal macrophage activation by endotoxin and IFN-γ by suppressing TNF
      production and nitric oxide (NO) synthesis .In addition, at RA inhibits the expression of
      PGE2 and COX-2 and the release of TNF, which are induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide
      (LPS) in murine peritoneal macrophages .(54)

      A study reported recently that substance (ATRA) have preventive effects on pulmonary fibrosis
      by inhibiting IL-6-dependent proliferation and TGF-β1-dependent trans differentiation of lung
      fibroblasts. Also, another studies demonstrated that 13-cis-retinoic acid and other retinoid
      analogs inhibit IL-1-induced IL-6 production and that this effect is analog-specific and, at
      least partially, transcriptionally mediated. This effect was dose-dependent with an IC50 of
      10(-7) M RA and significant inhibition being noted with doses of RA as low as 10(-8) M. IL-10
      production was inhibited by ATRA administration.(55)

      A study demonstrated that TLR3(-/-), TLR4(-/-), and TRAM(-/-) mice are more susceptible to
      SARS-CoV than wild-type mice but experience only transient weight loss with no mortality in
      response to infection. In contrast, mice deficient in the TLR3/TLR4 adaptor TRIF are highly
      susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, showing increased weight loss, mortality, reduced lung
      function, increased lung pathology, and higher viral titers . New studies showed that the
      high level of IFN-α/β produced from the TLR3-IRF3/IRF7 pathway and IFN-β is the reason for
      inhibiting DENV replication. 13Cis retinoic Acid induced significant upregulation of
      toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) resulting in an immune response to dsRNA intermediate which can
      be partially generated during CoV-2 replicationTLR3 sensitized by dsRNA and cascades of
      signaling pathways (IRFs and NFκB activation, respectively) are activated to produce type I
      IFNs.(56)

      .

      Oral retinyl palmitate or retinoic acid corrects mucosal IgA responses toward an intranasal
      influenza virus vaccine in vitamin a deficient mice. Retinoids inhibit inflammatory TH17 T
      cell responses, promote regulatory T cell (Treg) responses, and regulate expression of
      toll-like receptors (TLRs) .(57) In vitro treatment of normal human monocytes with all-trans
      retinoic acid (ATRA) down-regulates TLR-2 expression (58), but this effect has not been
      examined in patients treated with systemic retinoids. Isotretinoin (13-cis retinoic acid;
      13-cis RA) is the only drug capable of inducing a long-term or permanent remission of acne;
      however, the mechanisms leading to this durable response are unknown. Given the role of TLR-2
      in initiating immune responses to P. acnes, we hypothesized that down-regulation of TLR-2 on
      monocytes and/or the induction of Treg responses in vivo may represent mechanisms by which
      isotretinoin exerts its long-term effects.

      Isotretinoin(13cis RA) may be able to inhibit COVID 2019 entry via down regulation of ACE2 ,
      AT1 protein and Ang II-mediated intracellular calcium release rather than inhibition of
      interleukin-6 (IL-6) and this is discussed as follow :

      Many authors misunderstands the difference between ARBs, which block ATR1 receptors and the
      hypothesised drug that could block the COVID-19 binding site on ACE2 receptor, which is
      totally different from ATR1 and 2.

      The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-COV-2 has infected over 2,000,000 people causing over
      150,000 deaths.(59) A key host cellular protein required for the virus entry is
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) whose expression has been demonstrated in many tissues
      including alveolar epithelial type II cells in lungs, oral mucosa and intestine, heart,
      kidney, endothelium and skin. ACE2-expressing cells can act as home cells and are prone to
      SARS-CoV-2 infection as ACE2 receptor facilitates cellular viral entry and replication.(60) A
      study demonestrated that patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus may be at higher
      risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as these patients are often treated with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs)
      or angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs), which have been previously suggested to
      increase ACE2 expression.(61) In another study by Sinha et al who analyzed a publicly
      available Connectivity Map (CMAP) dataset of pre/post transcriptomic profiles for drug
      treatment in cell lines for over 20,000 small molecules, isotretinoin was the strongest
      down-regulator of ACE 2 receptors. On the other hand, they found 6 drugs in CMAP that are
      currently being investigated in clinical trials for treating COVID-19 (chloroquine,
      thalidomide, methylprednisolone, losartan, lopinavir and ritonavir, from clinicaltrials.gov),
      none of which was found to significantly alter ACE2 expression (P&gt;0.1) Moreover, another
      study demonstrated that isotretinoin is a Potential papain like protease (PLpro) inhibitors
      which is a protein encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes and considered one of the proteins that should
      be targeted in COVID-19 treatment by performing target-based virtual ligand screening.As
      Principal Investigator discussed before that (13cRA) is the strongest down-regulator of ACE2.

      The principal investigator expects that 13cRA can inhibit or dowenrgulat ACE2 by direc
      interaction and binding with the transmembrane ACE2, Suggesting its therapeutic potential in
      preventing the entry of COVID 2019 to the host cell.

      Previous studies on the related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and
      SARS-CoV FP FP have shown that calcium (Ca2+) plays an important role for fusogenic activity
      via a Ca2+ binding pocket with conserved glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D)
      residuesdemonstrated that intracellular Ca2+ enhances MERS-CoV WT PPs infection by
      approximately two-fold and that E891 is a crucial residue for Ca2+interaction. Electron spin
      resonance revealed that this enhancement could be attributed to Ca2+ increasing MERS-CoV FP
      fusion-relevant membrane ordering. Intriguingly, isothermal calorimetry titration showed that
      MERS-CoV FP binds one Ca2+, as opposed to SARS-CoV FP which binds to two Ca2+ ion.(62)

      Angiotensin II increases the intracellular calcium activity in podocytes of the intact
      glomerulus. The L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nicardipine did not influence the Ang II-mediated
      [Ca2+] increase and it has been postulated that SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 may attenuate
      residual ACE2 activity, skewing the ACE/ACE2 balance to a state of heightened angiotensin II
      activity leading to pulmonary vasoconstriction and inflammatory and oxidative organ damage,
      which increases the risk for acute lung injury (ALI). AngII via AT1 receptors upregulates
      many proinflammatory genes, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular
      adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6).30 but 13cis RA specifically
      down-regulated the AT1 protein in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Down-regulation of the
      AT1 expression leads to reduced AngII-mediated intracellular calcium release Similarly with
      receptor down-regulation, Treatment with 13cRA resulted in a significant reduction in AT1
      mRNA .(63)

      Finally, the principal investigator expects that Isotretinoin will help in antibody induction
      against COVID-19 via inducing different types of antiviral immune factors and also,
      decreasing of COVID -19 hyper mutation by blocking its ACE2 receptors and preventing the
      virus from cell entry and replication and this will give the immune system time to recognize
      COVID -19.
