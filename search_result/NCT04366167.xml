      This study will describe and explore the recovery process of patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery during the covid-19 pandemic. This will include mortality, morbidity, health-related
      quality of life, event-specific distress and depression.

      The overall aim of this study is to describe and explore the recovery process of patients
      undergoing cardiac surgery during the covid-19 pandemic. This will include mortality,
      morbidity, health-related quality of life, event-specific distress and depression.

      All adult patients having cardiac surgery during the pandemic at St Bartholomew's Hospital
      will be approached to join this study. As of the end of March this is this is approximately
      20 operations a week. Questionnaires will be administered at five time points alongside a
      review of clinical notes.

      Appropriate descriptive and summative statistics will be used to analyse outcomes. If sample
      size is adequate, possible associations/effect of the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on each
      of the recovery parameters included in the study will be determined. The differences in
      outcomes between those with and without covid-19 may also be analysed if the sample size is
      adequate. Bias and loss to follow-up in observational cohort studies has been considered.

    <description>The revised Impact of Events revised version (IES-R) questionnaire (Weiss and Marmar, 1997) is widely used as a measure of event-specific distress and measures distress experienced by serious life changes/events. It has been commonly used to assess persons with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is an 22 item self-report scale where is item is reported on a five point likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely) with respect to how distressing each item has been during the past week. Scale scores are formed for the three subscales, which reflect intrusion (8 items: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 14, 16, 20), avoidance (8 items: 5,7,8,11,12,13,17,22), and hyperarousal (6 items: 4,10,15.18.19.21). A cut-off of 26 and above has been suggested for a clinically significant reaction to a psychological trauma, although the IES alone does not diagnose PTSD or reflect a person's ability to function.

    <description>Health-related quality of life will be measured using the EQ5D-5L questionnaire. The EQ5D is a standardised, simple generic measure of health well, which is received by patients (Kim et al., 2005). It consists of five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each with five levels of health response and a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0-100 (0 being the worst possible health imaginable and 100 being the best possible health imaginable).

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week after discharge, 6 weeks (+/- 2 weeks) post surgery, 6 months (+/- 2 weeks) post surgery, 1 year (+/- 2 weeks) post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Depression will be measured using the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The CES-D is a 20-item self-report adult instrument designed to measure common symptoms of depression that have occurred over the past week, such as poor appetite, hopelessness, pessimism, and fatigue. All questions are answered on a scale of 0-3, with 0 indicating no symptom presence and with 3 representing symptoms &quot;most or all of the time.&quot; CES-D scores range from 0 to 60 with higher scores indicating more severe depressive symptoms. A score of 16 or higher identifies subjects with clinically meaningful depression. Metric for summarising data: t-test</description>
