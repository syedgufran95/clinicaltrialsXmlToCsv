          -  Male or female, 12 years of age or older.

          -  Clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 and/or locally accepted positive test; if feasible,
             swab should be taken and saved for quantitative testing to determine viral load.

          -  Disease severity making the patient eligible for hospitalization (whether or not
             hospitalization is available), with evidence of cytokine storm as determined by the
             treating physician. Manifestations of cytokine storm can include the following:

          -  Severe shortness of breath (respiratory rate &gt; 24 breaths/minute).

          -  SpO2 of &lt; 90% on ambient air.

          -  Need for invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation.

          -  Acute respiratory distress syndrome.

          -  Multiple organ failure.

          -  Be willing to avoid pregnancy or fathering children

          -  Able to provide written informed consent, consent from the patient's legally

          -  Patients with inadequate liver function (ALT above 4 × ULN or direct bilirubin 4 × ULN
             and the laboratory abnormalities are considered to be due to underlying liver
             dysfunction).

          -  Patients with platelet counts &lt; 50 × 109 /L

          -  Any underlying or current medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the
             treating physician, would place the patient at an unacceptable risk if he or she were

          -  Previous allergic reactions to JAK inhibitors or excipients.

          -  Concomitant use of any other JAK inhibitor.

          -  Is eligible or able to access ruxolitinib through an Incyte-sponsored clinical study
             or is eligible for another therapeutic clinical trial for cytokine storm at the
             treating institution..
