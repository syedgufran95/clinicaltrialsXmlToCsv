      This is a Multi-Centric, Open label, Two Arm Randomized, Pivotal Phase 2 Study.

      All eligible patients entering into the study will be randomized in 2:1 ratio to receive the
      treatment A (Best supportive care + Itolizumab) / B (Best supportive care) respectively. Each
      patient will undergo the treatment based on their assigned treatment for a month along with
      battery of tests that includes, but not limited to, cytokines and chemokine, along with daily
      recording of TLC; DLC, ANC, ALC; Platelet count; S. creatinine; T.Bilirubin; morning Vitals
      -pulse, BP, RR; Temperature (highest temperature of the day), PaO2/FiO2, MAP, GCS.

      As Itolizumab is an investigational drug, the benefit to COVID-19 patients experiencing
      complications such as Cytokine Release Syndrome is not known. However, findings from this
      study may be beneficial to the society at a large at the National and International Level.
