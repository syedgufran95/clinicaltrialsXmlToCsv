  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthcare Workers (HCW) are at high risk for COVID-19. In addition to the risk of serious
      forms among HCW, significant absenteeism due to illness would have dramatic consequences in
      our ability to fight COVID-19. No coronavirus vaccine is available today and drug treatments
      are only at the start of clinical evaluation. Available since 1921, the bacillus Calmette and
      Guérin (BCG) is the most widely used vaccine in the world (&gt; 3 billion doses administered)
      with an extremely low rate of adverse effects. BCG is indicated for the prevention of
      tuberculosis (TB), but more recent studies have shown that it also has nonspecific immune
      properties which may be interesting in the current COVID-19 epidemic. Data in mice and in
      humans have demonstrated protection conferred by BCG against viral respiratory infections
      such as influenza. In countries with high endemic TB, BCG decreases the incidence of acute
      respiratory infections by up to 80%, neonatal BCG vaccination has been shown to greatly
      reduce the risk of sepsis and of hospitalization of children for reasons other than TB. A
      recent study conducted in South Africa showed that re-vaccination with BCG in adults reduced
      the incidence of respiratory infections by 70% compared to unvaccinated controls. Beyond
      respiratory infections, BCG has also shown protective effects against inflammatory diseases.
      These non-specific beneficial effects are likely linked to the induction of &quot;trained innate
      immunity&quot;, implying epigenetic and metabolic re-programming of innate immune cells. It is
      therefore possible that revaccination with BCG could significantly reduce the incidence and
      severity of COVID-19. Very recent ecological observations indeed suggest an inverse
      correlation between BCG vaccination coverage and the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. In
      this context several trials began in Europe and Australia to evaluate the efficacy of BCG
      vaccination in populations at risk of exposure (HCW) or severe disease (elderly). This study
      is aligned with studies carried out in Australia, The Netherlands and Spain. In contrast to
      these latter studies, virtually all French study participants have been vaccinated in their
      childhood, since BCG vaccination was mandatory in France in neonates until 2007, and in HCW
      until recently. Therefore, the French study will be in a unique situation to evaluate the
      effect of re-vaccination with BCG in the context of BCG priming decades before revaccination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, multicenter phase III controlled trial, in 2 parallel arms:

        -  One group vaccinated with BCG

        -  One group receiving placebo (0.9 % saline) Randomization in a 1: 1 ratio will be
           stratified on the center. The study will be proposed to all heath care workers eligible.
           At screening, the investigator will propose the study to the participant and explain the
           details by providing an information letter. After signature of the consent, evaluations
           specific for the study will be undertaken, such as clinical examination, blood sampling,
           nasopharyngeal sampling in case of clinical signs.

      At the inclusion visit, participants corresponding to the inclusion criteria will be
      randomized to receive BCG or placebo.

      Participants will receive a single dose of BCG vaccine (or placebo). The adult dose of BCG
      vaccine (or placebo) is 0.1 mL injected intradermally over the distal insertion of the
      deltoid muscle onto the humerus (approximately one third down the upper arm).

      Follow-up visits will be done respectively at M3 and M6 and phone contacts between these two
      visits.

      Blood samples will be collected prior to randomization (V0) and at 3 and 6 months to
      determine exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Where
      required, swab/blood samples will be taken at illness episodes to assess SARS-CoV-2
      infection.

      Participants will be followed for 6 months with regular mobile phone text messages 2 times
      weekly to collect local and general reactions until 30 days after vaccination and during the
      study to identify and detail COVID-19 infection.

      Immunological studies will be conducted at a central Laboratory. Analysis will take place
      after M6 visits.

      A nested study will be carried out on blood samples of 72 study subjects in order to evaluate
      the impact of COVID-19 on innate immunity. These blood samples will be collected at M6 among
      6 groups, each containing 12 study subjects:

        -  One group of subjects vaccinated with BCG that have remained sero-negative for SARS CoV2

        -  One group of subjects having received placebo that have remained sero-negative for SARS
           CoV2

        -  One group of symptomatic subjects vaccinated with BCG

        -  One group of symptomatic subjects having received placebo.

        -  One group without symptoms but sero-positive for SARS CoV2 vaccinated with BCG

        -  One group without symptoms but sero-positive for SARS CoV2 vaccinated with placebo
