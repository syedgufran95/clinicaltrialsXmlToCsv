  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 pandemic has an important impact on the health care provided by the
      anesthesiologists. Different societies of anesthesiology have provided guidelines and
      recommendations on how to manage patients who have been tested positive for COVID-19 or
      suspected to be infected. It is therefore important to know whether these guidelines have
      been implemented or were possible to be implemented. Otherwise patients who are presenting
      COVID-19 often show pulmonary complications. The airway management and the ventilation
      management of these patients can be therefore challenging and can possibly influence their
      outcome. It is thus important to obtain a large database with information about the
      characteristics of these patients, how these patients have been managed and their in-hospital
      outcome. Information regarding the correct implementation of guidelines is as well necessary
      for future guidance of health care providers.
