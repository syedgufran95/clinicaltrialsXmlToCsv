  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this first-in-humans dose escalation study, AZD7442 (AZD8895 + AZD1061) will be evaluated
      for safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and generation of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs).
      The study is intended to enable future studies of AZD7442's efficacy in preventing and
      treating COVID-19.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, first time in human, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and
      dose escalation study.

      The study will comprise of:

        1. A Screening Period of up to 27 days (Day -28 through Day -2);

        2. A Treatment Period during which participants will be resident at the Clinical Unit from
           Day -1, 1 day before Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) administration (on Day 1)
           until at least 24 hours after IMP administration, will be discharged on Day 2 after all
           safety evaluations have been completed, and

        3. A Follow up Period lasting 360 days (through to Day 361) after the IMP dose.

      The study will be conducted at a single study centre in United Kingdom.
