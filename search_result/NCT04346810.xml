  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intense health crisis due to COVID-19 led to a profound reorganization of the activities
      at theatres, recovery rooms and the intensive care units. The caregivers are facing several
      issues and are daily exposed to an intensification of the work. Assessing the stress and the
      well-being of the caregivers is very important in this context.

      The current period of intense and prolonged health crisis has necessitated a profound
      reorganization of the activities and organizations of the intensive care hospital services in
      order to be able to cope with it.

      Caregivers are at the heart of the management of this crisis and are exposed daily to these
      situations of repeated emergencies, an intensification of the pace of work and difficulties
      in care.

      In this context, it seemed important to us to try to quantify this pressure of care, in order
      to be able to offer in second care adapted to caregivers who would like it.

      The assessment of the mental state of the caregivers as well as the collection of the
      feelings and perceptions on the current crisis and its management will be carried out by
      anonymous and voluntary self-questionnaire in collaboration with the service of professional
      pathologies and occupational medicine of the hospital structure
