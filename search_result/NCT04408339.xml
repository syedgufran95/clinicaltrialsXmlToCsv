      The COVIDHELP study will prospectively evaluate the yet unknown clinical course of the
      COVID-19 infection in cancer patients and document the impact of potential infrastructural
      limitations on cancer care of COVID-19 positive patients. All patients consenting will
      provide peripheral blood samples for prospective biobanking with the aim of investigating
      immune response and immunity against COVID-19.

      Based on patients, who are treated in the University Cancer Center Hamburg (UCCH) and its
      contracted partner network, which comprises all cancer treating departments at the University
      Medical Center of Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE), as well as 19 office-based oncologists and 20
      surrounding hospitals, recruitment for the study will be done as follows:

      (i) as a cancer patient during regular aftercare appointments who reports a current or past
      COVID-19 infection.

      (ii) as an acute COVID-19 patient who reports a prevalent cancer diagnosis

      Data will be collected as available from routine clinical care and includes demographic and
      biometric data, medical history, baseline data at inclusion as well as inpatient and
      intensive care unit admissions. Upon consent, patients will provide peripheral blood samples
      at time of inclusion and after 6 month. Recruitment is limited to a one-year period (April
      2020 - April 2021).
