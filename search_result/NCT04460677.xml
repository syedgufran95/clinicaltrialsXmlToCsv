  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of
      a brief, telehealth intervention (the Emotional Support Plan), intended to support autistic
      adults to cope with their negative emotions during and/or after the COVID-19 pandemic. The
      first objective is to develop and refine a brief telehealth-delivered treatment, the
      Emotional Support Plan (ESP), to help promote adults to cope during periods of acute
      distress, such as those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The second objective is to
      assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the ESP to support autistic adults to implement
      emotion regulation strategies during periods of acute distress. The last objective is to
      yield preliminary data to apply for extramural grants to validate these methods to monitor
      and support mental health of autistic adults during key transitions (e.g., starting college).

    <measure>Decreased distress on Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 week study period</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9, assessed weekly, is a 9-item questionnaire of psychological function over the past week with all items on a &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day) scale. Higher scores equal more distress.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Decreased distress on EMA reports</measure>
    <time_frame>8 week study period</time_frame>
    <description>EMA (Ecological Momentary Assessment) reports of decreased distress (in ESP + daily monitoring group only). Higher scores on the item equal higher levels of distress.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Decreased anxiety symptoms on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 week study period</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7, assessed weekly, is a 7-item questionnaire of anxiety symptoms over the past week with all items on a &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day) scale. Higher scores equal more anxiety.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adult Self Report (ASR)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 week study period</time_frame>
    <description>The ASR is a measure of adaptive functioning and psychopathology (e.g., anxiety, depression symptoms). Most of the items are on a 3 point scale including: (0) Not true, (1) Somewhat or sometimes true, and (2) Very often or often true.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria Adults 18 years or older with previously established diagnoses in ASD
        will be invited to participate. Adults who have a verbal IQ above 70 or who are students
        admitted to a college or university will be included in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Individuals who are younger than 18 years old or who does not have diagnosis of ASD
             will excluded from the study as the purpose of the current research is to evaluate the
             validity of ESPs in adults with autism.

          -  Adults who are unable to understand English will be excluded because the instruments
             being investigated are currently only validated in English and the study team is not
             sufficiently fluent in other languages to provide assurance that informed consent
             could be obtained (or intervention provided) in a language besides English.

          -  Subjects without access to a compatible iOS and Android smartphone (nearly all phones
             from the past 10 years are compatible) will be excluded because the study requires
             subjects to record responses on a smartphone app. Individuals will not be excluded
             from the study based on race, ethnicity or gender.

          -  Subjects who have a verbal IQ below 70 will be excluded as this is a study that
             requires self-report and engagement in a one-on-one intervention.

          -  If the PI's clinical judgment is that it would not be in the adult's best interest to
             be enrolled, they may also be excluded.
