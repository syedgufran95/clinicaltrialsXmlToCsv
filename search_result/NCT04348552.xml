  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 epidemic is causing a global health crisis. In France, it has imposed a major
      reorganization of the healthcare system. This emergency reorganization is unprecedented. It
      involved first, second and third line care. Following this reorganization and from the first
      days of confinement, a decrease in care activity not related to COVID-19 was observed in
      médical offices, in emergency services, and in secondary and tertiary care services. This
      decrease in activity could indicate a decrease in pathologies related to work, transportation
      or non-COVID-19 infections, due to a favourable effect of lockdown. Nevertheless, some health
      professionals report the opposite in the media and on social networks, an unusual increase in
      events (appendicular peritonitis treated late, increase in domestic violence, etc.), while
      others are surprised by a decrease in activity that is difficult to explain (leukaemia
      diagnoses by biologists, for example). One hypothesis is that such changes could be related
      to the reorganisation of the health care system or to the consequences of lockdown.

      The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a systematic collection and analysis of
      patient safety incidents (also called &quot;adverse events&quot; in France). The objective is to assess
      the roles of the system and human factors in patient safety, in order to propose changes to
      the global system and local organisation. In France, there is a system for reporting serious
      adverse events related to care. Only 4% of the 820 serious adverse events reported in 2018
      were reported by primary healthcare professionals (1). However, patient safety incidents in
      primary care are known to have specific mechanisms, types and mechanisms (2).

      We hypothesize that the COVID-19 health crisis may have induced unusual patient safety
      incidents through new mechanisms in a context associating reorganization of the healthcare
      system and population lockdown. Such a scenario requires the implementation of a massive
      collection of potential incidents and their systematic and well-structured analysis.

      Thus, the objective of our study is to describe patient safety incidents related to the
      reorganization of care and/or lockdown in the context of the COVID-19 health crisis (types,
      severity, mechanisms) reported by primary care professionals in France.
