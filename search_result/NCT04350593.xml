    <textblock>
      This is an international, multicenter, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, placebo
      controlled, study in hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 in the US and other countries
      with high prevalence of COVID-19. The study is evaluating the effect of dapagliflozin 10 mg
      versus placebo, given once daily for 30 days in addition to background local standard of care
      therapy, in reducing disease progression, complications, and all-cause mortality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent information on patients at risk for developing serious complications, including death,
      in the setting of COVID-19, indicate that those with cardiometabolic disease (hypertension,
      type 2 diabetes, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and/or kidney disease
      at baseline) are at much greater risk. Moreover, a large proportion of these patients develop
      cardiovascular and/or kidney complications. SGLT2i have previously been demonstrated to have
      potent heart and kidney-protective effects in patients with type 2 diabetes, heart failure
      and/or chronic kidney disease, and may afford protection of these vital organ systems in the
      setting of COVID-19.

      Furthermore, both pre-clinical and clinical studies suggest that SGLT2i may favorably impact
      the underlying mechanistic processes dysregulated in the setting of acute major illness (such
      as COVID-19) and include favorable effects on endothelial function, inflammation, oxidative
      stress, tissue hypoxia, energy metabolism and autophagy. These mechanisms have been shown to
      be important in the setting of respiratory failure, sepsis and multi-organ failure/cytokine
      storm.

      The study population will include hospitalized patients with mild-moderate manifestations of
      COVID-19 of any duration, but without the need for mechanical ventilation at the time of
      screening. The eligible patients should have risk-factors for developing serious
      complications of COVID-19.

      It will include patients with a history of at least one of the following: hypertension, T2DM,
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, HF and/or CKD stage 3 to 4 (eGFR ≥25 mL/min/1.73m2).

      Patients will be treated for 30 days, with either dapagliflozin 10 mg daily or placebo, each
      to be given in addition to the usual standard of care in the participating hospital. Patients
      will be followed up for an extended additional (observational) period of 60 days (total
      duration of follow up 90 days) after completing the treatment period.

      The study assessments include only those that are absolutely critical for ensuring the safety
      of the patients, to measure efficacy outcomes, and collect biomarker data, so as not to place
      too high a burden on the study personnel and to minimize additional risk of exposure to SARS
      CoV-2.

      The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is time to first event of all-cause death or
      morbid disease complications (respiratory, cardiovascular and kidney) through 30 days of
      follow-up.

      The safety data will be monitored by an Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee.
