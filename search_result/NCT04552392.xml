  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quarantine separates persons who have been potentially exposed to an infectious agent (and
      thus at risk for disease) from the general community. However, it may create psychological,
      emotional, and financial problems for some persons. The experience of those placed under
      quarantine in terms of compliance, difficulties, emotional response and psychological impact
      remains under-researched. In view of the increasing cases of COVID-19 in India and the rising
      numbers of people being quarantined as a precautionary measure, it was imperative to assess
      those quarantined for the psychological impact of the concerns regarding this illness and the
      quarantine procedure. In India, no such study had been undertaken and our study thus filled
      the research gap. The cross-sectional observational study aims at assessing the psychological
      impact of quarantine on Indian BSF jawans (n=100). They would be assessed for depression,
      anxiety, perceived stress level of impact, and impact of life events using Beck Depression
      Inventory, State Trait Anxiety Inventory, Perceived Stress Scale, and Impact of Events
      Scale-Revised. A qualitative interview schedule will also be carried out. Data would be
      analysed.

      The cross-sectional observational study is aimed at assessing the psychological impact of
      quarantine on Indian Border Security Force (BSF) soldiers (n=100).

      The participants will be assessed for depression, anxiety, perceived stress level of impact,
      and impact of life events using Beck Depression Inventory, State Trait Anxiety Inventory,
      Perceived Stress Scale, and Impact of Events Scale-Revised respectively. A qualitative
      interview schedule will be carried out.
