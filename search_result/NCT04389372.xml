    <textblock>
      Chronic Migraine is a disabling condition that affects the 2% of migraine population. It is
      often associated with medication overuse that makes this condition very difficult to treat.
      The literature of the last decades confirm the efficacy of withdrawal for patients with
      medication overuse but it is also confirmed that patients have to be carefully followed in
      the last period after withdrawal to avoid relapses and to improve the clinical benefit of the
      therapeutic approach. It has been also reported how the clinical results can be improved when
      traditional therapies are combined with behavioral approaches in particular mindfulness, that
      help patient to become more conscious about their symptoms and able to manage pain without
      medication. Generally patients after withdrawal follow a specific prophylaxis for migraine,
      but also come weekly to the hospital for practicing mindfulness for 6 sessionsAs the
      emergency situation due to the Corona-virus pandemic phenomenon in Italy, patients will miss
      the possibility to come for the regular practice to the hospital: for this reason the
      investigator propose a small pilot study to enforce the use of technology for our patients so
      that they can continue to be followed in their therapeutic process. This preliminary study
      will be conducted on 25 patients that have been submitted to a withdrawal according to the
      standard procedure at our hospital and they will practice mindfulness daily by a standard
      session of 12 minutes on their smartphone recorded by the expert who generally manage their
      sessions at the hospital and also a weekly video-call to evaluate the clinical condition and
      to encourage to use strategies for pain management. This modality will allow the patients to
      continue their therapeutic process and to be followed regularly during the one year after
      withdrawal

      Background and significance Chronic Migraine is a disabling condition that affects the 2% of
      migraine population. It is often associated with medication overuse that makes this condition
      very difficult to treat. The literature of the last decades confirm the efficacy of
      withdrawal for patients with medication overuse. Also, patients need to be carefully followed
      after withdrawal to avoid relapses in overuse and to improve the clinical benefit. It has
      been also reported that the clinical results can be improved if traditional therapies are
      combined with behavioral approaches in particular mindfulness, that help patients to become
      more conscious about their symptoms and able to manage pain without medication.

      This preliminary study will be performed because the emergency for Covid-19 with the
      restrictions imposed will not allow patients. The literature of the last decades promote the
      use of smart phone or telemedicine for clinical and therapeutic application with encouraging
      results. Twenty five patients that have been submitted to a withdrawal according to the
      standard procedure at our hospital will practice mindfulness daily by a standard session of
      12 minutes on their smartphone recorded by the expert who generally manage their sessions at
      the hospital. Also a weekly video-call to evaluate the clinical condition and to encourage to
      use strategies for pain management will be scheduled.

      This modality will allow the patients to continue their therapeutic process and to be
      followed regularly during the one year after withdrawal
