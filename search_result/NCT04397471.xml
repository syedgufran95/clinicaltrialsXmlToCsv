  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic, commonly referred to as &quot;coronavirus&quot;, first began in the city of
      Wuhan, China in December 2019. This virus has since spread globally, with infections reported
      in nearly every country. COVID-19 targets the body's respiratory system, where infections can
      be found in the nose, throat and lungs. The effect of COVID-19 infection is very variable,
      where many people might not know that they have been infected and have recovered from
      COVID-19. However, COVID-19 infection can cause people to have difficulty breathing. This can
      be severe enough to require hospitalisation and potentially intensive care treatment.

      While they are being treated in hospital, COVID-19 infected patients can be found to have
      inflamed tissue in their lungs (referred to medically as &quot;pneumonitis&quot;). This inflammation is
      thought to be caused by their body's immune systems overacting to the infection rather than
      the COVID-19 virus itself. By potentially dampening down this overreaction of their immune
      system, it is hoped that COVID-19 patients with inflamed lungs have better and quicker chance
      to survive.

      Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and healing
      properties on injured tissue. MSCs have been trialled in various diseases but have not yet
      been tested on patients with COVID-19. In this study, the investigators will obtain bone
      marrow from healthy volunteers to develop a cell-based treatment for COVID-19-related
      pneumonitis. The investigators will also determine whether it is feasible to recruit bone
      marrow donors in a clinically useful timeframe to treat COVID-19 patients. A future trial,
      COMET20, will use the bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) manufactured in COMET20d to treat
      COVID-19 patients suffering with pneumonitis, to determine whether the BMMSCs can reduce the
      likelihood for mechanical ventilation and reduce hospitalisation.
