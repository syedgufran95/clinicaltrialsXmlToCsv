  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the French government put in place home quarantine of
      the general population in order to limit the transmission of the virus. It is obvious that
      quarantine at home have a psychological impact which could worsened cardiovascular risk. Our
      aim is to assess risk factors for severe stress, anxiety or depression, during and after
      quarantine, as well as risk factors (including stress, anxiety or depression), in the
      worsening of cardiovascular risk.

      In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the French government put in place home quarantine of
      the general population in order to limit the transmission of the virus. It is obvious that
      quarantine at home have a psychological impact which could worsened cardiovascular risk. Our
      aim is to assess risk factors for severe stress, anxiety or depression, during and after
      quarantine, as well as risk factors (including stress, anxiety or depression), in the
      worsening of cardiovascular risk.

      A prospective epidemiological observational cohort study will be carried out (in French
      general population aged 50 to 89 years) with data collection by telephone interviews (in
      agreement with the context of quarantine).

      The telephone interviews will be carried out during quarantine (V1), in the month following
      the end of quarantine (V2) and then, at 6 (V3) and 12 (V4) months. At baseline, the
      questionnaire will focus on socio-demographic and contextual characteristics related to the
      COVID-19 outbreak, medical history, cardiovascular risk factors and treatments, anxiety and
      depression scales. Next (after the quarantine), the questionnaire will focus on the evolution
      of cardiovascular risk factors and the occurrence of acute cardiovascular events, the
      evolution of treatments and post-traumatic stress, anxiety or depression scales.

      The assessment of risk factors for severe stress, anxiety or depression, during and after
      quarantine, as well as risk factors of the worsening of cardiovascular risk will be based on
      mixed logistic regression.

        A sample of 1600 subjects was randomly recruited from the general population to participate
        in the MONALISA cross-sectional surveys on the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in
        2005. Men and women aged 35-74, living in Toulouse area, were recruited between 2005 and
        2008.

        The participants of the MONALISA population survey had agreed to be contacted, after the
        end of the MONALISA study, to take news of their state of health.

        Considering that the participation rate of the people contacted will be high (greater than
        70%, taking into account the quarantine context), more than 800 participants (now aged 50
        to 89 years) should be able to be included.
