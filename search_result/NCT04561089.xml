  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;This is a prospective, multi-center specimen collection study. Subjects 18 years of age or
      older who do not have symptoms of COVID-19 will be enrolled. Two nasal swab samples and one
      saliva sample will be collected from each subject. The saliva sample will be tested with the
      COVIDSeq Test and one nasal swab will be tested with an EUA approved COVID test. The other
      nasal swab sample will be stored and a subset (approximately 250 specimens) will be tested
      with the COVIDSeq Test. Results of all testing will be provided to the sponsor for
      statistical analysis.

      Positive results from COVIDSeq Test using saliva and/or the comparator EUA test will be
      provided to subjects so they can be referred for further evaluation (outside the study). No
      medical treatment, guidance on treatment decisions, nor medical care will be provided. &quot;
