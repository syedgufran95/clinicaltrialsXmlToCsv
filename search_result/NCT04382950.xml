      B38-CAP is a bacteria-derived ACE2-like enzyme that suppresses hypertension and cardiac
      dysfunction Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is critically involved in cardiovascular
      physiology and pathology, and is currently clinically evaluated to treat acute lung failure.
      Here we show that the B38-CAP, a carboxypeptidase derived from Paenibacillus sp. B38, is an
      ACE2-like enzyme to decrease angiotensin II levels in mice. In protein 3D structure analysis,
      B38-CAP homolog shares structural similarity to mammalian ACE2 with low sequence identity. A
      study demonstrated that the bacterial B38-CAP as an ACE2-like carboxypeptidase, indicating
      that evolution has shaped a bacterial carboxypeptidase to a human ACE2-like enzyme. Bacterial
      engineering could be utilized to design improved protein drugs for hypertension and heart
      failure. pretreatment of B38-CAP markedly down regulated a massive increase of plasma Ang II
      levels at 5 min after Ang II injection In addition to the currently used drugs to inhibit Ang
      II generation or signaling, such as ACE inhibitors or Angiotensin receptor blockers, direct
      down-modulation of Ang II levels by rhACE2 protein is one of the promising candidates for new
      therapeutic strategy in cardiovascular disease and other Ang II-related diseases, e.g. ARDS.
      On the other hand, although mass production of rhACE2 as a protein drug costs due to
      requirement of mammalian cell expression systems, B38-CAP is easily prepared with E. coli
      expression system and is cost effective. Therapeutic efficacy and less toxicity in mouse
      heart failure models would warrant further investigation of B38-CAP or other microbial
      carboxypeptidases in disease models. Finally the principal investigator expects that
      treatment with ACE2-like enzyme of bacteria B38-CAP expected to work efficiently Like human
      ACE2 and it will save the lung cells from COVID - 19 inhibitory effect and down regulation of
      ACE2 because COVID-19 binds to human ACE2 and down regulates it and this receptors is very
      important for lung cells survival and function So ,the principal investigator also expects
      that B38-CAP ACE2 like enzyme may be not recognized by COVID -19 spike protein because
      evolutionary it is too far away from human ace2 and human ACE2 is a real receptor of COVID
      -19 not ACE2 like enzyme but in the same time it will make the same function of human ACE2 In
      another study by Sinha et al who analyzed a publicly available Connectivity Map (CMAP)
      dataset of pre/post transcriptomic profiles for drug treatment in cell lines for over 20,000
      small molecules, isotretinoin was the strongest down-regulator of ACE 2 receptors. On the
      other hand, they found 6 drugs in CMAP that are currently being investigated in clinical
      trials for treating COVID-19 (chloroquine, thalidomide, methylprednisolone, losartan,
      lopinavir and ritonavir, from clinicaltrials.gov), none of which was found to significantly
      alter ACE2 expression (P&gt;0.1) Moreover, another study demonstrated that isotretinoin is a
      Potential papain like protease (PLpro) inhibitors which is a protein encoded by SARS-CoV-2
      genes and considered one of the proteins that should be targeted in COVID-19 treatment by
      performing target-based virtual ligand screening . So, the principal investigator expects
      strong inhibition of COVID - 19 infection And rescuing the lung cells from its serious attack
      by treating with ACE2 like enzyme and Isotretinoin

      This is a small pilot study investigating whether there is any efficacy signal that warrants
      a larger Phase 2B trial, or any harm that suggests that such a trial should not be done. It
      is expected to produce statistically significant results in the major endpoints. The
      investigator will examine all of the biologic, physiological, and clinical data to determine
      whether a Phase 2B trial is warranted.

        -  Primary efficacy analysis will be carried only on patients receiving at least 4 doses of
           active combination drug. Safety analysis will be carried out on all patients receiving
           at least one dose of active drug. It is planned to enroll more than or equal to 24
           subjects with COVID-19. It is expected to have at least 12 evaluable patients in each
           group.

      Introduction

      Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors mediate the entry into the cell of three
      strains of coronavirus: SARS-CoV, NL63 and SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 receptors are ubiquitous and
      widely expressed in the heart, vessels, gut, lung (particularly in type 2 pneumocytes and
      macrophages), kidney, testis and brain. ACE2 is mostly bound to cell membranes and only
      scarcely present in the circulation in a soluble form. An important salutary function of
      membrane-bound and soluble ACE2 is the degradation of angiotensin II to angiotensin1-7.
      Consequently, ACE2 receptors limit several detrimental effects resulting from binding of
      angiotensin II to AT1 receptors, which include vasoconstriction, enhanced inflammation and
      thrombosis. The increased generation of angiotensin1-7 also triggers counter-regulatory
      protective effects through binding to G-protein coupled Mas receptors. Unfortunately, the
      entry of SARS-CoV2 into the cells through membrane fusion markedly down-regulates ACE2
      receptors, with loss of the catalytic effect of these receptors at the external site of the
      membrane. Increased pulmonary inflammation and coagulation have been reported as unwanted
      effects of enhanced and unopposed angiotensin II effects via the ACE→Angiotensin II→AT1
      receptor axis. Clinical reports of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 show that several
      features associated with infection and severity of the disease (i.e., older age,
      hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) share a variable degree of ACE2 deficiency.
      We suggest that ACE2 down-regulation induced by viral invasion may be especially detrimental
      in people with baseline ACE2 deficiency associated with the above conditions. The additional
      ACE2 deficiency after viral invasion might amplify the dysregulation between the 'adverse'
      ACE→Angiotensin II→AT1 receptor axis and the 'protective' ACE2→Angiotensin1-7→Mas receptor
      axis. In the lungs, such dysregulation would favor the progression of inflammatory and
      thrombotic processes triggered by local angiotensin II hyperactivity unopposed by
      angiotensin1-7. In this setting, recombinant brACE2 could be promising therapeutic approaches
      in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      Rescuing The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by B38-CAP ACE2 which is a bacteria-derived
      ACE2-like enzyme

      The expected benefits of B38-CAP derived ACE2-like enzyme depending on previous research data
      show that B38-CAP derived ACE2-like enzyme will do the same function of human ACE2 and in the
      same time it will be resistant to COVID- spike protein because evolutionary it is too far
      away from human ace2 and human ACE2 is a real receptor of COVID -19 not ACE2 like enzyme and
      this discussed as follow :

      B38-CAP is a bacteria-derived ACE2-like enzyme that suppresses hypertension and cardiac
      dysfunction Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is critically involved in cardiovascular
      physiology and pathology, and is currently clinically evaluated to treat acute lung failure.
      Here we show that the B38-CAP, a carboxypeptidase derived from Paenibacillus sp. B38, is an
      ACE2-like enzyme to decrease angiotensin II levels in mice. In protein 3D structure analysis,
      B38-CAP homolog shares structural similarity to mammalian ACE2 with low sequence identity. In
      vitro, recombinant B38-CAP protein catalyzed the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin
      1-7, as well as other known ACE2 target peptides. Treatment with B38-CAP suppressed
      angiotensin II-induced hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis in mice. Moreover,
      B38-CAP inhibited pressure overload-induced pathological hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis,
      and cardiac dysfunction in mice. Our data identify the bacterial B38-CAP as an ACE2-like
      carboxypeptidase, indicating that evolution has shaped a bacterial carboxypeptidase to a
      human ACE2-like enzyme. Bacterial engineering could be utilized to design improved protein
      drugs for hypertension and heart failure. On the contrary Treatment with recombinant human
      ACE2 protein (rhACE2), which is devoid of its membrane-anchored domain thus soluble, has been
      demonstrated to exhibit beneficial effects in various animal models including heart failure,
      acute lung injury, and diabetic nephropathy, and so forth. rhACE2 is currently tested in the
      clinic to treat ARDS and COVID-19 infected patients . Using cell cultures and organoids,
      researchers from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of British Columbia
      (UBC) in Canada, showed that by adding a genetically modified variant of ACE2, called human
      recombinant soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hrsACE2), COVID-19 was prevented from
      entering cells. The paper, published in Cell, shows that hrsACE2 had a dose dependent effect
      of viral growth of SARS-CoV-2 and was able to reduce it by a factor of 1,000 to 5,000 in cell
      cultures. Despite its beneficial effects, rhACE2 is a glycosylated protein and thus its
      preparation requires time- and cost-consuming protein expression system with mammalian or
      insect cells, which may not be advantageous in drug development and medical economy Although
      it had been reported that an immune response is associated with the chronic infusion of
      rhACE2 resulting in the degradation of rhACE226, this was not observed for B38-CAP; there
      were no antibodies against B38-CAP detectable in the serum of mice infused with B38-CAP for 2
      weeks. Implantation of B38-CAP-filled osmotic mini-pumps significantly suppressed Ang
      II-induced hypertension in conscious mice .without affecting the heart rate. These results
      indicate that B38-CAP antagonizes the vasopressor effect of Ang II. So the principle
      investigator expects and suggests that treating with cloned Bacterial ACE2 receptors -like
      enzyme of B38-CAP could be promising COVID-19 infection- and lung injury preventing drug
      better than recombinant human ACE2 in addition to brsACE2, expected to lure the virus to
      attach itself to the copy instead of the actual cells… It distracts the virus from infecting
      the cells to the same degree and should lead to a reduction in the growth of the virus in the
      lungs and other organs. A study showed that recombinant B38-CAP protein downregulates Ang II
      levels in mice and antagonizes Ang II-induced hypertension, pathological cardiac hypertrophy,
      and myocardial fibrosis. A study showed beneficial effects of B38-CAP on the pathology of
      pressure overload-induced heart failure in mice without overt toxicities and also
      pretreatment of B38-CAP markedly downregulated a massive increase of plasma Ang II levels at
      5 min after Ang II injection In addition to the currently used drugs to inhibit Ang II
      generation or signaling, such as ACE inhibitors or Angiotensin receptor blockers, direct
      down-modulation of Ang II levels by rhACE2 protein is one of the promising candidates for new
      therapeutic strategy in cardiovascular disease and other Ang II-related diseases, e.g. ARDS.
      On the other hand, although mass production of rhACE2 as a protein drug costs due to
      requirement of mammalian cell expression systems, B38-CAP is easily prepared with E. coli
      expression system and is cost effective. Therapeutic efficacy and less toxicity in mouse
      heart failure models would warrant further investigation of B38-CAP or other microbial
      carboxypeptidases in disease models. Furthermore, human ACE2-like enzyme in bacteria might
      pave the way to a new strategy to engineer evolution of bacterial proteins for better
      designing and preparations of recombinant protein drugs Finally the principal investigator
      expect that treatment with ACE2-like enzyme in bacteria B38-CAP may be do the same mechanism
      of rhACE2 in inhibiting COVID -19 and the other suggested mechanism is that ACE2-like enzyme
      in bacteria B38-CAP injection in human body will do the same function of human ACE2 and in
      the same time it will be resistant to COVID- spike protein because evolutionary it is too far
      away from human ace2 and human ACE2 is a real receptor of COVID -19 not ACE2 like enzyme and
      Also among three bacterial carboxypeptidases we tested, only B38-CAP showed dependence of
      proteolytic activity on anion concentration, which is characteristic of ACE2 activity.
      B38-CAP also showed pH optimum of 7.5 equivalent to rhACE2.In addition, IC50 of MLN-4760 was
      also equivalent between rhACE2 and B38-CAP. Although B38-CAP exhibited quite similar
      proteolytic activity to rhACE2, there seems a difference in substrate specificity between two
      enzymes So , the principal investigator also expects that B38-CAP ACE2 like enzyme may be not
      recognized by COVID -19 spike protein but in the same time it will make the same function of
      human ACE2 in addition to down regulating of human ACE2 which is the real receptor of COVID
      -19

      Blocking of ACE2 receptor of COVID -19 which is the real receptors of it

      Isotretinoin(13cis RA) may be able to inhibit COVID 2019 entry via down regulation of ACE2
      via action like shRNA targeting ACE2 gene expression and this is discussed as follow :

      The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-COV-2 has infected over 2,000,000 people causing over
      150,000 deaths. A key host cellular protein required for the virus entry is
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) whose expression has been demonstrated in many tissues
      including alveolar epithelial type II cells in lungs, oral mucosa and intestine, heart,
      kidney, endothelium and skin. ACE2-expressing cells can act as home cells and are prone to
      SARS-CoV-2 infection as ACE2 receptor facilitates cellular viral entry and replication. A
      study demonstrated that patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus may be at higher
      risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as these patients are often treated with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs)
      or angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs), which have been previously suggested to
      increase ACE2 expression. In another study by Sinha et al who analyzed a publicly available
      Connectivity Map (CMAP) dataset of pre/post transcriptomic profiles for drug treatment in
      cell lines for over 20,000 small molecules, isotretinoin was the strongest down-regulator of
      ACE 2 receptors. On the other hand, they found 6 drugs in CMAP that are currently being
      investigated in clinical trials for treating COVID-19 (chloroquine, thalidomide,
      methylprednisolone, losartan, lopinavir and ritonavir, from clinicaltrials.gov), none of
      which was found to significantly alter ACE2 expression (P&gt;0.1) Moreover, another study
      demonstrated that isotretinoin is a Potential papain like protease (PLpro) inhibitors which
      is a protein encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes and considered one of the proteins that should be
      targeted in COVID-19 treatment by performing target-based virtual ligand screening as the
      Principal Investigator discussed before that (13cRA) is the strongest down-regulator of ACE2.
      and the principal investigator expects that 13cRA can inhibit and downregulat ACE2 expression
      ,Suggesting its therapeutic potential in preventing the entry of COVID 2019 to the host cell.
