    <textblock>
      This treatment protocol is designed to provide a treatment option for patients diagnosed with
      severe or life-threatening COVID-19 or judged by the subinvestigator (treating physician) to
      be at high risk of progressing to severe or life threatening disease

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an expanded access open-label, single-arm, multi-site protocol to provide
      convalescent plasma as a treatment for patients diagnosed with severe, or life-threatening
      COVID-19. Efficacy of this treatment will not be evaluated. A single site will initially be
      established. When additional patients needing therapy are identified at other health care
      facilities, Force Health Protection (FHP) will send a protocol package, and a site will be
      established and approved by the Headquarters USAMRDC Institutional Review Board (HQ IRB)

        Inclusion Criteria:

        A patient must meet the following criteria to be included in this protocol:

          -  DoD personnel covered by the Force Health Protection (FHP) program under the
             Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 6200.02 (active duty service members OCONUS
             and CONUS) and non-DoD personnel who may be treated for COVID-19 at Military Treatment
             Facilities (MTFs) under the authority of DoDI 6200.03, including Military Health
             System (MHS) beneficiaries, patients admitted to MTFs, and patients cared for under
             defense support for civilian authorities (e.g. hospital ships, field hospitals
             deployed for the COVID-19 response).

          -  Laboratory confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis

          -  Severe or life threatening COVID-19 disease, or judged by the sub-investigator
             (treating physician) to be at high risk for progression to severe or life-threatening
             disease

          -  Informed consent provided by the patient or legally authorized representative (LAR),
             except in situations described in 21 CFR 50.23

          -  Understands and agrees to comply with planned protocol procedures

          -  Patient agrees to storage of specimens for future testing.

        Generally, treatment should be reserved for patients with severe or life-threatening
        COVID-19 defined as:

        Severe COVID-19 in adults is defined by one or more of the following:

          -  Dyspnea

          -  Respiratory frequency &gt;/= 30/min

          -  Blood oxygen saturation &lt;/= 93%

          -  Partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio &lt; 300

          -  Lung infiltrates &gt; 50% within 24 to 48 hours; i.e. infiltrates increase by &gt; 50% in
             less than 2 days

        Life-threatening COVID-19 is defined as one or more of the following:

          -  Respiratory failure

          -  Septic shock

          -  Multiple organ dysfunction or failure

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Any patient not meeting the inclusion criteria will not be eligible to receive this
        treatment. Patients will not be excluded because of receipt of another investigational
        COVID-19 treatment, for example: Remdesivir, unless the treating physician sub-investigator
        (treating physician) feels that the patient would be put at risk by receiving multiple
        investigational therapies.
