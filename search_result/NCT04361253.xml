  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators will determine whether the early addition of HT-CCP to standard
      treatment improves the clinical outcome (as assessed by the Modified WHO Ordinal Scale) of
      patients with COVID-19 who are hospitalized but not yet in moderate or severe ARDS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators are doing this research to learn more about high-titer COVID-19 convalescent
      plasma (HT-CCP) transfusion as a possible treatment for people who have COVID-19, the
      coronavirus infection. &quot;HT-CCP&quot; is plasma that contains a high amount of antibodies that were
      made to fight off COVID-19 because it is donated by another person who has also been infected
      with coronavirus but has recovered, so their immune system has had enough time to make these
      antibodies. This study is being done to determine whether HT-CCP will help people with
      COVID-19 recover from their infection more quickly and lower their risk of having to go on a
      ventilator or reduce the time they need to stay on a ventilator. It is not yet known whether
      HT-CCP helps people with COVID-19, which is why the study needs to be randomized, meaning
      some subjects will be randomly selected to receive HT-CCP while others will be randomly
      selected to receive FFP.

The eligibility requirements for this trial select individuals at level 3 or higher on the modified scale, but the day 14 outcome can be any one of 10 levels.</description>

    <description>Two units of apheresis HT-CCP, collected from the same donor whenever possible, will be administered sequentially over no greater than a 24-hour period to participants randomized to Arm A. Each unit of HT-CCP will be approximately 250 mL, for a total transfused volume of approximately 500 mL.</description>

    <description>Two units of FFP or FP24 (each 200-275 mL, approximately 500 mL total) will be administered sequentially to participants randomized to Arm B. (FFP/FP24 unit volumes vary more than apheresis plasma units. Two FFP/FP24 units that are approximately 250 mL apiece will be provided.)</description>
