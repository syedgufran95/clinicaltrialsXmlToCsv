  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthcare centers treated several hundreds of patients with Covid-19 and prospectively
      gathered information in electronic format between March, 2020 to April, 2020. In the course
      of Covid-19 treatment, physicians employed several drugs, including hydroxychloroquine,
      azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir, tocilizumab, baricitinib, sarilumab, corticosteroids and
      systematic antibiotics (list is not exhaustive).

      This cohort study aims to assess factors associated with clinical outcomes in patients
      hospitalized for Covid-19, by analyzing associations between treatments and outcomes.

      All data are collected in electronical records during routine practice.

      This cohort study aims to assess factors associated with clinical outcomes in patients
      hospitalized for Covid-19.

      Risk factors which will be studied include: baseline characteristics such as medical history
      and drugs with corresponding administration protocols.

      Main outcomes include all-cause mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, for ICU transfer
      and all relevant biological syndromes.

      All data are collected in electronical records during routine practice and additional data
      may be collected retrospectively.
