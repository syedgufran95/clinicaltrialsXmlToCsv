  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since early 2020, France knows a sanitary crisis with a massive influx of COVID-19 patients
      admitted in Intensive Care Units (ICU). It led to a saturation of the French health system,
      especially in some geographic areas such as East of France or Paris region. Therefore,
      authorities decided to transfer some critically ill patients from these crowded ICUs to less
      busy regional ICUs. it was done for the first time by medical train transportation. Knowing
      that the investigators lack experience regarding this type of medical evacuation, regarding
      the high number of transferred patients, with such a logistic effort, the investigators
      decided to study this phase of the COVID-19 sanitary crisis in order to draw a feedback. So
      far, there are no data in the literature regarding this topic.
