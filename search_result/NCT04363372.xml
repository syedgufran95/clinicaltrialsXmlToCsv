  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of MRx-4DP0004 in patients with COVID-19.

      90 hospitalised patients will be enrolled and randomised (2:1) to receive MRx-4DP0004 or
      placebo for up to 14 days.

      MRx-4DP0004 is an immunomodulating Live Biotherapeutic Product (LBP) which is expected to
      prevent or reduce the hyperinflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection without impairing
      viral clearance.
