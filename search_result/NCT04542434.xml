        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Part 1 only: Patients hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 with or
             without pneumonia, who are expected to remain in hospital at least seven days after
             the randomization and who accept continuing to be assessed for the study procedures
             (home or outpatient unit) up to 6 weeks in case of discharge.

        Part 2 only: Patients with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 with or without pneumonia who
        are not planned to be hospitalized.

          -  Patients who prior to developing COVID-19 usually have normal bowel habits defined as
             at least solid-formed 3 stools per week and no more than 3 solid-formed stools per
             day.

          -  SARS-CoV-2 RNA presence in rectal swab (or stool test) â‰¤2 days before randomization by
             local or central lab.

          -  Diarrhea defined as at least 3 watery stools in the last 24 hours prior to enrolment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  At the time of randomization patients requiring ICU admission or patients with severe
             respiratory insufficiency requiring mechanical ventilation or with rapid worsening of
             respiratory function leading to expectation for mechanical ventilation or ICU
             admission.

          -  Evidence of rapid clinical deterioration or existence of any life-threatening
             co-morbidity or any other medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator,
             makes the patient unsuitable for inclusion.
