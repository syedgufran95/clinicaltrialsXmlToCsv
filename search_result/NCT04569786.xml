  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of V590
      versus placebo and to assess the immunogenicity of V590 on Day 28. The primary hypothesis is
      that at least one well-tolerated dose of V590 increases the geometric mean titers (GMTs) of
      anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike serum neutralizing
      antibody, as measured by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), compared to placebo.
