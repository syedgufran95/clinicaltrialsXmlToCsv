    <textblock>
      The trial has two parts: Part A is for dose ranging with dose escalation and de-escalation
      plus the evaluation of interim dose levels. It also includes dose ranging in older subjects.
      Part B is dedicated to recruit expansion cohorts with dose levels which are selected from
      data generated in Part A. The vaccines BNT162a1, BNT162b1, BNT162b2, and BNT162c2 will be
      administered using a Prime/Boost (P/B) regimen. The vaccine BNT162c2 will also be
      administered using a Single dose (SD) regimen.
