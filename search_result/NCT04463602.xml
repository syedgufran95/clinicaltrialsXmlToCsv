      This study is a Phase 2b, Multicenter, Open-label, Randomized, Comparator- Controlled Study
      to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Desidustat Tablet for the Management of mild, moderate
      and severe COVID-19 patients. 100 mg of Desidustat will be administered for a period of 14
      days along with recommended standard care during the trial.

      This is a phase 2b, multicenter, open-label, randomized, comparator-controlled clinical trial
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Desidustat for the management of COVID-19 patients.
      First 12 mild to moderate subjects (Test arm: Desidustat + Standard of care arm, 06 subjects
      and Reference arm: Standard of care, 06 subjects) will be enrolled in the study and after
      evaluation of safety of these 12 subjects by Data Monitoring Committee other 12 severe
      subjects (Test arm: Desidustat + Standard of care arm, 06 subjects and Reference arm:
      Standard of care arm, 06 subjects) will be enrolled in the study.
