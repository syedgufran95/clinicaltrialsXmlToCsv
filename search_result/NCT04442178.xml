      Comparison of the effects of CYT107 vs Placebo administered IM at 10μg/kg twice a week for
      three weeks on immune reconstitution of lymphopenic COVID-19 patients
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately forty-eight (48) participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive

      (a) Intramuscular (IM) administration of CYT107 at 10 μg/kg followed, after 72hrs of
      observation, by 10 μg/kg twice a week for 3 weeks (maximum 7administrations adjusted to
      patient's length of stay in the hospital) or (b)Intramuscular (IM) placebo (normal saline) at
      the same frequency. The aim of the study is to test the ability of CYT107 to produce an
      immune reconstitution of these patients and observe possible association with a clinical
      improvement.

      This cohort excludes oncology patients on treatment
