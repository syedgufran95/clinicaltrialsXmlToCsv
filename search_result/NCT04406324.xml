      The current project is a prospective, multicentric cohort study aiming at a multidisciplinary
      assessment (pulmonary, cardiometabolic, sleep and mental health) of the consequences of
      infection by SARS-CoV-2, 3 months after the diagnosis in order to better characterize these
      complications. 400 patients with a positive diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 will be included in the
      study 3 months after their diagnosis: They will be followed at 6 months, 1 year, 3 years, and
      5 years, as function of their after-effects discovered at 3 months and their evolution.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Europe and in particular Italy, Spain and France are currently affected by the coronavirus
      2019-nCoV pandemic, whose immediate prognosis is linked to the development of acute
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Beyond the long-term adverse effects on respiratory
      health and reduced exercise capacity, other complications will occur. These include a more
      rapid progression of cardiometabolic diseases, a secondary epidemic of disabling
      post-traumatic stress disorder, and severe sleep disorders. The current project aims at a
      multidisciplinary assessment of respiratory, cardiac, sleep and mental health sequelae, three
      months after SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis in order to better characterize these complications.

      Three aspects will be targeted in this study : (i) long-term monitoring of deterioration in
      lung function, (ii) screening for sleep respiratory disorders (sleep apnea syndrome, obesity
      hypoventilation syndrome) and iii) characterization of sleep disorders and design of
      specialized intervention to improve sleep quality.

      This study is a prospective, multicentric cohort study that aims at constituting a cohort of
      400 patients who will be screened for pulmonary, cardiac, sleep, or psychological sequelae 3
      months after their diagnosis. They will be then followed for 5 years. The primary outcome
      will be the diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) 3 months after the diagnosis. Other
      secondary outcomes will include:

        -  prevalence of sleep disorders and sleep disordered breathing 3 months after diagnosis
           and their evolution until 5 years;

        -  prevalence of cardiac, exercise capacity, respiratory and ventilatory muscles
           impairments at 3 months and their evolution until 5 years;

        -  characterization of homogeneous groups of patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and
           have respiratory, cardiometabolic and/or sleep complications, 3 months after diagnosis
           (latent class analysis) and evaluate their evolution until 5 years

        -  determine the prevalence of radiological sequelae at 3 months, and their evolution until
           5 years

        -  determine the psycho-social impact (quality of life, post-traumatic stress, anxiety,
           productivity at work) at 3 months and its evolution until 5 years
