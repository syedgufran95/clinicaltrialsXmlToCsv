  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, proof of concept, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to
      evaluate the ability of LB1148 to attenuate pulmonary dysfunction associated with COVID-19
      pneumonia. The primary objective of this study is to determine if enteral administration of
      LB1148 will effect disease progression in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe
      COVID-19 via measurement of the proportion of subjects alive and free of respiratory failure
      at Day 28.

      The purpose of this study is to establish the safety and tolerability, along with preliminary
      evidence of efficacy, of LB1148 compared to placebo in hospitalized patients with moderate to
      severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19). All patients will be randomized into one of two
      treatment groups (LB1148 or Placebo) in a 1:1 ratio, and stratified by peripheral capillary
      oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≥ 93% on room air vs. &lt; 93% on room air, and by PF ratio (PaO2,
      arterial oxygen partial pressure, to FiO2, fractional inspired oxygen) of ≥ 300 mmHg vs. PF
      ratio of &lt; 300 mmHg at the time of Screening. (If PaO2 cannot be measured or acquired, SpO2
      may be substituted to calculate the PF ratio.) LB1148 contains 7.5 g tranexamic acid (TXA),
      polyethylene glycol (PEG), glucose, and electrolytes. A total of 700 mL of LB1148 will be
      administered enterally, as a split dose (350 mL, every 12 hours). Study drug is given as a
      single bolus, to be delivered orally or via nasogastric (NG) or orogastric (OG) tube. For
      those patients assigned to placebo, a total of 700 mL of placebo will be administered
      enterally, as a split dose (350 mL, every 12 hours). The placebo contains PEG, glucose, and
      electrolytes.
