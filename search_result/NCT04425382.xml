  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory
      Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. It was first isolated in Wuhan, China in December
      2019 and then rapidly spread to the rest of the world posing a severe threat to global
      health.

      Many therapeutics have been investigated for the treatment of this disease with inconclusive
      outcomes. Protease inhibitors are one of the proposed agents, but their use is limited to
      their significant drug interactions and side effects.

      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety outcomes of Darunavir/Cobicistat
      versus Lopinavir /Ritonavir in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Qatar.
