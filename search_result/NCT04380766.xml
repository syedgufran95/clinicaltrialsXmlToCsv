  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer (PC) is recognized as one of the most challenging tumors to deal with and
      it is still characterized by a poor long-term prognosis. However, treatment of PC in
      high-volume centers with the support of a multidisciplinary approach has widely demonstrated
      improvement both in terms of short- and long-term outcomes. The recent worldwide spread of
      Covid-19 pandemic significantly affected the healthcare systems of most countries in the
      world, particularly in red areas such as Italy, with more than 100.000 cases in a two-month
      time lapse. This inevitably reflected in a reorganization of hospital activities, including
      the diagnostic and therapeutic pathways for PC treatment. With the aim of giving an objective
      and real representation of the impact of Covid-19 on PC treatment, the investigator here
      propose a multicenter Italian observational study comparing a 6-month period before and
      during the Covid-19 pandemic. Only high-volume centers will be involved in the study. A
      comparison between the general, clinical, endoscopic and surgical outcomes will be performed
      by means of a global and month-by-month analysis between the two study periods.
