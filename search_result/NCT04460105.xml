    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics of
      lanadelumab administered by intravenous (IV) infusion when added to standard-of-care (SoC) in
      adults hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia.

      This study consists of two cohorts (Cohort 1 [Single-dose Cohort], and Cohort 2 [Repeat-dose
      Cohort]). Up to approximately 24 participants will be enrolled in this study, in which up to
      12 participants may be enrolled into Cohort 1. However, Cohort 1 will be closed upon
      implementation of Amendment 2. Approximately 12 participants will be enrolled in Cohort 2.
      Participants will be randomized in 3:1 ratio (9 lanadelumab: 3 placebo) in each Cohort.

    <description>Treatment-emergent adverse events are defined as Adverse events (AEs) with onset at the time of or following the start of treatment with study medication, or medical conditions present prior to the start of treatment but increasing in severity or relationship at the time of or following the start of treatment. SAE is any untoward clinical manifestation of signs, symptoms or outcomes (whether considered related to investigational product or not and at any dose: results in death, is lifethreatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital abnormality/birth defect, an important medical event. AESI will include hypersensitivity reactions, events of disordered coagulation such as bleeding AESI, hypercoagulable AESI. Number of participants with TEAEs including AESI and SAE will be assessed.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females 18 years of age or older at the time of signing of the informed
             consent form (ICF).

               3. Platelets &lt;= 75,000/μL

               4. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;= 3×upper
                  limit of normal (ULN); alkaline phosphatase (ALP) &gt;= 3×ULN; or total bilirubin
                  greater than (&gt;) 2×ULN (unless the bilirubin elevation is a result of Gilbert's
                  syndrome)

          -  Any significant condition (any surgical or medical condition) that, in the opinion of
