    <textblock>
      A multi-centre open-label two-arm randomised superiority clinical trial of two weeks of oral
      Azithromycin 500mg once daily versus usual care in adult patients presenting to secondary
      care with clinically-diagnosed COVID-19 but assessed as appropriate for initial ambulant
      (outpatient) management, in preventing progression to respiratory failure or death.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: Use of Azithromycin 500 mg once daily for 14 days is effective in preventing
      and/or reducing the severity of lower respiratory illness of COVID-19 disease at 28 days.

      Study design: Multi centre, prospective open label two-arm randomised superiority clinical
      trial of standard care and Azithromycin with standard care alone for those presenting to
      hospital with COVID-19 symptoms who are not admitted at initial presentation.

      Study setting: Patients being assessed by secondary care NHS hospitals in the UK.

      Participants: Adults, â‰¥18 years of age assessed in an acute hospital with clinical diagnosis
      of COVID-19 infection and where medically it is decided not to admit the patient and for the
      patient to be managed on an ambulatory (outpatient) care pathway at their usual residence
      (home or care home).

      Study schedule: Enrolment on day 0. Telephone follow up at day 14 day, and day 28. If
      admitted between randomisation and day 28, data will be collected until hospital discharge.

      Intervention: Azithromycin 500 mg orally once daily for 14 days. The first dose will be
      within 4 hours of randomisation. This is in addition to standard care as per local hospital
      advice for those patients with suspected COVID who are not admitted: i.e. symptomatic relief
      with rest, as-required paracetamol (where appropriate) and advice to seek further medical
      attention if significant worsening of breathlessness.

      Comparator: Standard care as per local hospital advice for those patients with suspected
      COVID who are not admitted: i.e. symptomatic relief with rest, as-required paracetamol (where
      appropriate) and advice to seek further medical attention if significant worsening of
      breathlessness.
