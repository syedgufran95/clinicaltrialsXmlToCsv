  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The etiological agent of the current pandemic is a (+)ssRNA virus. SARS-CoV-2 is infecting
      thousands of people in the world with a fatality rate that varies from 0.1 to 5% in affected
      countries, thereby causing enormous economic losses. Few antibiotics have shown any efficacy
      in their combat, but have not yet proven adequate to stop the spread of the disease, nor are
      there any approved vaccines at the moment. From experiments in plants ongoing infections by
      RNA viruses, using thermotherapy, which is the application of heat at a temperature between
      35-43 °C, the investigators know that raising the temperature affects the transcription of
      viral proteins due to the formation of small RNA molecules that interrupt the replication
      process by grouping in specific regions of the RNA molecule, preventing and inhibiting
      transcription. These small molecules are called small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). This feature
      has been used through thermotherapy in humans to combat the rapid replication of cells (i.e.
      cancer cells), attack cells infected by RNA viruses, and in the treatment of some parasitic
      infections.There are various commercially available devices for thermotherapy use in humans;
      they are mainly being used to ease muscle pain. They work by increasing the temperature in
      the range recommended for thermotherapy in humans 39-43 ° C. Therefore, the investigators
      consider this treatment modality can be used to aid in the elimination of SARS-CoV-2 from the
      human body, decreasing viral load, which could allow the immune system time for its control
      and elimination.

      Considering the nature of the causative agent of COVID-19, a (+)ssRNA virus, the
      investigators propose the use of thermotherapy as a modality for viral containment, thereby
      preventing the progression of the infection to severe cases. The investigators consider
      applying the intervention with thermotherapy mainly as an adjuvant therapy in high-risk
      patients. The most accessible thermotherapy delivery method the investigators have identified
      is the use of an electric chest pad for its wide and known clinical use, including its
      recommended use for patients with arthritis. The intensity of temperature delivered by the
      electric cushion should be placed on the first level (lowest level), to avoid discomfort to
      the patient. The electric cushion provides a continuous hour of regulated heat, with enough
      penetration to raise the external temperature of the area to 40-42 ° C, a temperature range
      at which facilitation of elimination of the virus is expected.

    <intervention_model_description>The application of an electric chest pad. The use of an electric cushion was chosen because it is designed to be used in human thermal therapy. The electric cushion provides a continuous hour of regulated heat, with enough penetration to raise the external temperature of the area to 40-42 ° C in which the death of the virus is expected.
It is a therapy designed to decrease viral load. It is not expected to have an effect on concomitant microorganisms such as bacteria or opportunists such as Candida albicans, so that when the concomitant infection is suspected, the antibiotic of choice should be given or continued, depending on the nature of the infection.</intervention_model_description>
