      COVID-19, which emerged in China in December 2019, has become a pandemic with its spread to
      many countries of the world. Although it is suggested that hospital admissions are reduced
      due to some reasons such as trauma, during COVID-19 pandemic, it is controversial whether
      in-hospital mortality rates changed. Therefore this multi-centered study aimed to determine
      how in-hospital mortality effected during the pandemic period according to the specific
      patient groups.

      COVID-19, which emerged in China in December 2019, has become a pandemic with its spread to
      many countries of the world. Although it is suggested that hospital admissions are reduced
      due to some reasons such as trauma, during COVID-19 pandemic, it is controversial whether
      in-hospital mortality rates changed. Therefore this multi-centered study aimed to determine
      how in-hospital mortality effected during the pandemic period according to the specific
      patient groups. Thus, in case of a pandemic, it will be a guide in which patient groups
      healthcare providers should be more careful about.
