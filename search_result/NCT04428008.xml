  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thymalfasin (thymosin alpha 1 or Ta1), the active pharmaceutical ingredient in ZADAXINÂ®
      injection, is a 28-amino acid synthetic peptide, identical to natural Ta1 produced by the
      thymus gland. Ta1 is a biological response modifier which activates various cells of the
      immune system, and is therefore expected to have clinical benefits in disorders where immune
      responses are impaired or ineffective, including acute and chronic viral and bacterial
      infections, cancers, and vaccine non-responsiveness. Patients with end-stage renal disease
      (ESRD) on hemodialysis, in addition to their intrinsic kidney disease and frequent burden of
      comorbidities, also have increased risk of exposure to communicable diseases as they are
      treated several times each week at hemodialysis centers with several other patients and
      clinic staff in attendance. The majority of patients are over 60 years of age and many are
      receiving immunosuppressive medications. Accordingly, ESRD patients are particularly
      susceptible to COVID-19 infection. Ta1 has been shown to be safely administered to
      hemodialysis patients. It is our hypothesis that a course of Ta1 administered to individuals
      with ESRD will reduce the rate and severity of infection with COVID-19.

      Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, in addition to their intrinsic
      kidney disease and frequent burden of comorbidities, also have increased risk of exposure to
      communicable diseases as they are treated several times each week at hemodialysis centers
      with several other patients and clinic staff in attendance. The majority of patients are over
      60 years of age and many are receiving immunosuppressive medications. Accordingly, ESRD
      patients are particularly susceptible to COVID-19 infection.

      Thymalfasin (thymosin alpha 1, Ta1) is a naturally occurring peptide that has been evaluated
      for its immunomodulatory activities and related therapeutic potential in several conditions
      and diseases, including infectious disease and cancer. ZADAXIN, a synthetic form of Ta1, been
      has been used clinically in pilot studies for treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome
      (SARS) and other lung infections including acute respiratory distress syndromeARDS) and
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), as well as infections after bone marrow
      transplant]. Larger clinical trials have shown significant efficacy for treatment of severe
      sepsis and hepatitis B, along with certain cancers such as melanoma, hepatocellular, and lung
      cancer. Ta1 has also demonstrated improvement in response to vaccines in the elderly and in
      patients immunocompromised by renal disease. The beneficial clinical effects of Ta1 result
      from activation of toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 in dendritic and other immune system cells,
      resulting in augmentation of T helper (Th1) function, natural killer (NK) cell activity, and
      increased antibody responses to T-cell dependent antigens. Importantly, Ta1 also leads to an
      increase in IL-10 producing regulatory T cells, which create feedback inhibition of cytokine
      production, hence dampening immune response and preventing a pro-inflammatory cytokine storm.

      It is our hypothesis that a course of Ta1 administered to individuals at high risk for
      COVID-19 infection (hemodialysis patients 60 years and older) will reduce the rate of
      COVID-19 infection and severity of infection with COVID-19, compared to untreated individuals
      in the same hemodialysis units with comparable risk. The study will also evaluate the need
      for hospitalization in those patients who do not become infected with COVID-19.
