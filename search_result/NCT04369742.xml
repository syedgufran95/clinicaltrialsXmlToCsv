  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatments for COVID-19 are urgently needed. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an antimalarial and
      immunomodulatory agent being repurposed for COVID-19 therapy based off in vitro data
      suggesting a possible antiviral effect. However, HCQ's effect on COVID-19 in human infection
      remains unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, we will enroll 626 adult patients hospitalized
      with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and randomize them 1:1 to a five-day course of HCQ or
      placebo. Notable exclusion criteria include ICU admission or ventilation on enrollment, prior
      therapy with HCQ, and baseline prolonged qTC. Our primary endpoint is a severe disease
      progression composite outcome (death, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, ECMO, , and/or
      vasopressor requirement) at the 14-day post-treatment evaluation. Notable secondary clinical
      outcomes include 30-day mortality, hospital length of stay, noninvasive ventilator support,
      and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) grading scale. Secondary exploratory objectives will
      examine SARS-CoV-2 viral eradication at the EOT, changes in COVID-19 putative prognostic
      markers and cytokine levels, and titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. This randomized trial
      will determine if HCQ is effective as treatment in hospitalized non-ICU patients with
      COVID-19.

             history of congenital qT prolongation, and/or history of cardiac arrest.

          7. Concomitant therapy with flecainide, amiodarone, digoxin, procainamide, propafenone,
             thioridazine, or pimozide
