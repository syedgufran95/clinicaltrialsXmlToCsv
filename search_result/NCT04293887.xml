  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New coronavirus infection is an important cause of public health emergencies at home and
      abroad, which seriously affects people's health and social stability. The outbreak of
      SRAR-COV in China in 2003 caused serious social impact. From January 2002 to August 7, 2003,
      there were a total of 8,422 cases worldwide, involving 32 countries and regions, of which 919
      cases were fatal, with a fatality rate of nearly 11%. The fatality rate of elderly patients
      and patients with underlying diseases was even more high.There is no precise and effective
      treatment for coronavirus infection. In vitro, IFN-α2β has inhibitory effects on MERS-CoV and
      closely related coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) -CoV. A study showed the
      effects of interferon-α2β and ribavirin on the replication of nCoV isolates hCoV-EMC / 2012
      in Vero and LLC-MK2 cells. The combined application may be useful for the management of
      patients with nCoV infection in the future. At present, the combination therapy of interferon
      α2β and ribavirin has been successfully applied in the initial treatment and prevention of
      SARS and MERS.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      recombinant human interferon α1β in treating patients with new coronavirus infection in
      Wuhan.

      This study is a multi-center, randomized, open, blank-controlled, multi-stage clinical study.
      As there are no effective treatments, the project team will evaluate possible treatments
      (including but not limited to interferon α) based on actual conditions. , Lopinavir /
      ritonavir, remdesivir, single / polyclonal antibodies against coronavirus), explore the most
      effective antiviral treatment options.

      The first phase will assess the efficacy and safety of interferon alpha compared to standard
      treatment for approximately 328 hospitalized adult patients diagnosed with a new coronavirus
      infection in Wuhan.

      Patients with COVID-19 within 7 days of onset of symptoms were screened and randomly assigned
      as soon as possible after screening (within 24 hours). Patients will be allocated in a 1: 1
      ratio, receiving the interferon alpha treatment group or only the standard treatment group.
      Patients who do not meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria are only allowed to be
      re-screened once, provided that the time from symptom onset to randomization remains within 7
      days.

      This study planned to randomize approximately 328 adult subjects. It will be stratified
      according to whether the onset time is ≤ 3 days, and randomly divided into groups of 1: 1,
      receiving standard treatment or interferon alpha atomization twice a day, 1 stick (10ug) each
      time, treatment course For 10 days. Subjects and all research center staff were not blinded.

      The primary endpoint of this study was the incidence of side effects within 14 days of
      enrollment. Therefore, a 14-day visit is essential for the data needed for this endpoint.
      Every effort should be made to ensure that this study visit is completed in a timely manner.

      Out-of-hospital treatment or discharge will reach the discharge standard on the day of
      implementation and will be implemented in accordance with the Health and Medical Commission's
      &quot;Unknown Viral Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan (Trial)&quot;. For patients treated outside
      the hospital or who have been discharged, final assessments are performed by phone and using
      a questionnaire (if applicable).
