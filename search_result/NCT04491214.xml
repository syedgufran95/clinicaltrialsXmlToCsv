  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients affected by new coronavirus infectious disease (COVID) were mostly hospitalized in
      ICU. This infection seems to cause widespread organ injury (i.e acute renal injury,
      neurological disorders, pulmonary embolism,…). It is therefore necessary to provide a
      framework for the follow up of patients. Moreover SARS-CoV-2 infection consequences remain
      unknow at this time. Study hypothesis is that COVID alters determining factors (physical or
      psychological) of quality of life after ICU hospitalisation. The aim of the study is to
      assess quality of life 3 months after ICU hospitalization.

      Secondary purposes of the study are 1) assessment of quality of life 6 months and the
      evolution between the third and the sixth months after ICU hospitalization 2) description
      patients care after 3 and 6 months ICU left and their clinical status 3) convening and
      providing a &quot;platform&quot; within several physicians (neurologist, biologist, pneumologist…) will
      be able to follow up patients and perform complementary investigations according to patients
      injuries.
