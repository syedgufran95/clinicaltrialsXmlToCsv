  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite being originated in Wuhan, in the China mainland region of the Hubei, Italy has been
      the hardest-hit country in the world by the COVID-19 pandemic during the month of March.

      Due to the uncontrollable spread of the contagion, the Italian Government has been forced to
      impose a series of restrictions and social distancing measures, culminating in the extension
      of lockdown to the entire Italian territory on March 8th.

      During this period, the general population has been overwhelmed by feelings of worry,
      anxiety, and discomfort. The discomfort is reinforced by the lengthening of the lockdown, to
      the point that it may be considered as a mass model of chronic or subchronic mild stress.

      The predictable effects of this stress on mental health have already been claimed,
      Post-traumatic symptoms were found in 7% among 285 Wuhan and surrounding cities' residents
      during the COVID-19 outbreak. A recent survey in the Italian general population reported
      similar outcomes.

      In this context, the psychic conditions of the most fragile ones, i.e. those already affected
      by a severe mental disorder, represent a major concern. Having a history of psychiatric
      illness is regarded as one of the most relevant predictors of a negative psychological impact
      of quarantine. Patients with severe mental disorders may be among the hardest hit subjects,
      as they may be more vulnerable by the COVID-19 outbreak for a series of clinical and
      psychological factors. In the Italian context, the vulnerability of these patients may be
      increased by the lockdown of mental health services as a consequence of mass quarantine and
      optimization of health resources toward action to contrast COVID-19-related sanitary
      emergencies.

      Despite several reports investigated the psychological effects of COVID-19 pandemic on
      health-care workers, COVID-19 affected people, or the general population, at the moment, no
      study has investigated the effects of the distress caused by fear of contagion and mass
      quarantine on severe mental disorder patients. The present study aimed at providing a first
      evaluation of anxiety, depressive, stress-related symptoms in these patients.

    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Significant differences among groups in the mean Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score, which measures the stress severity perceived by the subjects in the last month. The scale is constituted by 10 items that are self-rated by the subject on a 0-4 Likert scale. The scale minimum total score is 0, the maximum is 40. Higher total scores indicate a worse outcome</description>

    <measure>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Significant differences among groups in the mean Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale score, which measures anxiety symptoms' severity in the last two weeks. The scale is constituted by 7 items that are self-rated by the subject on a 0-3 Likert scale. The scale minimum total score is 0, the maximum is 21. Higher total scores indicate a worse outcome</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scale outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Significant differences among groups in the mean Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scale score, which measures depressive symptoms' severity in the last two weeks. The scale is constituted by 9 items that are self-rated by the subject on a 0-3 Likert scale. The scale minimum total score is 0, the maximum is 21. Higher total scores indicate a worse outcome</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Specific Psychotic Experiences Questionnaire (SPEQ) - Paranoia subscale outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Significant differences among groups in the mean Specific Psychotic Experiences Questionnaire (SPEQ) - Paranoia subscale score. The SPEQ scale is designed for the assessment of current sub-threshold psychotic symptoms in multiple domains. The Paranoia subscale measures persecutory/reference ideas and is constituted by 15 items that are self-rated by the subject on a 0-5 Likert scale. The subscale minimum total score is 0, the maximum is 75. Higher total scores indicate a worse outcome</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Specific Psychotic Experiences Questionnaire (SPEQ) - Grandiosity subscale outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Significant differences among groups in the mean Specific Psychotic Experiences Questionnaire (SPEQ) - Grandiosity subscale score. The Grandiosity subscale measures grandiosity/megalomaniac ideas and is constituted by 8 items that are self-rated by the subject on a 0-3 Likert scale. The subscale minimum total score is 0, the maximum is 24. Higher total scores indicate a worse outcome</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver Burden</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Significant correlations between mean Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) and mean scores on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The ZBI is designed for the assessment of caregiver burden. The scale is constituted by 22 items that are self-rated by the subject on a 0-4 Likert scale. The scale minimum total score is 0, the maximum is 88. Higher total scores indicate a worse outcome</description>
