  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to provide expanded access of S-nitrosylation therapy
      for the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) infection.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled trial for safety of a 6-hour escalating dose of S-nitrosylation therapy
      or placebo to ventilated patients. This will be a single-site study conducted within the
      UH-CMC medical ICU designated COVID-19 quarantine areas.

    <description>Total ventilator days:Ventilator Days will be recorded for each day through Day 30.

    <measure>Length of Intensive Care</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Total days in ICU: Intensive Care Unit Days will be recorded for each day through Day 30. Days will be counted in 24-hour periods, any partial days will be counted as a whole day. The level of ICU care needed will be recorded, based on clear definitions and specific clinical criteria in the covid-19 critical care procedure manual, as follows:
Level 1 - Mechanical ventilation and intensivist support. Patient is stable on lung protective equipment.
Level 2 - Advanced mechanical ventilation (capability to prone) and 24 hour intensivist support. Patient is hypoxic. Patient is stabilized on escalated ventilator settings (high PEEP, prone, etc.)
Level 3 - Advanced oxygenation/ventilation strategies, including ECMO and 24 intensivist support. Patient is severely hypoxic (ARDS), code status is discussed, palliative consult is discussed, RESP-ECMO parameters, and patient is ECMO candidate.</description>

    <description>Proportion of patients in each stage at maximum severity on the 7-point clinical status assessment ordinal scale.
Clinical status will be assessed using a 7-point ordinal scale as follows:
Death
Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO
Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices
Hospitalized, requiring low flow supplemental oxygen
Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care (COVID-19 related or otherwise)
