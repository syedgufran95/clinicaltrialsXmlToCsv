  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to collect information about the North Carolina community's
      coronavirus exposures, symptoms, and health care visits due to the virus. Participation in
      this study will involve completing a daily questionnaire which covers participants
      coronavirus illness history or symptoms, health care seeking behaviors and treatments,
      contact with other sick people, and for health care workers, their use of personal protective
      equipment.

      Investigators will conduct a prospective, cohort study for SARS-CoV-2 infections among
      clients and health care workers of Wake Forest Baptist Health (WFBH). Investigators will
      conduct real-time syndromic respiratory disease surveillance and, for SARS-CoV-2 infections,
      calculate baseline seroprevalence and seroconversion rates, hazard risks from close contacts,
      estimate efficacy of personal protective equipment, and assess sequelae incidence.
      Investigators will utilize the COVID-19 Therapeutic Learning System, an Oracle developed
      self-reporting data collection system that can be easily modified to address these specific
      questions. Over the course of the study, volunteers will report daily exposures, risk
      reduction behaviors, and symptoms through a secure app on their smartphone, tablet, or
      computer. In addition to daily syndromic surveillance, at baseline and once every month after
      that we will use a serologic IgM/G test kit to identify infections and reinfections in
      volunteers and send results to the Oracle developed database. The areas covered by this study
      are experiencing community spread of COVID-19 but are early enough in the epidemic to capture
      potentially a significant number of seroconversions over the 12 months of the study. This
      surveillance model will be expanded to include the clients and health workers of other
      medical agencies in North Carolina and in other states.
