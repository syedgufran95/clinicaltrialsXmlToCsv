  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about the effects of a medicine called baricitinib on the
      progression of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease of 2019), the medical condition caused by the
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Baricitinib is FDA-approved for
      the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune condition. This study intends to define
      the impact of baricitinib on the severity and progression of COVID-19. This drug might to
      lower the hyperinflammation caused by the virus, which would prevent damage to the lungs and
      possibly other organs.

      The study will recruit patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-19.

      The goal is to recruit 80 patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an adaptive Phase 2/3 clinical trial, with a focus on the assessment of safety in the
      first 20 participants (Phase 2), followed by a much broader assessment of efficacy, while
      continuing to monitor safety, in an additional 60 participants (Phase 3, total participants
      across Phase 2/3 n=80). Both phases are single arm, open label, and occur at a single site at
      the University of Colorado Hospital (UCH). Data from participants in this study will be
      compared with data from other COVID-19 patients not receiving baricitinib. Study participants
      will receive 2 mg/day of baricitinib for 14 days and will be followed for up to 29 days.

    <description>This study is an Adaptive Phase 2/3 trial designed to test the safety (Phase 2) and efficacy (Phase 2 and 3) of baricitinib to treat COVID-19. Phase 2 consists of a single-arm, open-label assignment of 20 participants receiving 2 mg baricitinib once daily for 14 days. Phase 3 consists of a single-arm, open-label assignment of 60 additional participants receiving baricitinib at the same dose. In both phases, participants will be monitored daily while hospitalized for 29 days, or until discharge, whichever occurs first. Participants who are discharged will be followed up with via phone on Day 15 and Day 29.</description>

          -  Provides informed consent signed by study patient or legally acceptable representative

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Absolute lymphocyte count is less than 500 cells/mm

          -  Absolute neutrophil count is less than 1000 cells/mm

          -  Hemoglobin level is less than 8 g/dL

          -  Estimated GFR is less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2

          -  ALT or AST is over 5 times the upper limit of normal

          -  Treatment with other JAK inhibitors, OAT3 inhibitors, biologic disease-modifying
             anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), anti-IL-6 or anti-IL-6R antibodies, or potent
             immunosuppressants such as azathioprine. and cyclosporine concurrently or within the
             past 5 days. Note: recent or concurrent treatment with hydroxychloroquine or
             chloroquine is allowable, as these are 'non-biologic' DMARDs with potential antiviral
             activity.

          -  History of HIV infection and on active immunosuppressant therapy

          -  Current hematological or solid organ malignancy and on active immunosuppressant
             therapy

          -  Active tuberculosis (TB) infection or known or suspected systemic bacterial or fungal
             infection

             screening

          -  Any physical examination findings and/or history of any illness that, in the opinion
             of the investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose an additional
             risk to the patient by their participation in the study

        Additional Exclusion Criteria for Phase 2 only:

        • Invasive oxygen supplementation, including mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal
        membrane oxygenation (ECMO)
