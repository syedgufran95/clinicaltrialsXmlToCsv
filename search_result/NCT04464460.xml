      The purpose of this study is to assess safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, and PK of
      TAK-671 in participants with COVID-19.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-671. The study will evaluate the safety,
      tolerability and PK of TAK-671 in participants admitted to the hospital with a confirmed
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive test.

      The study will enroll approximately 40 participants. Each cohort will have 20 participants.
      Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) in a 3:1 ratio to
      receive TAK-671 or placebo in each cohort, which will remain undisclosed to the participant
      during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Cohort 1: TAK-671 Low Dose

        -  Cohort 2: TAK-671 High Dose

      Enrollment in Cohort 2 will only begin once all 20 participants in Cohort 1 have reached Day
      7 post dose and have received positive review from the internal review committee (IRC) and
      approval to continue enrollment. All participants will receive the standard of care along
      with the study treatment.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 3 months. All participants will be followed up 28
      days after the infusion.

    <description>Sustained clinical improvement is defined as a 2-point improvement on the 8-point ordinal scale for clinical improvement, that is at least 2 points increase from the lowest score recorded since randomization and no worsening of the score afterwards by Day 28. An 8-point ordinal scale for clinical improvement in COVID-19 symptoms ranges from a score of 1 to a score of 8, where 1 (death), 2 (hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO), 3 (hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen devices), 4 (hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen), 5 (hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen, requiring ongoing medical care [COVID-19 related or otherwise]), 6 (hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen, no longer requires ongoing medical care), 7 (not hospitalized, limitation on activities and/or requiring home oxygen), and 8 (not hospitalized, no limitations on activities).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Days 7, 14, and 28</time_frame>
    <description>The SOFA score is a scale for describing multiple organ failure in the critical care setting. It is calculated using the functional status of several organ systems: respiratory, coagulation, liver, cardiovascular, central nervous system, and renal. Each of these organ systems is rated on a scale of 1 to 4, based on objective, testable criteria, chiefly laboratory values. The ratings of each of these systems (worse observed value during that 24-hour period) are then summed to create the total score. Each organ system is assigned a point value from 0 (normal) to 4 (high degree of dysfunction/failure). The minimum score is 0, the maximum score is 24, with higher scores indicating higher likelihood of worse outcome.</description>
