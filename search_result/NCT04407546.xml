  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of immunosuppressed individuals living in households with and without
      children to assess the role of household contact with children in the transmission of
      SARSCoV-2 to immunocompromised individuals. Through careful collection of epidemiological
      data in combination with biological specimens, risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 in
      immunocompromised individuals will be identified. During the initial visits, informed consent
      will be obtained and consented participants will complete an initial questionnaire and
      provide biological specimens including nasal swabs, saliva and blood. Thereafter,
      participants will complete at-home saliva collections and questionnaires on a weekly basis
      for 6 months. If our research-use only SARS-CoV-2 test is positive, participants will be
      referred immediately for medical attention and will be followed every 3 days with nasal swabs
      and saliva samples and weekly blood specimens and optional rectal swabs or fresh stool
      collection. Additionally, participants will be contacted by telephone at 1 year for
      follow-up.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study of immunosuppressed patients living in
      households with and without children to assess the role of household contact with children in
      the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to immunocompromised patients. This study will be enrolling
      both pediatric and adult patients who are immunosuppressed, as well as their household
      members who agree to participate. Through careful collection of epidemiological data in
      combination with biological specimens, risk factors for SARS- CoV-2 in immunocompromised
      patients will be identified. During the initial study visit, informed consent will be
      obtained, the study questionnaire will be completed and the participant will provide
      biological specimens including nasal mid-turbinate swabs, saliva and blood. Thereafter,
      participants will complete at-home saliva collections and questionnaires on a weekly basis
      for 6 months. If our research-use only SARS-CoV-2 test is positive, participants will be
      referred immediately to University of California at Los Angeles(UCLA) Health for medical
      attention and will be followed every 3 days with nasal swabs and saliva samples, and weekly
      blood specimens and optional rectal swabs or fresh stool collection. Biological specimen and
      questionnaire follow-up will occur for 6 months for uninfected participants or until the of
      end of viral shedding and immunologic profiling for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2,
      whichever is longer. All participants will be followed at 6 months with the same baseline
      measurements and then participants will be contacted by telephone at 1 year.

      The clinical data and biological specimens collected in this initial study will provide will
      inform and allow future studies of clinical outcomes, viral characteristics, and immune
      responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

  <eligibility>
    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Potentially eligible patients will be identified through examination of the electronic
        health record to identify patients receiving chemotherapy who are potentially eligible and
        could be approached for participation. Invitation to the study will occur through the
        MyChart portal or paper mailing letter, and those who are interested in participation will
        contact the research coordinator by phone or e-mail to undergo telephone screening for
        study eligibility. In addition, the research team member will explain the study objectives
        and procedures, and assess interest in participation. Pediatric recruitment of solid organ
        and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients will be done in collaboration with
        those respective primary pediatric subspecialist. The pediatric subspecialist teams will
        identify the patients who meet the inclusion criteria and will send the recruitment letter
        directly to the parents or patients if &gt;18 years old via MyChart or paper mailed letter.
