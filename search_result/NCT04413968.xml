    <textblock>
      According to epidemiological models, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in
      Île-de-France as of 11 May was between 10 and 15%. Preliminary data on the number of
      professionals evicted from nurseries on suspicion of COVID-19 (on clinical grounds) seem to
      be of the same order of magnitude, but need to be confirmed by a biological technique.
      Children would be susceptible to infection but often asymptomatic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV-2, an emerging respiratory virus of the coronavirus family, is responsible for a
      global pandemic of which Europe has become the epicentre. Infection with the virus causes a
      disease called COVID-19, whose expression most often includes cough, fever, fatigue, myalgia,
      anosmia, ageusia and gastrointestinal symptoms, and which can be complicated by severe
      pneumonia requiring resuscitation and which can lead to death. Morbidity and mortality are
      clearly age-related and while illness and hospitalisations occur in all age groups, deaths
      occur mostly in the older age groups.

      In the absence of curative treatment and vaccination, the only real measures capable of
      slowing the progression of the disease are large-scale social distancing measures. In analogy
      to community-based viral epidemics such as seasonal influenza, children were initially
      considered a potential vector of transmission, which led to the preventive measure of school
      closures. In France, this closure came into force on 14 March 2020.

      Children are considered to be little affected by the coronavirus-19 epidemic because even if
      screening strategies differ, they represent less than 3% of the cases confirmed in the
      various studies.

      In a period of confinement and reduction in the number of children cared for, in a crèche for
      children of healthcare workers, in a context of proximity and high risk of cross
      transmission, the frequency of symptomatic and asymptomatic forms of SARS-Cov-2 in children
      and staff would be comparable to the general population.

      We hypothesize a susceptibility to infection in children but low transmission, which should
      lead to a cumulative prevalence of infection among daycare staff comparable to that obtained
      in a sample of professionals who do not come into contact with children in their work (here
      hospital laboratory and administrative staff).
