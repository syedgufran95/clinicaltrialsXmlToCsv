    <textblock>
      People with cancer may be at higher risk of poor outcomes with COVID-19 infection. This
      observational study aims to describe the clinical course of COVID-19 infection in people with
      cancer and evaluate the utility of antibody and antigen tests for COVID-19. The results of
      this study will inform clinical practice in the management of cancer patients with COVID-19.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cancer are thought to have a weakened immune system and small observational
      case series have suggested patients with cancer are at a higher risk of poor outcome from
      COVID-19. However, the clinical course of COVID-19 infection amongst cancer patients is not
      known. In addition, it is unclear when it is appropriate for cancer patients who have
      recovered from COVID-19 infection to resume anti-cancer therapy.

      There is unmet need for diagnostic assays for COVID-19 including tests which can rapidly
      determine whether the virus has been cleared of the COVID-19. Lateral flow assays
      investigated in this study are rapid and simple diagnostic tools which can assist in timely
      diagnostics to inform clinical decision making.

      This observational study aims to describe the immunological dynamics and clinical course of
      COVID-19 in cancer patients and evaluate COVID-19 antibody and antigen lateral flow assays.

      The information from our study will add significantly to the understanding of COVID-19
      diagnostics and will improve the evidence-base for the management of cancer patients.
      Furthermore, data from this study could inform the timing and treatment for cancer patients
      who have recovered from COVID-19 infection.
