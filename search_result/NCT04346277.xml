      This protocol proposes to use IC14, a recombinant chimeric monoclonal antibody (mAb)
      recognizing human CD14, to block CD14-mediated cellular activation in patients early in the
      development of ARDS. The binding of IC14 to human CD14 prevents CD14 from participating in
      the recognition of PAMPs and DAMPs due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The putative mechanism of
      action of IC14 in ARDS is blockade of PAMP and DAMP interactions with CD14, thus attenuating
      the inflammatory cascade that leads to increased endothelial and epithelial permeability and
      injury resulting in alveolar injury and fluid accumulation characteristic of ARDS.

      IC14 is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds to CD14 with high affinity and inhibits
      signaling via membrane and soluble CD14. Blocking CD14 with IC14 treatment in normal
      volunteers strongly inhibits systemic inflammation in response to bacterial endotoxin (LPS).
      University of Washington conducted a small NIH-funded pilot trial of IC14 treatment in 13
      patients with ARDS, which suggested that IC14 treatment reduced alveolar inflammation and
      decreased BAL cytokines. IC14 was also the subject of IND 105803 for a phase 2 study of ARDS
      from all causes which we propose to revise for the COVID-19 indication.

      A dosing regimen for IC14 with favorable pharmacokinetics supporting once daily intravenous
      dosing has been defined, making this an acceptable treatment for hospitalized patients. Two
      pharmacodynamic biomarkers can be used that are related to CD14, measurements of sCD14 (serum
      at baseline; urine at baseline and follow up) as well as a CD14 fragment (sCD14-ST;
      presepsin). A CD14 target engagement assay is available.

      Therefore, because of the central role of CD14 in the amplification of lung inflammatory
      responses leading to severe lung injury and the safety record of IC14 in humans, we propose
      to have an open-label protocol to test the safety and potential efficacy of IC14 treatment in
      preventing the progression of severe respiratory disease in patients hospitalized with
      COVID-19.

    <textblock>
      This is a compassionate use open label program in patients hospitalized with pulmonary
      complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection who will receive IC14 at a dosage of 4 mg/kg on Day 1,
      then 2 mg/kg once daily on Days 2-4. Patient monitoring will be for a total of up to 28 days
      if the patient is still hospitalized.

      Screening/baseline assessments and initiation of the first IC14 administration will occur
      within 48 hours after meeting inclusion criteria. IC14 should be administered at
      approximately 24-hr intervals beginning from the start time of the first IC14 administration
      (Day 1).
