  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies low-dose radiation therapy as a focal anti-inflammatory
      treatment for patients with pneumonia or SARS associated with COVID-19 infection.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To compare treatment of COVID-19 between best supportive care plus provider's treatment
      choice versus best supportive care plus low-dose, whole-lung radiation therapy

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo 1 fraction of low-dose radiation therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 1-7, and 14 after last
      dose of intervention.

    <description>The rate will be reported, along with a two-sided 95% exact binomial confidence interval, using the Clopper-Pearson method. The observed extubation rate will be compared to the null rate of 20% using a two-sided binomial test. Statistical significance is assessed at the 0.05 level.</description>
