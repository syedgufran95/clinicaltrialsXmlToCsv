             requiring supplemental oxygen; Hospitalized, requiring any supplemental oxygen;
             Hospitalized, requiring non-invasive ventilation or use of high flow oxygen devices.

          -  Admission to hospital AND have a confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory
             syndrome coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction
             (PCR) test AND displays at least one of the following: Respiratory rate &gt; 24 breaths

          -  Capable of complying with all study restrictions and procedures including ability to
             use the pMDI correctly.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in any other clinical trial of an experimental treatment for COVID-19,
             unless related to an expanded access program as part of Standard of Care at screening
             or during study.

          -  Evidence of multiorgan failure.

          -  Requiring mechanical ventilation at screening.

          -  Allergy or other contraindication or one of ensifentrine.

          -  In the opinion of the clinical team, progression to death is imminent and inevitable
             within the next 24 hours, irrespective of the provision of treatments.

          -  Use of prohibited medications (theophylline, PDE4 inhibitors [e.g. roflumilast,
             apremilast, crisaborole] within 48 hours of screening or during study)

          -  Any other reason that the Investigator considers makes the patient unsuitable to
             participate.
