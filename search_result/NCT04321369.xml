      Operational project to compare clinician collected nasopharyngeal (NP) samples to
      patient-obtained tongue, nasal and mid-turbinate (MT) samples in the detection of SARS-CoV-2
      in an outpatient clinic setting
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This work will serve both the Everett Clinic and broader UnitedHealth Group patient
      populations as well as advance the public health emergency (PHE) response to the community
      spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus, especially as the number of cases and deaths continues to rise in
      many geographies. Leveraging our presence in the Seattle/Puget Sound area with Everett
      Clinic, we intend to develop a model that can screen a large number of patients at varying
      levels of risk and manifestation of clinical symptoms while conserving personal protective
      equipment (PPE) and decreasing transmission risk to health care workers. This will also serve
      to support the enterprise and public health response. Towards this goal, we must first assess
      the equivalence between clinician-collected nasopharyngeal (NP) samples to patient-collected
      tongue, nasal, and mid-turbinate (MT) samples to detect SARS-CoV-2 across a broad
      cross-section of the population.

    <ipd_description>All patients who participate in this operational pilot will have standard COVID-19 screening information entered into their electronic medical record. The collection locations and source of collection (medical personnel versus patient) will need to be clearly distinguished for the purposes of this project. Data resulting from analysis of the samples will also be stored in the electronic medical record and any positive results will be reported accordingly to public health officials as required. The data collected due to this operational effort will be extracted from the medical record and stored for additional research analysis to demonstrate equivalence between location in the nose for the collection of the sample and similarity between sample collected by medical personnel and samples collected by the patient. Data will be shared between the participating clinics, UHG and collaborating partners performing the analysis of the samples and returning results.</ipd_description>
