    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to analyze if administration of conestat alfa for 72 hours in
      addition to standard of care (SOC) in patients hospitalized with non-critical SARS-CoV-2
      pneumonia (WHO Ordinal Scale Score 3 or 4) reduces the risk of disease progression to Acute
      Lung Injury (ALI) and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic hyperinflammation is a hallmark of more severe stages of COVID-19 leading to acute
      respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation and ultimately death. In this stage,
      COVID-19 is associated with a decrease in suppressor and regulatory T cell counts and an
      extensive release of proinflammatory cytokines and biomarkers called a cytokine storm, which
      is thought to be the major driver of severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2. C1 esterase
      inhibitor (C1INH) is a member of the serpin superfamily of serine-protease inhibitors and is
      a strong inhibitor of the complement System (CS) and the kinin-kallikrein (KK) System.
      Conestat alfa is a recombinant human C1INH, that shares an identical protein structure with
      plasma-derived C1INH. The rationale of the current trial is based upon the following
      assumptions: In the context of COVID-19, conestat alfa treatment may 1) dampen uncontrolled
      complement activation and collateral lung damage and 2) reduce capillary leakage and
      subsequent pulmonary edema by direct inhibition of KK system. The aim of this study is to
      analyze administration of conestat alfa for 72 hours in addition to standard of care in
      patients hospitalized with non-critical SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia (WHO Ordinal Scale Score 3 or 4)
      and its association with clinical severity on day 7 after inclusion and the risk of disease
      progression to Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
