      Brief Summary:

      The goal here is to evaluate dipyridamole in treating respiratory tract infection and
      circulatory dysfunction due to SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in hospitalized CVID-19 patients.

      Infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes human COVID-19 (HCoV-19). The infection is associated with a
      deleterious inflammatory response and a prothrombotic state in addition to tissue damage from
      direct viral entry and proliferation. Dipyridamole has anti-platelet and anti-inflammatory
      effects. The drug was recently demonstrated to have anti-SARS-Cov-2 effect primarily in
      vitro. The concentration causing anti-viral effect in vitro is within that in the blood of
      humans taking this drug. As an oral tablet, it has the advantage of easy administration.

      Anti thrombotic, anti viral and anti inflammatory actions of this drug may be efficacious and
      safe in hospitalized subjects
