  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre population-based follow-up study for all 504 patients with
      laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This study establishes a standardized and structured clinical
      database to provide complete and multidimensional clinical diagnosis and treatment data of
      novel coronavirus pneumonia, which also support future epidemiological, infectious disease
      study and patients' prognosis, by collecting clinical data and the related data of patients
      with novel coronavirus pneumonia in Southern Zhejiang province.

      The follow-up information will be collected in one-month, three-month, six-month and one-year
      after discharge. Information about symptoms, radiographic and laboratory findings, lung
      function, SF-36 QUESTIONNAIRE, antibody of COVID19ï¼Œresult of RT-PCR Test and suvival
      information will be collected through all time frames.
