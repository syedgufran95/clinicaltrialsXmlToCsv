    <textblock>
      Athletes in martial arts compete in categories separated by body weight, hence, many athletes
      need to adjust their habitual body weight during periods with competition preparation.
      Athletes competing in weight sensitive sports are previously identified with an increased
      risk for symptoms of low energy availability and of disordered eating. The methods used for
      body weight regulation are varied, and athletes without professional competent support, are
      prone to rely on harmful methods. And of importance, female athletes respond more negatively
      to attempts of body weight reduction with regards to health effects.

      Athletes of martial art are not surrounded by the same professional competence seen in other
      organized sports within the international sport federations, and specifically health
      competence is lacking. Additionally, numbers of females competing in martial art have
      increased the last decade, but they still practice in a sport culture dominated by males;
      both with reference to the high number of male participants, and with reference to the
      coaches within this sport. Sports involving practice in intimate, physical interaction with
      coaches or opposing athletes, and in sports where clothing is minimal, may be a high risk of
      experiences of sexual harassment. There have been a few reports on harmful methods of body
      weight regulation within martial arts, however, little knowledge exists on the practice by
      female martial art athletes, and the related health effects. Information on experiences of
      sexual harassment have been sparse in sport generally, with very little knowledge from sports
      like martial arts specifically. This study aims to explore the practice of female martial art
      athletes on body weight regulation, recovery strategies, their body acceptance and symptoms
      of eating disorders, and any experiences of sexual harassment. Additionally, with regards to
      the recent onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, this study also explores the related experiences
      by the athletes on training- and eating routines.

      Low energy availability is a situation triggered by a low energy intake relatively to the
      total energy needs. It may typically occur when energy expenditure is increased by sporting
      activities concurrently to an unconscious or voluntarily insufficient increase in energy
      intake. This may cause a condition called Relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-s),
      indicating a high risk for several negative health effects and performance deterioration.
      Athletes competing in body weight sensitive sports or sports categorized by body weight, have
      been identified with higher prevalence of RED-s, and specifically young females. Although it
      is the total difference between energy needs and energy availability that causes such
      scenario, the methods used to regulate body weight do also matter. Athletes without proper
      guidance on nutritional needs, recovery strategies, and optimal body weight regulation have
      previously reported use of harmful dieting methods, like purging methods, dehydration
      methods, and use of pharmaceuticals. Thus, young females competing in weight sensitive sport,
      not receiving any professional health and performance coaching are at specific risk for
      acutely and longterm negative health effects from chronic or repeated cycles of body weight
      reduction.

      In a rapidly expanding martial arts industry in the US, there have been several reports on
      sexual assault. Still, no systematic and first-hand documentation on this issue has been
      completed. In Norway the same increase in popularity of material arts are noticed, an
      interest also seen among females. With regards to the limited knowledge on exercise practice,
      eating routines and health symptoms in female material art athletes, this study aims to
      expand this. By relying on a cross sectional cohort design with systematic registration of
      outcomes, this study also aim to expand on current limited knowledge on experiences of sexual
      harassment among females in material arts.

      All females aged 16-35 practicing material arts in Oslo (Norway) at the time of recruitment
      (september-december 2020) will be invited (estimated to be between 200-300 athletes). All
      participants will receive information on the aim of this study, and must sign informed
      consent before participation. All data will be measured once per athlete.

    <measure>Low energy availability for females questionnaire (LEAF-Q)</measure>
    <time_frame>Autumn 2020</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluating intensity in symptoms of low energy availability, with one general score, one subscale measuring symptoms of menstrual irregularities, and one subscale measuring symptoms of gastrointestinal dysfunction; the three scales having cut-off scores of ≥8 , ≥4 and ≥2, with higher scorings indicating higher clinical severity.</description>

    <measure>Eating disorder examination questionnaire (EDE-q)</measure>
    <time_frame>Autumn 2020</time_frame>
    <description>Measuring symptoms of eating disorders and frequency of eating disordered behavior, resulting in one total score, and four subscales (figure concern, weight concern, eating concern and eating restriction). A total score of ≥2.5 indicates high probability of having an eating disorder. Additionally, the scales measures frequency of disordered eating behavior, for which ≥1 episode per week of binge-eating and/or ≥1 episode per week of purging behavior, over a total period of ≥3 months, qualifies for an diagnosis of eating disorder.</description>
