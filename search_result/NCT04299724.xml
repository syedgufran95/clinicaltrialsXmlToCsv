  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, viral pneumonia (Covid-19) caused by a novel beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
      broke out in Wuhan, China. Some patients rapidly progressed and suffered severe acute
      respiratory failure and died, making it imperative to develop a safe and effective vaccine to
      treat and prevent severe Covid-19 pneumonia. Based on detailed analysis of the viral genome
      and search for potential immunogenic targets, a synthetic minigene has been engineered based
      on conserved domains of the viral structural proteins and a polyprotein protease. The
      infection of Covid-19 is mediated through binding of the Spike protein to the ACEII receptor,
      and the viral replication depends on molecular mechanisms of all of these viral proteins.
      This trial proposes to develop universal vaccine and test innovative Covid-19 minigenes
      engineered based on multiple viral genes, using an efficient lentiviral vector system
      (NHP/TYF) to express viral proteins and immune modulatory genes to modify artificial antigen
      presenting cells (aAPC) and to activate T cells. In this study, the safety and immune
      reactivity of this aAPC vaccine will be investigated.

      Background:

      The 2019 discovered new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is an enveloped positive strand single
      strand RNA virus. The number of SARS-CoV-2 infected people has increased rapidly and WHO has
      warned that the pandemic spread of Covid-19 is imminent and would have disastrous outcomes.
      Covid-19 could pose a serious threat to human health and the global economy. There is no
      vaccine available or clinically approved antiviral therapy as yet. This study aims to
      evaluate the safety and immune reactivity of a genetically modified aAPC universal vaccine to
      treat and prevent Covid-19.

      Objective:

      Primary study objectives: Injection of Covid-19/aAPC vaccine to volunteers to evaluate the
      safety.

      Secondary study objectives: To evaluate the anti- Covid-19 reactivity of the Covid-19/aAPC
      vaccine.

      Design:

        1. Based on the genomic sequence of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, select conserved and
           critical structural and protease protein domains to engineer lentiviral minigenes to
           express SARS-CoV-2 antigens.

        2. The Covid-19/aAPC vaccine is prepared by applying lentivirus modification including
           immune modulatory genes and the viral minigenes, to the artificial antigen presenting
           cells (aAPCs). The Covid-19/aAPCs are then inactivated for proliferation and extensively
           safety tested.

        3. The subjects receive a total of 5x10^ 6 cells each time by subcutaneous injection at 0,
           14 and 28 days. The subjects are followed-up with peripheral blood tests at 0, 14, 21,
           28 and 60 days until the end of the test.
