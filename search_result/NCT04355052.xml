  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with COVID-19 which are 60 years old or above or with comorbidities are at risk of
      deteriorating and developing severe illness. This prospective open label study will include
      people 60 years old or above or younger if at risk for severe disease. Individuals confirmed
      to have SARS-CoV-2 infection will be identified using medical records screening. They will
      then be offered to participate in the study and if agree will be given the informed consent.
      After examining inclusion and exclusion criteria they will be asked to sign the informed
      consent and after signing Information like immunizations, ECG results, diagnostic images and
      reports, written medical reports, diagnostic lab testing results (e.g. blood tests, urine
      tests, blood bank info), allergies and intolerances (drug and food allergies, food
      intolerances), prescription history, and general patient information (e.g. name, birthdate,
      personal health number, address, phone number) will be gathered. Those who are not eligible
      for the study will be informed of the reason(s) for ineligibility (generally it will be a
      safety exclusion and they should be aware of this). Those who are eligible will be randomized
      to one of three arms: hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine + camostat
      mesylate or &quot;doing nothing&quot; in a ratio of 2:1:2. Study drug will be dispensed by the hospital
      pharmacy. Follow up will continue for 8 weeks.

      This prospective, open-label, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial will determine if
      hydroxychloroquine for 5 days plus camostat mesylate for 10 days, initiated in patients older
      than 60 years or younger but with risk factors for severe COVID 19 disease will reduce the
      risk of progression to severe COVID-19 disease compared to hydroxychloroquine plus
      azithromycin for 5 days or not treating with neither. Severe disease is defined as
      progression to invasive mechanical ventilation, reduced respiratory parameters (according to
      NEWS criteria) and 14 and 30-day mortality. This trial will enroll hospitalized consenting
      adults, who are age 18 or over, have a risk factor for severe disease, have no
      contraindication to treatment with hydroxychloroquine, can swallow pills, and who do not have
      severe underlying comorbidity where treatment is not likely to be beneficial to the patient.

      The primary outcome will be clinical state of the patient according to NEWS scoring on day 7.
      Secondary outcomes will be the proportion of participants requiring invasive mechanical
      ventilation, 14 and 30 -day mortality, and positive viral PCR at day 14.

      Randomization will be stratified by age and sex.
