  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the COVID 19 pandemic and after new cases started to appear in Egypt in march 2020 the
      Egyptian government issued movement restrictions and placed areas into quarantine to reduce
      the spread of the virus. Egyptian citizens were encouraged to adopt personal protective
      measures, such as staying at home , increasing personal hygiene and wearing protective face
      masks. Ramadan is a holy month and a very special event for all the Muslims worldwide
      including the Egyptian Muslims . the Egyptians have many rituals and traditions special for
      Ramadan . normally Egyptian people tend to go to family gatherings and go out for iftar and
      suhoor in Ramadan .the markets also tend to be very crowded and full of people in Ramadan for
      buying food and other preparations for Ramadan and Eid Al Fitr. This all can lead to
      crowdingof people in the streets and markets and increases the chance of the spread of the
      virus and the chance of infection.Public Awareness play a major rule in reducing the spread
      of COVID 19 so in this study a survey is done to measure the attitude of the Egyptian
      population toward COVID 19 in Ramadan and to evaluate if the rituals and traditions in the
      holy month are affecting the spread of COVID 19 in Egypt.
