  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, placebo controlled, interventional phase 2A trial to
      evaluate the safety profile and potential efficacy of multi-dosing of mesenchymal stromal
      cells (MSC) for patients with SARS-CoV-2 associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome
      (ARDS). After informed consent, treatment assignment will be made by computer-generated
      randomization to administer either MSC or vehicle placebo control with a 2:1 allocation to
      the MSC: placebo arm.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MSCs are adult, non-hematopoietic precursor cells derived from a variety of tissues (e.g.,
      bone marrow, adipose tissue, and placenta) and have been used as therapy in multiple
      conditions, especially in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, such as graft versus-host
      disease (GVHD) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with evidence of benefit.

      In preclinical models, MSC are effective in ameliorating acute lung injury due to their
      ability to secrete paracrine factors that regulate lung endothelial and epithelial
      permeability, including growth factors, anti-inflammatory cytokines, and antimicrobial
      peptides. Based on the promising pre-clinical preliminary data and intriguing results in
      patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia and ARDS as well as an established safety profile
      of MSC generally and in ARDS in particular, the researchers propose multiple dosing of MSCs
      as a study treatment to ameliorate the severity and duration of SARS-CoV-2 associated
      pneumonia and ARDS potentially improve survival.

      Patients will receive study agent (MSC or placebo) within 48 hours of enrollment. Three doses
      will be administered unless a severe infusion adverse event occurs that is related to the MSC
      infusion. Doses will be repeated approximately every 48-72 hours with the aim of completing 3
      doses within 7 days of the first dose. All patients will receive standard of care treatments
      for ARDS.

    <masking_description>Patients will be randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either 300 Ã— 10^6 MSC or vehicle placebo control. Randomization will be stratified by risk (high versus standard risk based on the presence of preexisting co-morbidities), using permuted block sizes of 3. The allocation sequence will be accessed by each cell processing laboratory through ONCORE. Personnel in the cell processing laboratories are not masked to the treatment group, but patients, clinical staff, and investigators will be unaware of treatment assignment. To maintain masking of the investigators and clinicians, bags containing the study products and intravenous tubing had opaque coverings applied in the cell laboratories.</masking_description>

          -  History of any significant cardiac (myocardial infarction within 12 months of
             screening visit or unstable angina), chronic ongoing hepatic, or renal disease (grade
