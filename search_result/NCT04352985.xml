      Prospective, observational, clinical investigation of PMX cartridge use in COVID 19 patients
      with septic shock
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a compassionate use protocol for a population of patients with an immediately
      life-threatening condition, for whom no comparable alternative therapy options are available.
      The PMX cartridge will be utilized to treat critically ill patients with septic shock who
      also have COVID 19 virus. The objective will be to observe the efficacy of the PMX cartridge
      with a focus on safety of use in this population.

    <intervention_name>Toraymyxin PMX-20R (PMX Cartridge)</intervention_name>
    <description>The intervention is two (2) treatment sessions of PMX cartridge administration within approximately 24 hours of each other. Each treatment session will target 2 hours with a minimum of 1 ½ hours, at a flow rate of approximately 100 mL/minute, (range of 80 to 120 mL/minute). In cases where the clinical status of the subject is improving, or if the subject suffers from a relapse and the treating physician believes an additional PMX treatment may improve the clinical outcome of the subject, they may administer an additional PMX treatment session (for a total of 3 treatment sessions) at their discretion. All subjects will continue to receive standard medical care for COVID 19 and septic shock.</description>

             immediate return to communicative state

          7. Subject has had an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) within the past 4 weeks

          8. Subject has uncontrolled hemorrhage (acute blood loss requiring &gt; 3 UPC in the past 24
