  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 1/3 of all patients infected with COVID-19 can develop complications that require
      hospitalization. Severe pneumonia associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
      is the most threatening and feared complication of COVID-19 infection, with mortality rates
      close to 50% in some groups.

      Autopsies between these severe cases reveal severe capillary involvement, with signs of
      intense inflammatory changes, microvascular thrombosis, endothelial injury and abnormal
      tissue repair. The available evidence suggests that abnormal activation or imbalance in the
      counter-regulation of the kallikrein-kinin system may play a central role in a positive
      feedback cycle, leading to consequent diffuse microangiopathy. Blockade of the
      kallikrein-kinin system can therefore prevent deterioration of lung function by reducing
      inflammation, edema and microthrombosis.

      The objective of this phase IIb study is to assess the preliminary effects on the oxygenation
      parameters of an antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits pre-kallikrein synthesis in patients
      with moderate to severe COVID-19.

      parameters of an antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits pre-kallikrein synthesis in patients

      This is a blind randomized pilot clinical study which aims to include 90 patients (45 per

    <masking_description>The placebo used in the present study will consist of 0.9% NaCl Solution, which has the same physical characteristics as the ISIS 721744 drug. The placebo solution will be prepared by the nurse or pharmacist of the research team at the time of application. The nurse will be trained on the procedures for adequate blinding of the intervention. The pharmacist at the site level will not be blind, but the rest of the ream (nurse, physicians, patients, etc) will be blinded.</masking_description>
