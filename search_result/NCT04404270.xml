  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In mid-February 2020, within the Oise (France) cluster, a case of COVID-19 disease caused by
      a SARS-CoV2 infection was described among the personnel of the Creail Air Force Base (BA110).
      This resulted in the beginning of an epidemic controlled by epidemiological measures. One
      month later, containment measures were taken at the national level, measures that also
      applied to BA110 personnel. These personnel, exposed to both the initial phase of the
      epidemic and national protection measures, represent an extremely interesting population for
      understanding the epidemiological dynamics of the virus, particularly at a time when France
      is lifting the containment measures. It becomes extremely important to understand the levers
      of viral spread in order to adjust the health measures to be maintained as best as possible.

      The main objective of this study is to determine the extent of virus diffusion in this highly
      circulating population, as evidenced by several identified cases of COVID-19.

    <description>The percentage of the study population with positive serological status will be determined. ELISA serology test will be used to detect anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies (IgG and IgM) at Day 0</description>

    <description>Epidemiological data will be collected in a questionnaire that will be filled by participants at Day 0 (Visit 1), after 3 months (Visit 2) and after 9 months (Visit 3).
The questionnaire includes:
medical data (height, weight, smoking, history of intense stress);
socio-demographic data (age, gender, civil/military status, function/occupation, rank category, army, family status/home composition, housing conditions, etc.);
clinical data : history of symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 in the last 3 months, current symptoms suggestive of COVID-19;
use of care, hospitalization, work stoppage in the last 3 months;
contact with people who are symptomatic or proven COVID-19.</description>
