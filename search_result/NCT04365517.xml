  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pathology is frequently associated with diabetes mellitus and metabolic
      syndrome. In the epidemic outbreak that exploded at the beginning of 2020 in the Lombardy
      Region, about two thirds of the patients who died from COVID-19 were affected by diabetes
      mellitus. COVID-19 occurs in 70% of cases with an inflammatory pathology of the airways that
      can be fed by a cytokine storm and result in severe respiratory failure (10% cases) and death
      (5%). The pathophysiological molecular mechanisms are currently not clearly defined. It is
      hypothesized that the transmembrane glycoprotein type II CD26, known for the enzyme activity
      Dipeptilpeptidase 4 of the extracellular domain, may play a main role in this condition. It
      is in fact considerably expressed at the level of parenchyma and pulmonary interstitium and
      carries out both systemic and paracrine enzymatic activity, modulating the function of
      various proinflammatory cytokines, growth factors and vasoactive peptides in the deep
      respiratory tract. Of particular interest is the fact that Dipeptilpeptidase 4 has been
      identified as a cellular receptor for S glycoprotein of MERS-COV. In the case of the SARS-COV
      2 virus, the main receptor is the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 protein, but a possible
      interaction with Dipeptilpeptidase 4 also cannot be excluded. The selective blockade of
      Dipeptilpeptidase 4 could therefore favorably modulate the pulmonary inflammatory response in
      the subject affected by COVID-19. This protein is also known for the enzymatic degradation
      function of the native glucagon-like peptide 1, one of the main regulators of insulin
      secretion. This is why it is a molecular target in the treatment of diabetes (drugs that
      selectively inhibit Dipeptilpeptidase 4 are marketed with an indication for the treatment of
      type 2 diabetes). It is believed that the use of a Dipeptilpeptidase 4 inhibitor in people
      with diabetes and hospitalized for Covid-19 may be safe and of particular interest for an
      evaluation of the effects on laboratory and instrumental indicators of inflammatory lung
      disease. Among the drugs that selectively block Dipeptilpeptidase 4, the one with the
      greatest affinity is Sitagliptin.

      The investigators propose a randomized controlled open label intervention study. Patients
      hospitalized for COVID-19 and affected by type 2 diabetes mellitus will be included in the
      study and divided into two groups by randomization: sitagliptin add-on standard of care
      therapy with nutritional therapy with or without insulin treatment (study group) vs
      nutritional therapy with or without insulin treatment (group of control, standard therapy).
      The design of the study provides an open randomization to allow its feasibility in times
      compatible with the achievement of adequate cases during the epidemic. The presence of
      placebo and a double-blind study, would lead to longer planning and enrollment times.

      Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus hospitalized for COVID-19 and randomized to the study
      group will be treated with sitagliptin at an adjusted dosage for estimated glomerular
      filtrate: 100 mg once daily (estimated glomerular filtration rate less than or equal to 45 mL
      / min / 1.73 m2) or 50 mg (estimated glomerular filtration rate 30-45 mL / min / 1.73 m2) in
      combination or not with insulin treatment. Patients with stage IV and V renal impairment
      (estimated glomerular filtration rate less than or equal to 30 mL / min / 1.73 m2) will be
      excluded. Enrolled patients will be followed according to the following scheme:

      Time points:

        -  T0: The doctor explains the protocol to the patient and he gives to him the informed
           consent and the letter to the general practitioner.

        -  T1: The patient gives the signed and dated consent and officially enters the study.
           Basic assessments will be made. At the baseline, the clinical response, the main
           laboratory and instrumental tests will be taken into consideration. Biological samples
           will be taken for immunological study. Diabetic patients will begin treatment with
           Sitagliptin 100 or 50 mg add-on to nutritional therapy and, eventually, insulin
           treatment. Any other hypoglycemic agents taken before admission will be suspended.

        -  T2: 7 days after T1, for both groups of patients, evaluation of the clinical response,
           of the average daily blood glucose levels, of the main laboratory and instrumental
           tests.

        -  T3: 10 days after T2, for both groups of patients, evaluation of clinical response,
           average daily blood glucose levels, of the main laboratory and instrumental tests.
           Collection of biological samples for immunological study. End of the study.
