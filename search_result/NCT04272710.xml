  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, the outbreak of the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection in Wuhan and Hubei
      provinces has attracted great attention from the medical community across the country. Both
      2019-nCoV and SARS viruses are coronaviruses, and they have a large homology.

      Published laboratory studies have suggested that SARS virus infection and its lung injury are
      related to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in lung tissue. And ACE and ACE2 in the
      renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are vital central links to maintain hemodynamic stability and
      normal heart and kidney function in vivo.

      A large amount of evidence-based medical evidence shows that ACE inhibitors are the basic
      therapeutic drugs for maintaining hypertension, reducing the risk of cardiovascular,
      cerebrovascular, and renal adverse events, improving quality of life, and prolonging life in
      patients with hypertension. Recent experimental studies suggest that treatment with ACE
      inhibitors can significantly reduce pulmonary inflammation and cytokine release caused by
      coronavirus infection.
