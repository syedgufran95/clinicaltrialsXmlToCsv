  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this protocol, we seek to examine the role of social media in information spread during a
      pandemic. As there have been few pandemics in the last decade (coinciding with the rise of
      social media), its use in this context remains understudied. This study hence intends to: (1)
      characterize the nature of social media use, (2) understand the impact of social media use,
      and (3) understand how to communicate accurate information.
