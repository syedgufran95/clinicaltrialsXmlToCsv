      Prospective registry for multimodal assessment of neuromuscular pathology associated with
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, enrolling consecutive
      patients with corona virus disease 2019 (Covid-19), who are admitted to the intensive care
      unit of the department of anesthesiology and intensive care medicine, or the department of
      neurology at Tübingen University Hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prospective registry shall provide new insights into muscular involvement associated with
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. For that reason
      consecutive patients with proven corona virus disease 2019 (Covid-19), who are admitted to
      the intensive care unit of the department of anesthesiology and intensive care medicine, or
      the department of neurology at Tübingen University Hospital, are enrolled. Multimodal
      assessment of neuromuscular pathology is based on medical history, laboratory biomarkers
      including inflammation parameters and autoimmune antibodies, vital parameters monitoring,
      muscle ultrasound, transthoracic echocardiography, electroneurography, as well as
      electromyography. Inclusion of follow-up visits permit longitudinal and prognostic evaluation
      of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions (e.g. immunomodulation with immunoglobulins,
      corticosteroids, or interleukin 6 receptor antagonists).
