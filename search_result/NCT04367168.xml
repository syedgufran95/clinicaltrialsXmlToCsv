  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The world is currently facing a pandemic due to the outbreak of a new coronavirus causing
      acute respiratory failure called SARS-Cov2. The majority of patients (8 out of 10) are known
      to have mild disease, manifested by respiratory tract symptoms associated with fever,
      headache, and body pain. However, it is possible that the disease progresses to a severe
      stage, whith the need for mechanical ventilation support associated with high morbidity and
      mortality. The progression of the disease is mainly due to the appearance of uncontrolled
      inflammation that also favors the development of disseminated clots. So far, there is no
      effective treatment to combat coronavirus; however, the use of anti-inflammatory drugs is
      potentially effective in preventing complications from the disease. In this regard, low dose
      colchicine is relatively safe and effective as an anti-inflammatory. It has been used for
      many years in the control of inflammation secondary to the accumulation of uric acid
      crystals. The aim of this study is to test if the administration of colchicine at a dose of
      1.5 mg the first day and subsequently 0.5 mg BID until completing 10 days of treatment is
      effective as a treatment for inflammation related symptoms in patients with mild and severe
      disease secondary to coronavirus infection. The primary outcome is improvement of symptoms
      related to inflammation and avoiding progression to severe and critical stages of the
      disease. Colchicine can be discontinued before the end of 10 days in case of serious adverse
      effects or if the patient progresses to the critical stages of the disease.

      This a placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial to test the efficacy and security of
      colchicine 1.5 mg at day one followed by 0.5 mg BID to complete 10 days of treatment. The
      researchers will recruit patients 18-70 years of age who are hospitalized because of the
      diagnosis of mild or severe COVID-19. Patients will be randomized to receive one of the
      treatment arms, colchicine or placebo. The aim of the study is to evaluate if colchicine may
      be able to improve the outcomes in patients with mild and severe COVID-19. Patients will be
      followed-up during the entire hospitalization time and during convalescence. The importance
      of this intervention is highlighted because currently, there is not an effective treatment
      for the virus, nor for the prevention of the cytokine storm or the disseminated intravascular
      coagulation. Therefore, an early intervention to prevent the development of these
      complications would be valuable to prevent the morbi-morbidity secondary to severe and
      critical COVID-19
