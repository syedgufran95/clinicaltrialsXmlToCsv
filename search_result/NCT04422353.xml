      The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of video dance class and unsupervised physical
      activity on clinical-functional parameters, self-isolation and non-motors symptoms in people
      with Parkinson's disease during the Covid-19 pandemic.

      Experimental Design: an interventional study. Search Location: Exercise Research Laboratory
      at the School of Physical Education, Physiotherapy and Dance, Federal University of Rio
      Grande do Sul, and in the Movement Disorders Outpatient Clinic of the Hospital of Clinicals
      of Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Participants: 60 participants from
      the Dance, the Nordic Walking, and the Aquatic Jogging extension projects at Federal
      University of Rio Grande do Sul, both sexes, from 50 to 80 years old, diagnosed with
      idiopathic PD, will be separate in three groups: Video Dance Classes, in the unsupervised
      physical activity, and in the control group. Interventions: video dance class, unsupervised
      physical activity, and a control group. The video dance class program will have a frequency
      of two sessions per week and a duration of 30 minutes for 12 weeks. The unsupervised physical
      activity receives an unsupervised home exercise program with a frequency of two sessions per
      week and a duration of 30 minutes for 12 weeks during the Covid-19 pandemic.

      The control group will be people with PD, engaged, before the Covid-19 pandemic, in the
      Dance, the Nordic Walk and the Aquatic Jogging extension projects at Federal University of
      Rio Grande do Sul but did not do any type of physical activity during the Covid-19 pandemic.

      To evaluate the impacts of the activities during the Covid-19 pandemic, evaluations will be
      performed by telephone after 60 days of social distance and self-isolation. Outcomes:
      clinical-functional parameters and non-motor parameters. Data Analysis: Data will be
      described by average values and standard deviation values. The comparisons between groups
      will be performed using a Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) analysis, adopting a level
      of significance (α) of 0.05. Expected Results: Participants who have remained committed with
      the video dance class or with the unsupervised physical activity during the Covid-19 pandemic
      expected to be less affected in the analyzed outcomes, especially in Quality of Life, when
      compared to the control group. In addition, it is expected that the research results could
      help to future developments in the scientific, technological, economic, social, and
      environmental fields.

    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of life (QoL) will be measured by the Parkinson's Disease Quality of life (PDQ-8). PDQ-8 is a reduced version of a specific health status questionnaire comprising 39 items, with 8 items. Respondents are requested to affirm one of five ordered response categories according to how often, due to their PD, they have experienced the problem defined by each item. Each item is grouped into eight scales that are scored by expressing summed item scores as a percentage score ranging between 0 and 100 (100¼more health problems).</description>

    <measure>Depressive symptoms - Geriatric Depression Scale - 15 item</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be measure for the Geriatric Depression Scale - 15 item. The scale consists of 15 dichotomous questions in which participants are asked to answer yes or no about how they felt over the past week (for instance, &quot;Do the patient feel that their life is empty?,&quot; Do the patient feel that their situation is hopeless?). Scores range from 0 to 15 with higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Physical Activity - International Physical Activity Questionnaires (IPAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be measure for the International Physical Activity Questionnaires (IPAQ). The IPAQ comprises a set of 4 questionnaires. Long (5 activity domains asked independently) and short (4 generic items) versions for use by either telephone or self-administered methods are available. The purpose of the questionnaires is to provide common instruments that can be used to obtain internationally comparable data on health-related physical activity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive function - Montreal Cognitive Assessment by telephone</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a brief screening tool for mild cognitive impairment. This evaluation accesses different cognitive domains and investigates the individual's abilities in the following areas: attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructive skills, conceptualization, calculation, and orientation. The total score of the MoCA is 30 points, with a score of 26, or more, considered normal and less than 26 is considered a cognitive impairment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Falls - Falls Efficacy Scale - International</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be measure for the Falls - Falls Efficacy Scale - International (FES-I). FES-I can be administered as self-completion questionnaires, or administered verbally as part of a research interview or clinical assessment. To calculate the FES-I score when all items are completed, simply add the scores for each item together to give a total that ranges as follows: minimum 16 (no concern about falling) to maximum 64 (severe concern about falling).</description>

    <description>The dance program consists of dance lessons inspired by Forró rhythm and Samba rhythm.
Classes will be divided into four stages: Joint warm-up and stretching on the chairs; strengthening, balance, and rhythm exercises with the support of the chair; exercises inspired by the samba and forró (Brazilian ballroom dance) basic steps; and Final cool down. The classes will be held through a recorded video that must be played twice a week. Each video class lasts 30 minutes.
