  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of physical rehabilitation performed
      in intensive care unit on the range of joint motions and muscle strength of survivors
      following discharge from intensive care unit in patients with COVID-19. Secondary outcome is
      to assess the duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in intensive care unit and
      in hospital, and mortality rates during intensive care unit stay and health related quality
      of life following discharge in survivors.

      Until April 14 patients were provided all the intensive care managements except for
      rehabilitation and patients discharged before this time constituted the 'non-rehabilitation'
      group (n=17). Patients discharged after April 14 were provided rehabilitation in addition to
      usual intensive care unit care and constituted the study 'rehabilitation' group (n=18).

      Passive range of motion exercises to each joint and neuromuscular electrical stimulation to
      bilateral quadriceps and tibialis anterior muscles were applied 6 days/week in the
      'rehabilitation' group during intensive care unit stay.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome could develop muscle weakness associated
      with impairment of physical function defined as intensive care unit acquired weakness. Early
      rehabilitation is recommended to prevent complications including muscle weakness and joint
      contractures, enhance weaning from mechanical ventilation, improve outcome, quality of life.

      COVID-19 is an acute infection with a high risk of enormous cytokine storm exacerbating the
      clinical condition in acute respiratory distress syndrome and is thought to further increase
      the risk of muscle weakness.

      Study participants were recruited among patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit at
      Koc University Hospital. Standard care for these patients consisted of respiratory support,
      intravenous fluid therapy, medical treatment including anticoagulation and sedation,
      nutrition, change of position every 4 hours, and if needed, hemodynamic support. The
      non-rehabilitation group patients discharged before April 14, 2020, were provided with this
      standard care. The rehabilitation group patients that discharged after April 14, 2020, were
      provided rehabilitation in addition to usual standard care. The rehabilitation program
      consisted of a passive range of motion exercises for each joint of the extremities for 15
      minutes/day, 6 days/week, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation to bilateral quadriceps
      and tibialis anterior muscles for 52 minutes/day, 6 days/week. The physiatrists evaluated the
      patients. Exercises and electrical stimulation were applied daily by physiotherapists. The
      physiatrist and anesthesiologist discussed the clinical status of the patients daily and the
      physiatrist modified the rehabilitation program, if needed. Patients were enrolled in the
      rehabilitation program if there is hemodynamical stability.

      Information regarding demographic and clinical features, medications used, duration of
      mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital, and mortality
      were obtained from the digital patient records in both groups.

      Following discharge, patients were evaluated for range of joint motion, manual muscle
      strength test, hand grip strength and Short form-36.

    <measure>Hand grip strength</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month after discharge from hospital</time_frame>
    <description>Hand grip strength is an indicator of overall muscle strength that predicts mortality in older patients. Handgrip strength was measured using a handheld dynamometer according to the instructions of the American Society of Hand Therapists.Patients were seated placing their arms by their sides with the elbow flexed to 90°, the forearm mid-prone, and the wrist in neutral position. Patients were asked to grip the dynamometer with maximal effort using standard verbal encouragement. Three trials were performed in the dominant hand with a 30 sec rest between trials and the highest value was recorded in kg. The cut-off values of grip strength is 28.6 kg in men and 16.4 kg in women. The measurement was performed 1 month after discharge.</description>

    <measure>Short form - 36</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month after discharge from hospital</time_frame>
    <description>Short form - 36 measures health related quality of life. It is a self-reported survey that evaluates individual health status with eight parameters consisting of physical function, pain, role limitations attributed to physical problems, role limitations attributed to emotional problems, mental health, social functioning, energy/ vitality, general health perception. There is not a summary score, each section is scored between 0-100, 0 indicates the worst condition, 100 indicates the best. The measurement was performed 1 month after discharge.</description>

    <measure>Manual muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month after discharge from hospital</time_frame>
    <description>Manual muscle strength was graded via a composite of Medical Research Council Scale score which has an excellent inter-rater reliability in survivors of critical illness. This scale range from 0 point (no muscle contraction) to 5 points (normal muscle strength). Through examination of 3 muscle groups in each limb (arm abduction, forearm flexion, wrist extension, hip flexion, knee extension and ankle dorsiflexion), clinical important muscle weakness has been defined as a composite score &lt; 48 out of maximum 60 points. The measurement was performed 1 month after discharge.</description>

        The patients that hospitalized due to acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to
        COVID-19 were enrolled this study. The rehabilitation program was started at April 14, 2020
        in intensive care unit. Until April 14, 2020 all patients were provided all the intensive
        care managements, except for rehabilitation. Therefore, patients discharged before this
        time constituted the 'non-rehabilitation' group of the present study. All patients
        discharged after April 14 were provided rehabilitation in addition to usual care and
        constituted the study 'rehabilitation' group
