  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this program is to see if giving convalescent plasma to individuals who test
      positive for COVID-19 may reduce their symptoms and help minimize complications from the
      illness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As individuals are exposed to pathogens, the body's immune system works to create antibodies
      toward those pathogens. These antibodies can be found in the plasma portion of the blood.
      This plasma is referred to as &quot;Convalescent plasma&quot; and contains these infection fighting
      antibodies. Through a blood donation, this convalescent plasma is collected from a recovered
      person and transfused to a sick patient who is still fighting the same virus. This protocol
      will make convalescent COVID-19 plasma available to individuals who meet the eligibility
      criteria described.

             goals of care (i.e. recipient cannot be DNI status)

          -  Laboratory confirmed diagnosis of infection with SARS-CoV-2 that is severe or life
             threatening OR the individual is judged by the treating provider to be at a high risk
             of progression to severe or life-threatening disease.

          -  Severe COVID-19 is defined by one or more of the following:

               2. Respiratory frequency ≥ 30/min

               3. Blood oxygen saturation ≤ 93%

               4. Partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio &lt; 300

               5. Lung infiltrates &gt; 50% within 24-48 hours

          -  Life-threatening COVID-19 is defined as one or more of the following:

               1. Respiratory failure

               3. Multiple organ dysfunction or failure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of prior life-threatening reactions to transfusion of blood products

          -  Not receiving other therapies that would preclude plasma transfusion
