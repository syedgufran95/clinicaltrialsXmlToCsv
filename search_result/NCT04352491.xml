  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has been marked by severe psychological problems.
      People around the world experienced a similarly frightening public health emergency, on a
      global scale, with the spread of this corona infection. (1) Studies of the Severe Acute
      Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreaks that occurred in Canada, Taiwan, and Hong Kong found
      that the enormous emotional burden carried by those health care workers who were on the front
      lines of the battle against the disease led to psychological morbidity like anxiety, stress
      and even further leads to Post traumatic stress disorder. The initial phase of the COVID-19
      outbreak in China in 2020 also reported more than half of the respondents rated the
      psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe
      anxiety in general population.(2)

      - The chances of Fear, anxiety and stress are even higher in Individuals with preexisting
      liver disease as they have restriction of services for getting treatment. Moreover, they can
      have the following additional issues:

        -  Fear of severe form of Corona present (as presented in most of the media and research)

        -  Fear of dying

        -  Added uncertainty

        -  Family members also worried

      -  As the Indian Government recommended the public to minimize face-to-face interaction and
           isolate them at home, potential respondents will be invited through a text message which
           will lead to a survey monkey page (designed by IT team at ILBS, New Delhi).

        -  All people who have shown at ILBS (1st January 2018 - 31st March 2020), will be sent the
           SMS for participation. They will be asked to provide phone numbers for retrieval of
           their Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) and Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores from
           hospital records. Patients with education more than 10th standard (or able to understand
           / read English) will only proceed with the survey.

        -  After clicking the link users will complete an online survey. The first page will give
           them basic information about the FEELIV-COVID survey and if they consent to participate,
           they will complete the survey. The decision to undertake the survey voluntarily, and
           will have no impact on their ongoing treatment.

        -  Informed consent will be obtained in the form of electronic name entry at the beginning
           of the survey. Their name entry will be taken as an approval to allow the investigators
           data regarding their Liver disease. Only the following data will be taken from the
           patient's records:

             -  Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score

             -  Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score

             -  Etiology of Liver Dysfunction

        -  No other data will be retrieved for the purpose of this study from patient's records.

    <description>Following questionnaire will be used For Fear of COVID-19: FEAR OF COVID-19 Scale Fear of Coronavirus-19 Scale: The participants indicate their level of agreement with the statements using a five-item Likert-type scale. Answers included &quot;strongly disagree,&quot; &quot;disagree,&quot; &quot;neither agree nor disagree,&quot; &quot;agree,&quot; and &quot;strongly agree&quot;. The minimum score possible for each question is 1, and the maximum is 5. A total score is calculated by adding up each item score (ranging from 7 to 35). The higher the score, the greater the fear of cororonavirus-19.</description>

    <description>Following questionnaire will be used
o For, anxiety: DASS - 21 Scale Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 Items (DASS-21) Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS)-21: The DASS-21 is based on three subscales of depression, stress, and anxiety and each subscale consists of seven questions each. Each subscale comprises of seven statements regarding how the test subject was feeling over the last week and four responses ranging from 0- did not apply to me at all, 1- applied to me some of the time, 2- applied to me for a considerable amount of time to 3- applied to me very much/most of the time. The scoring system is of the Likert type and the total score for each subscale gives the severity of that very symptom which has a range from 0 to 21 for each subscale.</description>
