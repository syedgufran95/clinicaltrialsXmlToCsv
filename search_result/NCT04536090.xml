  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, multi-centre pilot study where hospitalized subjects will
      be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive Isoquercetin (IQC-950AN) in addition to standard of
      care or standard of care only for 28 days following confirmation of a COVID-19 infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this randomized study will be to evaluate the effect of Isoquercetin
      (IQC-950AN) treatment on the reduction of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
      viral titers. The secondary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of Isoquercetin
      (IQC-950AN) treatment on the progression of COVID-19 disease in these subjects and their
      recovery. In addition, certain parameters which may help elucidate the mechanism of action
      (sLDLR, PCSK9, sACE2, D-dimers and CRP) will be followed. The safety of Isoquercetin
      (IQC-950AN) will be evaluated at each visit. Subjects will be randomized to receive treatment
      for 28 days and then will return 30 days following the discontinuation of treatment for a
      final safety visit.

      The results of this study will be used to design an adequately powered randomized controlled
      pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Isoquercetin (IQC-950AN) in all or a
      subset of subjects with confirmed COVID-19.
