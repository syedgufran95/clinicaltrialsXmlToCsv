  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One-in-four patients with COVID-19 pneumonia develop life-threatening heart problems. Through
      cardiovascular imaging and biomarkers analyses this study aims to evaluate whether COVID-19
      infection results in heart injury. The investigators will also investigate which patients are
      at risk of heart injury as a result of COVID-19 and why only some patients suffer heart
      problems as a consequence of the infection. The study will also assess multisystem
      involvement including the lungs and kidneys.

      Our study is supported through the Chief Scientist Office Rapid Research in Covid-19
      (RARC-19) programme. Our study will clarify the pathogenesis of cardiopulmonary injury,
      notably endotypes of myocardial injury including myocarditis, in patients with COVID-19.

      The study involves a prospective, observational, multicentre, longitudinal cohort design.The
      investigators aim to minimise selection bias by adopting consecutive screening of all-comers
      hospitalised with COVID-19 and the eligibility criteria are broad. For example, severe renal
      dysfunction is not an exclusion criterion. The sample size is 180 patients enrolled at
      baseline with 160 attending for the primary outcome evaluation (cardiac imaging) at 28 days
      post-discharge. The investigators will use advanced cardiovascular imaging to identify the
      number (proportion) of patients with myocardial inflammation (myocarditis) that is
      sub-clinical (i.e. not diagnosed) or clinically overt. Cardiovascular MRI and CT coronary
      angiography will provide a comprehensive examination one month after discharge is intended to
      detect persisting cardiovascular complications and diagnose clinical endotypes. The
      investigators aim to clarify the pathological significance of serial changes in circulating
      troponin, NTproBNP and renal function. By correlating the MRI findings with troponin I and
      other measures of cardiovascular injury, such as NTproBNP, our results will inform care
      pathways that use these blood tests to guide the management of patients with COVID-19.
      Correlation of imaging findings with baseline clinical information, biomarkers, patient
      reported outcome measures and well-being in the longer term will help to clarify the clinical
      significance of cardiovascular complications in COVID-19. Since the design is observational,
      an interim analysis may be undertaken with the timing informed by the enrolment rate.

    <measure>The primary cardiac outcome is the proportion of patients with a diagnosis of myocardial inflammation (myocarditis).</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days after discharge from hospital</time_frame>
    <description>Myocardial inflammation (or myocarditis) will be revealed by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) according to contemporary guidelines including the modified Lake Louise Criteria. The endotypes of myocardial injury are 1) myocardial inflammation due to 1.1) viral myocarditis, 1.2) ischaemia, or 1.3) stress (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy, 2) myocardial infarction, 3) indeterminate, or 4) none. The final diagnosis will be a consensus-based determination by an expert panel. This information will provide insights into the incidence, nature, time-course and clinical significance of cardiovascular involvement in patients with COVID-19. The clinical significance of our findings will be assessed through associations with patient reported outcome measures (PROMS) and health outcomes in the longer term.</description>
