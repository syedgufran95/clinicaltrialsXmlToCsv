  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID19-associated disease may have different clinical aspects classified in 3 stages. Some
      patients initially presenting with a non-hypoxemic viral pneumonia (stage 2a) may evolve
      toward a more severe stage 2b or 3 (acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS) around the 7th
      or 10th day of evolution, with a severe biological inflammatory syndrome (CRP&gt;200 mg/l), and
      some times more severe complications such as acute renal insufficiency, consumptive
      coagulopathy or shock, requiring increasing oxygen therapy, ICU admission, invasive
      mechanical ventilation and possibly leading to death. This detrimental evolution is due to a
      host-derived &quot;cytokine storm&quot; with a great excess of circulating inflammatory cytokines. In
      animal models of ARDS complicating coronavirus or influenza virus infection, the cytokine
      storm has been linked to hyperactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. NLRP3 constitutes an
      intracellular protein platform which is responsible for caspase1 activation and processing of
      interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18 . IL-1b is a major proinflammatory cytokine which induces
      IL-6, whereas IL-18 is an inducer of interferon gamma (IFNg) production by Th-1 lymphocytes.
      A blood IL-1/IL-6 signature can be defined by increased neutrophilia and CRP concentrations,
      whereas an IL-18/IFNg signature is characterized by severe hyperferritinemia, consumptive
      coagulopathy and cytopenia. A majority of patients with COVID-19 infections seems to have an
      IL-1/IL-6 signature, evolving in the more severe forms toward an IL-18/IFNg signature,
      mimicking cytokine profiles observed in other inflammatory diseases such as Still's disease
      or hemophagocytic syndromes. In Still's disease, therapeutic inhibition of IL-1 or IL-6 has
      proven to be very efficient strategies. During hemophagocytic syndromes, inhibition of IFNg
      is effective in humans notably through blockade of its receptor signalization, using the JAK
      kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib.

      Following this strategy, we propose to use biological drugs currently available for
      inhibition of IL-1 (anakinra), IL-6 (tocilizumab) or IFNg signaling (ruxolitinib) in the
      severe forms of COVID19-associated disease. Our hypothesis is that IL-1, IL-6 or JAK kinase
      inhibition will allow:

        1. to prevent stage 2b worsening and the need to be admitted in ICU, by decreasing
           oxygen-requirement and systemic inflammation

        2. to improve stage 3 and extremely severe stage 3, allowing invasive mechanical
           ventilation weaning, improving multi-system organ dysfunction, leading to a faster ICU
           exit.

      We propose an open randomized therapeutic trial (1/1/1) on 216 patients with severe stage 2b
      and 3 of the disease
