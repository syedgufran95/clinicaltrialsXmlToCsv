  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients requiring intensive care suffer to a large extent from cognitive
      deficits involving higher brain functions that primarily affect memory, learning and the
      ability to concentrate. While the background to this effect is not fully understood, there
      are growing evidence to support mechanisms related to neuro inflammation and changes in blood
      flow with concomitant ischemic brain damage. Patients with covid-19 often suffer from severe
      inflammatory activity with an increased risk of coagulation abnormalities and brain damage.
      Covid-19 patients requiring intensive care develope more severe impairment of neurological
      and cognitive function than critically ill intensive care patients who have not covid-19.
      This project therefore aims to map the link between inflammation, immunology and coagulation
      systems as well as biochemical and structural changes in the brain with cognitive effects in
      patients in intensive care for covid-19.
