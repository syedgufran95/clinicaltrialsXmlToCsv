  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our project intends to independently develop a fully enclosed rapid detection system for a
      total of 22 pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, on the basis of the QIAstat-Dx fully automatic
      multiple PCR detection platform. The reasonably designed experiments are used to verify the
      performance of the cartridge detection and prove its clinical application value. The 22
      pathogens tested in this project includes 4 coronavirus subtypes, A / B flu, parainfluenza
      virus, respiratory syncytial virus, etc., which is of great significance for the differential
      diagnosis of similar patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 has not been well suppressed, and became a pandemic within 3 months globally is
      mainly because of the virus characteristic in the following aspects:

        1. Long incubation period (average 5-7 days, up to 28 days), and the incubation period is
           contagious

        2. Strong transmissibility, virus can be transmitted through aerosol

        3. Difficulty distinguishing infected patients from other pathogenic infections

        4. High negative rate of nucleic acid detection in upper respiratory tract samples of
           infected patients, which increases the difficulty of differential diagnosis of infection
           with other pathogens The existing RT-PCR nucleic acid detection kits for SARS-CoV-2 has
           two major problems. First, the procedure is not automated leading to higher requirements
           for personnel operation level and environment sterilize. What's more the kits are
           SARS-CoV-2 only. Once the test result is negative, it cannot help diagnose the exact
           pathogen in one time of experiment.

      Therefore, this project intends to independently develop a fully enclosed rapid detection
      system for a total of 22 pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, on the basis of the QIAstat-Dx
      fully automatic multiple PCR detection platform. The reasonably designed experiments are used
      to verify the performance of the cartridge detection and prove its clinical application
      value. The 22 pathogens tested in this project includes 4 coronavirus subtypes, A / B flu,
      parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, etc., which is of great significance for
      the differential diagnosis of similar patients.
