  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research aims to improve our knowledge of the epidemiology of patients consulting in the
      COvid-19 Possible REspiratory Units (RECOP unit). Indeed, the epidemic linked to COVID-19
      affects France and impacts its health system. The reception of all intermediate patients will
      be on the Emergency Structures (SU). Indeed, the French healthcare system centralizes
      unscheduled urgent care on the ER. The aspecific respiratory symptomatology in &quot;intermediate&quot;
      patients indicates them all the more at an admission to SU or the diagnostic approach to
      respiratory difficulty may be carried out.

      A central issue of this diagnostic strategy will be to be rapid, since the diagnosis will
      have to be made in the context of significant flows, with a need to quickly refer patients to
      the most suitable downstream service, while limiting the risk contamination of caregivers and
      vulnerable patients if a COVID-19 + patient is admitted to an unsuitable service. However,
      virological tests do not currently allow rapid results for COVID-19.

      Research project of investigatory aims to develop a predictive model of the risk of being
      COVID-19 positive for patients admitted to the emergency room for acute dyspnea.
