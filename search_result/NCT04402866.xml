    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent on their own prior to performing
             study procedures. In the U.K., subject assent or proxy consent as per local site
             procedures, may also be acceptable if both a clinician and second health professional
             attest that the subject understands the risks and potential benefits of the study and
             elects to proceed. Outside the U.K., written informed consent may only be obtained
             from the subject or legally authorized representative. In the event the subject loses
             capacity during the study, the subject consents to continued participation, except
             where this is not clinically indicated.

          -  Willing and able to comply with study-related procedures/assessments

          -  Age 18 to 80 years old

          -  Hospitalized (or documentation of a plan to admit to the hospital if the subject is in
             an emergency department) and requiring supplemental oxygen to maintain saturation &gt;
             90%

          -  Confirmed symptomatic COVID-19. If testing results are not immediately available,
             strong clinical suspicion of COVID-19 can be used for inclusion. Testing should still
             be done in these subjects. Strong clinical suspicion includes:

          -  At least 2 of the following:

               -  Fever

               -  Cough

               -  Fatigue

               -  Dyspnea;

               -  and At least 1 of the following

                    -  Radiographic evidence of viral pneumonia

                    -  Close contact with a patient who has previously tested positive for COVID-19

          -  Onset of COVID-19 -related symptoms &gt; 2 days and &lt;/= 10 days prior to hospital
             admission

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects currently receiving mechanical ventilation or non-invasive positive-pressure
             ventilation, or subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, will require
             ventilatory support (i.e., mechanical ventilation or non-invasive positive-pressure
             ventilation) within the next 12 hours. Signs of impending need for ventilatory support
             include prolonged respiratory rate (i.e., &gt;30 breaths per minute), signs of
             respiratory muscle fatigue, or paradoxical diaphragm.

          -  Presence or suspicion of active malignancy with the exception of cancer in situ (e.g.,
             skin cancer)

          -  Evidence of serious active infection other than COVID-19

          -  Current diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B or C

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, unlikely to survive for &gt; 24 hours from enrollment

          -  Women who are pregnant or might be pregnant, or who are currently breast-feeding.

          -  Presence of significant comorbidity that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             predisposes the subject to mortality. Such conditions might include: a. New York Heart
             Association class IV Heart Failure b. Hepatic dysfunction (i.e., AST or ALT &gt;3x upper

             (eGFR) &lt; 50mL/min) or receiving renal replacement therapy

          -  Presence of septic shock at time of enrollment

          -  Hemoglobin &lt; 80 g/L

             (i.e., absolute lymphocyte count &lt; 200 cells/uL) or thrombocytopenia (i.e.Platelets &lt;
             50×10^9/uL)

          -  Hypersensitivity to TD-0903 or its components, or to other JAK inhibitors

          -  Treatment with anti-IL 6, anti-IL-6R antagonists, or with JAK inhibitors in the past

             enrollment b. Azathioprine or cyclophosphamide within 12 weeks prior to enrollment c.
             Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα)) inhibitors within 12 weeks prior to enrollment

          -  Participating in other clinical trials involving any other experimental treatment for

             higher than prednisone 5 mg or equivalent per day

          -  Subjects with active or incompletely treated pulmonary tuberculosis, or known history
             of non-tuberculosis mycobacterium over past 12 months
