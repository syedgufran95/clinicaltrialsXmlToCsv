      Establish a COVID-19 biorepository to aid in developing our knowledge of the disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While SARS-CoV-2 has some similarities to the SARS-CoV pathogen that led to an epidemic in
      2002 and 2003, there is much about the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation,
      diagnosis, and treatment of the novel virus that remains unknown.3 Additional research is
      needed to explore the nature of the virus, its spectrum of disease, and potential therapies
      to combat its spread. The aim of this project will be to establish a biorepository of blood
      samples from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 that can then be used by investigators to
      expand our understanding of COVID-19 and its treatment and, in turn, improve patient
      outcomes.

      The COVID-19 biorepository will accomplish the following specific aims:

        1. Establish a collection of biospecimens from patients with COVID-19.

        2. Establish a link between biospecimens and longitudinal individual patient data, which
           will be collected and stored in RedCap.

        3. Provide biospecimens and unique patient data to researchers investigating COVID-19.
           Separate IRB approval will be needed for these studies.

      Biospecimens to be collected include serum and plasma. Blood samples will be collected,
      processed, aliquoted, and stored at -80Â°C. A portion of the blood samples will be kept for
      DNA and RNA isolation.
