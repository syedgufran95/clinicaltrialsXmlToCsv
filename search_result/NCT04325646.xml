  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On January 2020, the discovery of a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was officially announced by
      the Chinese health authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO). Its complete genome
      was sequenced by the laboratory of respiratory infection viruses at the Institut Pasteur on
      29 January 2020 in France. This will allow the identification of antigenic structures
      involved in the immune response and the development of serological diagnostic tests.

      Many questions are being asked about this new virus and the infection it causes, including
      questions about the percentage of asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic forms. Serological
      studies can provide answers to these questions. There is no serological test for SARS-COV-2
      yet, but the laboratory of respiratory infection viruses at the Institut Pasteur is working
      on its development.

      This study proposes to carry out a collection of samples taken from subjects who travelled to
      China before the epidemic outbreak or suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2.

      As soon as it is available, serology will be performed on the collected samples.

      On January 2020, the discovery of a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was officially announced by
      the Chinese health authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO). This new virus is
      presented as the causative agent of pneumonias. Its complete genome was sequenced by the
      laboratory of respiratory infection viruses at the Institut Pasteur on 29 January 2020 in
      France. This will allow the identification of antigenic structures involved in the immune
      response and the development of serological diagnostic tests.

      Many questions are being asked about this new virus and the infection it causes, including
      questions about the transition from animal to human occur, the beginning of viral circulation
      in humans, the period of contagiousness, the percentage of asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic
      forms. Serological studies can provide answers to these questions. There is no serological
      test for SARS-COV-2 yet, but the laboratory of respiratory infection viruses at the Institut
      Pasteur is working on its development.

      This study proposes to carry out a collection of samples taken from subjects who travelled to
      China before the epidemic outbreak or suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2.

      As soon as it is available, serology will be performed on the collected samples.
