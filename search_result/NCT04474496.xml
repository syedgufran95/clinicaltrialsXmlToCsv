  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 2000 Marshallese will complete an online or telephone survey. Among those who complete
      the survey, 40 participants will be randomly selected and invited to complete an in-depth
      qualitative interview. This survey will collect data describing the impact of COVID-19 on
      self-reported Marshallese persons in the United States. Data collected will help describe: 1)
      risk exposure, 2) knowledge of preventive recommendations, 3) barriers and facilitators to
      implementing preventative recommendations, 4) barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 testing
      when appropriate, and self-care behaviors during COVID-19.

      Specific Aims Aim 1: Document COVID-19 risk exposure for Marshallese community members. Aim
      2: Document Marshallese community members' knowledge of preventive recommendations.

      Aim 3: Document barriers and facilitators to implementing preventative recommendations.

      Aim 4: Document Marshallese community members' barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 testing
      when appropriate.

      Aim 5: Document self-care behaviors during COVID-19. Aim 6: Explore COVID-19 pandemic related
      barriers and facilitators to diabetes self-management among Marshallese adults with T2DM.

      Aim 7: Assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on diabetes self-management activities
      among Marshallese adults with T2DM.
