    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      Astrostem-V, allogenic adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells (AdMSC), in patients
      with COVID-19 pneumonia. After each subject completes 12-Weeks visit (Visit 12) and the data
      management team confirms all individual data have no issue, the individual database will be
      locked and the blinding will be open for the statistical analysis.

    <description>Perform chest X-ray or CT every week (W1 - W4) after screening, baseline, and W4 followed by 2 - week intervals (W6, W8). The investigator of each clinical trial organ shall check chest X-ray or CT for bilateral shading and evaluate them.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SOFA score (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Check the SOFA score every week from the baseline to the W4 (W1 - W4) and 2 weeks after the W4 (W6, W8). The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) is a simple and clinically useful indicator that can be used to assess, predict, and monitor long-term failure in patients with multiple organ failure, and therefore increase in SOFA score can be expected to result in multiple organ failure and worse prognosis.</description>
