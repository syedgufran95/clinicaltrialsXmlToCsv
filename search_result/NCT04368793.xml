  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The noval coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) would cause physical and psychological
      dysfunctions in infected patients. We expect that an intelligence-based remote pulmonary
      rehabilitation scheme could improve patients' health status after hospital discharge. The
      intelligence-based remote pulmonary rehabilitation program is designed in a real-world and
      prospective manner, aiming to evaluate the efficacy of rehabilitation among 200 patients in
      the epicenter of China (Wuhan City) according to their varied adherence. An eight-week
      rehabilitation scheme, including two weeks for physicians and physiotherapists remotely
      guided training, and six weeks for patient self-management, will be addressed. The primary
      outcome of current study is six-minute walking distance and lung function, and secondly
      respiratory muscle strength, physical fitness assessment, symptoms and quality of life, etc.
      will also be assessed. Recruited patients will be followed up at week 2, 4, 8 after
      enrollment and at month 1, 3, 6, 12 after the rehabilitation training completed,
      respectively. The study has been approved by the ethics committee of China-Japan Friendship
      Hospital and three participating centers in Wuhan City.
