  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Describe the immune response of patients affected by SARS-CoV-2, including an assessment of
      the types of antibodies elicited by the infection, specifc antibody titers for the different
      isotypes, evolution of the antibody response over time, protective efficacy and immune
      correlates of protection.

      investigate genetic determinants of Covid-19 and of the imune response to this condition.

      Finally, the study will investigate secondary infection rate and its determinants among
      household contacts of Covid-19 patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to describe the immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus
      among patients with confirmed Covid-19 disease in terms of antibody levels, differences in
      response related to epidemiologic and clinical characteristics, duration of the antibody
      response and protective efficacy.

      Of particular interest is the demonstration of seroconversion with neutralizing antibodies,
      their duration during a follow-up of two years and their ability to prevent subsequent
      infections and disease. If antibodies are demonstrated to protect against subsequent
      infections and that protection is long-lasting, this can be instrumental for the
      reincorporation of immune individuals into normal life and economic activities.

      Additional secondary objectives include determination of population-prevalence of past
      infection and assessment of genetic determinants of the immune response and the clinical
      presentation of the disease. Finally, we will investigate secondary transmission in a sample
      of household contacts of Covid-19 cases.

      This study will provide important information to define the use of specific types of
      antibodies and their potential utility for diagnosis, ascertainment of previous exposure and
      acquired immunity. The effort is being conducted by the Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social,
      the Costa Rican Ministry of Health and the Agencia Costarricense de Investigaciones
      Biomédicas (ACIB), in collaboration with the US National Cancer Institute, the US National
      Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the German Cancer Research Center and will
      be supervised by the Ethical Committee of the CCSS according to local regulations.

        This observational study will involve the recruitment of a large series of cases from Costa
        Rica,including both patients who already recovered from the disease and newly diagnosed
        cases, regardless of the severity of the clinical presentation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Recruitment of cases Eligibility criteria Inclusion criteria

        Potential participants will be deemed eligible if they are:

          -  Diagnosed with Covid-19 disease by a positive PCR test in Costa Rica since March 2020

          -  Able to communicate with study personnel (or parents for children under 12);

          -  Able and willing to provide a blood sample (or parents);

          -  Not planning to move put of the study area in the next 12 months Exclusion criteria

        Potential participants will be excluded or deferred from enrollment if:

          -  They are in critical clinical condition precluding enrollment at the discretion of the
             treating clinicians (deferral)

          -  The clinician determining eligibility in agreement with the principal investigator
             considers that there is a reason that precludes participation;

          -  The participant or her parent/legal guardian, as applicable, does not have an
             identification document.

        Enrollment of active cases Most of the cases of Covid-19 are treated at CCSS hospitals or
        clnics, where the it is a disease of mandatory reporting. Personnel of the Social Security
        or Ministry of Health will inform the potential participant case about the study and ask if
        they are willing to be contacted by study personnel to receive further information. The
        intention is to recruit all cases with the disease registered in Costa Rica.

        Enrollment of recovered cases

        Recovered cases are subjects previously diagnosed with Covid-19 via a positive PCR test who
        were considered recovered because they had two consecutive negative PCR tests. The first
        cases was diagnosed in March 2020. They will be contacted and recruited at home based on
        the registration lists of the CCSS and the Ministry of Health, their eligibility criteria
        and consent procedures will be similar to those of the active cases, but their specimen
        collection will be different Community control group selection and enrollment Inclusion
