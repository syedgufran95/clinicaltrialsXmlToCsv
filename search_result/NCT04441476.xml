  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intensive care unit occupies a particular place in our health care system. The urgency of
      the clinical situations, the proportion of deaths encountered, and the daily workload is
      likely to generate suffering among staff. The health crisis linked to SARS-COV-2 is
      unprecedented and has leads to the unprecedented mobilisation of care providers, particularly
      in the ICU. Faced with the massive and growing influx of patients, human, therapeutic and
      material resources are overwhelmed and the teams are faced with an unusually heavy workload
      in a context of extreme tension. These professionals are thus exposed to a risk of
      over-investment, in a context of acute and repetitive stress, over an indeterminate period of
      time combining workload, emotional intensity with specific ethical issues, simultaneously
      affecting the professional sphere but also the personal and family sphere (confinement, risk
      of contamination). Now more than ever, the mental health of caregivers is an important
      concern, as highlighted by the CCNE. Mental health is understood in the way in which the
      individual responds specifically to work-related suffering by developing individual and
      collective defensive strategies. Thus, the issue of mental health in the ICU cannot be
      considered without taking into account the strategies that professionals put in place to
      combat stress and to contribute or not to the construction and stabilization of the work
      collective (collaboration, support). Ethical and/or psychological support systems have been
      set up in most of the establishments involved in the care of Covid-19 patients. However, the
      adequacy of these systems relative to the needs of professionals during and after the crisis
      is not yet known. We hypothesize that the psychological and social repercussions of this
      pandemic as well as the individual and collective strategies deployed by ICU care providers
      to deal with it will evolve in view of the progression of the crisis but also of the various
      types of support, particularly psychological and/or ethical, available to them.

    <description>An online questionnaire (Limesurvey platform) will be made available at 4 different times (M0, M1, M2 and M6).
The first questionnaires (M0 and M1) will include a component for professional characterization. Generic and specific stress factors related to ICU and the current pandemic and collective and individual defensive strategies will also be collected in M0 and M1.
At M2 and M6, the traumatic impact of the crisis, burnout, signs of depression and recourse to internal or external support in the department (occupational medicine, support unit) will be collected.</description>
