  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of the combination
      hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin (HCQ and AZ) in reducing the infection risk among health
      care professionals in direct contact with COVID-19 patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exceptional efforts have been paid globally to apply the latest and most effective means of
      universal standard precautions throughout the settings facing COVID-19 crisis, and this is
      led by health care providers who are more vulnerable and have a higher risk of getting the
      infection (8.3% in Italy) and a higher rate of complications and mortality with some reports
      suggesting high mortality among these individuals.

      While several clinical trials are underway across the globe to examine the effect of
      chloroquine at the moment, the number of COVID-19 cases is still on the rise and health care
      workers are facing a very high risk of getting the infection. In this study, we aim to study
      prophylactic efficacy of the combination (HCQ and AZ) among health care professionals in a 16
      weeks period.
