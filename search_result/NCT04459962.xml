      Can Nanotechnology Biomarker Tagging (NBT) be used to detect COVID-19 infection in people
      presenting for COVID-19 testing?

      NBT can be used to detect the substances present in a person's breath. In this study the
      breath of people presenting for COVID-19 testing is going to be analysed. Analysing a large
      number of samples from people with COVID-19 (as confirmed by the standard swab test used by
      the NHS) will enable a breath profile to be produced, ie the substances present in the breath
      when someone has COVID-19. After the profile has been validated, NBT can be used to test
      whether or not a person has COVID-19 by seeing if their breath matches the profile.

      Using this technology for COVID-19 testing has advantages over the current standard test. The
      sample can be analysed immediately in the clinical setting and the results are available in
      5-10 minutes, so if the person tests negative they can go back to their normal life straight
      away. The current swab test takes around 72 hours for the results to be available, and the
      person needs to self-isolate during this time in case they test positive, resulting in
      potentially unnecessary days of work missed and inconvenience. The breath test is
      non-invasive and is unlikely to cause any discomfort, as the person is only required to
      breath normally into the device. This study will also review the practicalities of using this
      test. It is quick and easy to train people in how to carry out the test, so it could
      potentially easily be rolled out to testing sites.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Cohort Study which will collect non-invasive, expired breath sample, cheek swab and
      a Medical and Lifestyle questionnaire from participants.

      When the participant presents for COVID-19 testing they will be asked to provide a cheek swab
      and breath sample, and complete the study questionnaire. They will not need to give any
      identifiable information or have a second visit. The samples will be analysed immediately and
      disposed of as clinical waste. ANCON will then use the data to build a breath profile of
      COVID-19 infection.

      Sample and data collection method for inpatients:

        -  Sequential (daily or every other day as able) breath and swab test will be taken from
           some of the patients admitted in the hospital (inpatients).

        -  This will be taken from entry or start of the study to discharge or end of study or
           until patient or medical staff deem unsuitable to continue

        -  This will enable to track infection and the relevant profile changes as covid-19
           progresses and/or is treated. This will provide vital additional information around
           identifiers associated with the disease and its progress.

      Anonymous Questionnaire - Each participant will be asked questions in the form of a short
      standard questionnaire based on:

        -  Medical Information

        -  Lifestyle Information
