      Background:

      COVID-19 is an acute respiratory syndrome. One symptom of COVID-19 is a reduction in the
      number of cells called lymphocytes in the blood. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell
      that fights infections. With fewer lymphocytes, the body cannot effectively fight back
      against SARS CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Researchers want to better understand how
      SARS-CoV-2 affects these blood cells. This information may give them ideas for new
      treatments.

      Objective:

      To learn more about how SARS-CoV-2 affects lymphocytes, the immune, and the blood clotting
      system.

      Eligibility:

      Adults age 18 and older who either currently have COVID-19 or have recently recovered from it

      Design:

      Participants will give a blood sample. For this, a needle is used to collect blood from an
      arm vein. For participants who have a central line, blood will be collected through that
      instead.

      Participants medical records related to COVID-19 will be reviewed.

      Participants who have recovered from COVID-19 will be asked to undergo leukapheresis to
      collect white blood cells. For this, blood is taken from a needle placed in one arm. A
      machine separates out the white blood cells. The rest of the blood is returned to the
      participant through a needle placed in the other arm. This takes about 2-3 hours.

      Recovered participants may have material collected from inside the nostrils and/or rectum.
      This is done by gently rubbing the area with a sterile cotton swab.

      Recovered participants may have an echocardiogram to look at their heart. For this, a small
      probe is held against the chest to get pictures of the heart from different angles. This
      takes less than 30 minutes.

      Participation lasts 1-2 days on most cases and may be split in a few visits for recovered
      patients if leukapheresis and echocardiogram are done.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory syndrome caused by the novel
      coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The emergence of
      SARS-CoV-2 has led to a pandemic with a wide range of manifestations. One of the hallmarks of
      severe illness is the presence of elevated levels of inflammatory biomarkers, coagulopathy,
      and lymphopenia. Lymphopenia is a robust and consistent predictor of mortality in COVID-19.
      Understanding the intersection of inflammation, complement activation, endothelial damage,
      and coagulation is critical to a better understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.

      This is a multisite study that will conducted at the National Institutes of Health Clinical
      Center and other local hospitals. We will recruit patients with mild to severe COVID-19, as
      well as patients who have recently recovered from the disease. Participants will have 1-2
      study visits to have blood drawn via venipuncture or available venous access, with optional
      leukapheresis, nasal and rectal swabs, and echocardiogram for recovered patients. Blood will
      be used for genetic testing, lymphocyte phenotyping, soluble biomarker analysis, and other
      research tests. Clinical and laboratory data from routine care (eg, basic demographic
      information, vital signs, medications, clinical labs, and radiologic imaging) will also be
      collected.
