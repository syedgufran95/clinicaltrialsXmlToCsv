  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an urgent need to evaluate interventions that could be effective against the
      infection with SARS-CoV 2. Tannins based wood extracts are an inexpensive and safe product
      with protective effect in both bacterial and viral infections likely due to its anti-
      inflammatory, anti-oxidative effects and their modulation of the intestinal microbiota. This
      randomized controlled trial seeks to evaluate the efficacy of the tannins based dietary
      supplement ARBOX in positive COVID-19 patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The epidemic of 2019 novel coronavirus (causing the disease Covid-19) has expanded from Wuhan
      throughout China and is being exported to a growing number of countries, some of which have
      seen onward transmission. COVID-19 caused clusters of severe respiratory illness and was
      associated with 2% mortality. There is currently no vaccine and no specific antiviral
      treatment recommended for COVID-19. About 20% of the patients were severe and the mainstay of
      clinical management is largely symptomatic treatment, with organ support in intensive care
      for seriously ill patients. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic
      approach to COVID-19.

      Tannins have been shown to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial properties and
      a regulatory effect on the gastrointestinal metabolism.

      The investigators will realize a prospective, double-blind, randomized trial to assess the
      effect of treatment with a dietary supplement (ARBOX), a molecular complex of quebracho and
      chestnut tannins extract and Vit B12, compared with placebo. 140 COVID-19 patients will be
      recruited in a single center in Buenos Aires Argentina. 70 patients will receive conventional
      treatment plus ARBOX (treated group) and 70 patients will receive conventional treatment plus
      placebo (control group). The effects will be evaluated during the 28 days follow up. The
      primary end point will be the time of discharge from the hospital. A panel of 27 cytokines
      level, intestinal microbiota composition and its metabolites will be assessed at day 1 and
      14.

    <description>Participants will receive a supply of 28 -- 390 mg ARBOX capsules for 14 days. Patients will be supplemented with 2 capsules of ARBOX per day and standard therapy.
Standard treatment includes: Antipyretics or Lopinavir / Ritonavir, Azithromycin and Hydroxychloroquine, as appropriate (treatment currently recommended by the department of Infectious Diseases of the Hospital de Clínicas that could undergo to modifications). In addition, if necessary: supplemental O2, non-invasive ventilation, antibiotic therapy.</description>
