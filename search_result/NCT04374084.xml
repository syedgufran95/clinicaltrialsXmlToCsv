  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of moxibustion plus cupping in the
      convalescence of COVID-19.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Moxibustion plus cupping may be effective and safe for convalescent patients with COVID-19,
      but evidence is limited. The randomized clinical trial may help to provide evidence-based
      factors for improving the patients' symptoms in the convalescence of COVID-19.

    <description>Moxibustion plus cupping and basic therapy (rehabilitation direction and basic breathing exercise) once a day for 4 weeks (28 sessions).The moxibustion plus cupping treatments were divided into 2 alternating formulas:
A: Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday: moxibustion on bilateral Fengmen (BL12), Feishu (BL13) and Pishu(BL20) B: Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday: moxibustion on Zhongwan (RN12), Qihai (RN6), bilateral Tianshu(ST25) and Zusanli(ST36) + cupping on bilateral Feishu(BL13) Geshu(BL17) Pishu(BL20) The 2 formulas were used alternatively every other day, 7 times per week, for 4 weeks. Moxibustion acupoint addition: profuse sweating added Fuliu (KI7), insomnia added Shenmen(HT7) anxiety or depression added Neiguan (PC6).</description>

    <intervention_name>Moxibustion plus Cupping</intervention_name>
    <description>Moxibustion: The burning of a small, thimble sized, smoldering plug of dried leaves on the skin at an acupuncture point. Usually the plugs contain leaves of mugwort or moxa. Cupping takes the pot as a tool, uses the combustion to remove the air in the pot, causes a negative pressure, and makes it adsorb on the skin of the acupoints. Use&quot;Baixiaojiu&quot;moxibustion on each acupoint for 10-15 minutes, the temperature of moxibustion should be adjusted within patient's tolerance level. Use diameter of 5-6 cm acuum cupper to cupping on each acupoint for 5-8 minutes.</description>
