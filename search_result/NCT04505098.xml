      MITIGATE is a prospective, open-label, parallel-group, randomized, pragmatic clinical trial.
      The MITIGATE Study has been designed to evaluate the real-world clinical effectiveness of
      pre-treatment with icosapent ethyl (IPE), also known as VascepaÂ®, compared to usual standard
      of care to prevent and reduce the sequelae of laboratory-confirmed viral upper respiratory
      infection (URI)-related (i.e., COVID-19, influenza, and other known viral respiratory
      pathogens) morbidity and mortality in a high-risk cohort of adults with established
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

    <textblock>
      For the MITIGATE study, eligible members receiving care within Kaiser Permanente Northern
      California (KPNC) will be identified and screened electronically in a 1:10 intervention to
      control allocation (i.e., IPE vs. usual care) stratified by age and pre-existing respiratory
      status. Patients randomly assigned and enrolled into the intervention arm will be asked to
      take IPE (2 grams by mouth twice daily) for a minimum of 6 months and until study completion.
      Patients assigned to the control arm (i.e., usual care) will be passively followed only
      electronically via the electronic health record (EHR).
