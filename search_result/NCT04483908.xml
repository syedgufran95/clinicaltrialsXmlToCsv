    <textblock>
      This study is to analyse the antibody response in the blood and saliva of people with a known
      COVID-19 infection in the canton of Baselland.

      The study aims to validate strategies to measure antibody levels with minimal intervention
      and to explore the antibody response and technical capacity for said measurement. The study
      will collect the minimally necessary samples to deduce a strategy for serum or saliva
      surveillance of the population of the canton Baselland. To achieve this, the study is
      designed to address the following points:

        -  determine specificity, sensitivity and general utility of point of care (POC) and ELISA
           tests to deduce a strategy for serum surveillance of the population of the canton
           Baselland

        -  especially validate different POC kits in regard of their use for continuous
           surveillance

        -  gain an understanding of seroconversion and antibody levels of patients and survivors

        -  gain an understanding of the individual antibody and T-cell repertoire of patients and
           survivors

        -  study whether patterns of convergent antibody evolution is generated in the surviving
           population or whether the diseases survivors generated an antibody pool recognizing a
           specific epitope

        -  develop the technology to correlate blood antibody levels with levels detected in the
           saliva

        -  develop high throughput technologies for the precise detection of immune cell Repertoire
           and binding epitopes
