  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main manifestation of COVID-19 is acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF). In patients
      with AHRF, the need for invasive mechanical ventilation is associated with high mortality.

      Prone positioning (PP) is a recommended strategy for patients with moderate to severe acute
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation.

      Early PP combined with High Flow Oxygen Therapy may benefit spontaneous breathing patients
      with AHRF due to COVID-19 as recently reported in Jiangsu.

      Our hypothesis is that early PP combined with High Flow Oxygen Therapy in patients with AHRF
      due to COVID-19 improves oxygenation.
