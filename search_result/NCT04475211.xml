  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Lille University Hospital developped a research objective common to all the services
      which took care of patients, &quot;suspected patient&quot;, &quot;possible case&quot;, &quot;probable case&quot; or
      &quot;confirmed case&quot; infected with SARS-CoV-2 by constituting a prospective and a retrospective
      observational cohort which allowed pooling and sharing the resources and data collected. In
      the next two years the prospective cohort will allow to continue inclusions in a standardized
      way mainly for the constitution of a negative control group (excluded cases), to collect
      biological samples which had not been collected in the retrospective cohort so that the
      pathophysiology of the COVID-19 will be better apprehended as for example the inflammatory
      response to the viral infection. Finally in case of a second epidemic wave in the Hauts De
      France, it seems essential to have a defined research protocol which had already received all
      the necessary authorizations to guarantee cutting-edge (or quality ) research in a center
      like the Lille University Hospital.The aim objective of this study is to identify predictive
      factors of mortality to day 28 infection to SARS-CoV-2 for patients under medical care for
      the COVID-19 in the Lille University Hospital thanks to the constitution of an
      epidemiological, clinical, biological, immunological, genetic, microbiological,
      anatomopathologic, radiological, therapeutic database and so record the results of functional
      exploration exams.
