  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 has forced worldwide the implementation of unprecedented
      restrictions to control its rapid spread and mitigate its impact. The Spanish government has
      enforced social distancing, quarantine and home confinement. This restriction of daily life
      activities and separation from loved ones may lead to social isolation and loneliness with
      health-related consequences in community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment
      or mild dementia and their caregivers. Additionally, an inadequate access to healthcare and
      social support services may aggravate chronic conditions. Technology home-based interventions
      emerge for combating social isolation and loneliness preventing the risk of viral exposure.

      The aim of this multicentre cohort study is to explore, analyze and determine the impact of
      social isolation on: 1) cognition, quality of life, mood, technophilia and perceived stress
      of community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, and on
      caregiver burden; 2) health and social care services access and utilization, and 3)
      cognitive, social and entertainment use of ICTs.

      This study will be conducted in two Spanish regions Andalucía (Málaga) and Cataluña
      (Tarrasa). In total 414 dyads, consisting of a person with mild cognitive impairment or mild
      dementia (PMCI/MD) and their informal caregiver will be contacted by telephone. Potential
      respondents will be participants of the SMART 4 MD (N=2921), TV-AssistDem (N=100) and
      INFINITy (N=23) clinical trials.

      The change in means in the variables will be analyzed comparing baseline results in the
      previous studies with those during and after confinement using the ANOVA test of repeated
      measures or the non-parametric Friedman test if appropriate. The performance of a
      multivariate analysis of variance (ANCOVA) to introduce possible covariates will also be
      contemplated. A 95% confidence level will be used.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has forced worldwide government authorities to implement
      unprecedented restrictions to control its rapid spread and mitigate its impact. In response
      to the outbreak, Spain declared by royal decree (463/2020) a national emergency, with the
      exceptional measure of a Nationwide lockdown enforcing social distancing, quarantine of those
      exposed to the disease and home confinement of those who remain healthy allowing only
      essential outings. This home-confinement by restriction of movement of daily life activities
      and social distancing from loved ones may be a challenging and unpleasant experience for
      those who undergo it, experiencing social isolation and loneliness with health-related
      consequences. Vulnerable populations at higher risk are fragile community-dwelling older
      adults whose chronic conditions may be aggravated by the consequences of the confinement and
      in particular, people with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia.

      QUALITY ASSURANCE PLAN. Researchers will report and review the process during the trial
      covering participant enrolment, consent, follow-up, policies to protect participants,
      including reporting of harm and completeness, accuracy, and timelines of data collection.

      STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES. Participants will be interviewed by telephone. Potential
      respondents will be participants of the SMART 4 MD (NCT03325699), TV-AssistDem (NCT03653234)
      and INFINITy (PGA19342) clinical trials, which all aim to assess the effects of ICTs to
      support dementia: using a tablet-based health application, an intelligent system and a
      TV-based assistive integrated service, respectively.

      Baseline assessments prior to the COVID-19 confinement (T0) of cognition, quality of life,
      depression, and technophilia of the PMCI/MD and caregiver burden will be compared with
      assessments carried out during the confinement measures (T1) and after the termination of the
      measures (T2). Additionally, perceived stress regarding the confinement situation will be
      measured at T1 and T2.

      Participants will not receive financial reimbursement for taking part in this trial.

      DATA DICTIONARY. All variables collected in this study are listed and described in an
      electronic Case Report Form (CRF), with associated guidelines, to ensure consistency in all
      gathered data. The following data will be collected in this trial:

      Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease Scale (QoL-AD Scale)
      European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 3 Levels (EuroQoL-5D-3L) Geriatric Depression Scale
      (GDS) Instrument for Measuring Older People's Attitudes Toward Technology (TechPH) Perceived
      Stress Scale (PSS) Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI-12)

      Other data: Sociodemographical data. Medical history - PMCI/MD only. Health
      perception-management: Change of living arrangements due to lockdown, presence of COVID-19
      symptoms in PMCI/MD and/or relatives, access to COVID-19 information, devices used
      (SmartPhone, Tablet, Computer, Smart-TV, other), understanding of the information and contact
      with healthcare and social resources to manage the situation. Ability to manage illnesses,
      medication, changes and/or cancellations of previous medical appointments, renewal of
      prescriptions and provision of supports for the purchase of medication and food.
      Coping-stress tolerance: Mental health and well-being self-perceived mood. Sleep-rest :
      Alterations in usual sleep patterns and use of additional medication. Leisure activities:
      including preferred physical, intellectual, recreational and social activities. Social
      support: social connectedness (telephone call, video call, texting...), devices used
      (SmartPhone, Tablet, Computer, Smart-TV, other)

      STATISTICS ANALYSIS PLAN. The flow of participants will be shown schematically with counts
      and percentages in a CONSORT diagram. All variables collected will be summarized at baseline
      and at follow-up. Statistics considered for presentation for continuous measures in summary
      tables will be the mean, minima and maxima, and standard deviation, and if the criteria of
      normality are not met, the median and the first and third quartiles. Categorical variables
      will be summarized using counts and percentages. The change in means in the study variables
      will be analyzed with respect to the results during the previous studies (SMART 4 MD,
      TV-AssistDem and INFINITy) with those currently collected using the ANOVA test of repeated
      measures or the non-parametric Friedman test if appropriate. The performance of a
      multivariate analysis of variance (ANCOVA) to introduce possible covariates will also be
      contemplated. A 95% confidence level will be used for all comparisons. The R version 3.6.1
      program will be used. for all statistical analysis.

      PLAN FOR MISSING DATA. Each researcher is responsible for ensuring that any missing data will
      be reported as missing in the study database. Procedures can sometimes be considered when
      using statistical methods that fail in the presence of any missing values, or when in the
      case of multiple-predictor statistical models all the data for an individual would be omitted
      because of a missing value in one of the predictors.

      METHODS TO ENSURE VALIDITY AND QUALITY OF DATA. Accurate and reliable data collection will be
      assured by verification and cross-check of the CRF. Discrepancies and queries will be
      generated accordingly in the CRF for online resolution by the researcher. In addition, the
      CRF data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis for scientific plausibility.

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (23) will be used to assess the cognitive function of the PMCI/MD. The most common cutoff scores for cognitive impairment and dementia are ranging 23 to 27 over 30. As telephone call interviewing will be the safest means to communicate with the PMCI/MD during and after the COVID-19 pandemic the 22 items telephone version of the MMSE will be used (24). All points of the MMSE can be covered in the telephone version except the last section assessing language and motor skills. In the phone version, we will ask the subject to repeat a phrase and name one item (For example: &quot;Tell me, what is the name of the object you are using to talk to me?&quot;). However, a second item will be not be named, nor will be the person be asked to follow a three-stage command, read and obey a sentence, write a sentence, or copy an intersecting pentagon as in the original version.</description>

    <measure>Change on quality of life in Alzheimer´s Disease in people with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia prior to, during and after confinement.</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease Scale (QoL-AD) (19-22) is an instrument specifically designed to measure QoL in PMCI/MD from the perspective of both the patient and the informal caregiver. It is a 13-item measure, which includes assessments of the person´s relationships with friends and family, financial situation, physical condition, mood, memory, and an overall assessment of life quality. Response are 4-point multiple choice options (1 = poor, 2= fair, 3= good, 4 = excellent). Scale scores range from 13 to 52, with higher scores indicating greater quality of life.
When cognitive function may be compromised, informal caregivers will complete the QoL-AD, on behalf of the PMCI/MD.</description>

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 3 Levels (EuroQoL-5D-3L) is a standardized generic instrument consisting of a descriptive system and a visual analogue scale (VAS).
The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions covering mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, moderate problems and extreme problems. A 1-digit number expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.
The VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical scale, where the endpoints are 100 = 'The best health you can imagine' and 0 = 'The worst health you can imagine'.
EuroQoL-5D-3L has been shown to correlate well with QoL-AD, indicating that using both measures side-by-side is compatible.</description>

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) (25) will be used to assess mood. Of the 15 items, 10 indicate depression when answered positively, while the rest (1, 5, 7, 11, 13) when answered negatively. Scores of 0-4 are considered normal, 5-8 indicate mild depression, 9-11 moderate depression, and 12-15 severe depression.</description>

    <measure>Change on technophilia in people with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia prior to, during and after confinement.</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Instrument for Measuring Older People's Attitudes Toward Technology (TechPH) measures older people's attitudes and enthusiasm for health technology (26). This instrument refers to technophilia as a person's enthusiasm for and positive feelings toward their technology use and absence of the fears and doubts some older people could have about their ability to manage using new technology. The six items of the instrument measure two factors of technophilia: 3 items concerning techEnthusiasm and 3 items techAnxiety. Response are constructed with a five-point Likert scale questionnaire, ranging from 1 (fully disagree) to 5 (fully agree).</description>

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) measures the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. The scale has 10 questions regarding feelings and thoughts during the last month and are rated according to frecuency 0 = Never 1 = Almost Never 2 = Sometimes 3 = Fairly Often 4 = Very Often. PSS scores are obtained by reversing responses (e.g., 0 = 4, 1 = 3, 2 = 2, 3 = 1 &amp; 4 = 0) to the four positively stated items (items 4, 5, 7, &amp; 8) and then summing across all scale items</description>

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI-12) is a 12-item scale with each answer chosen from a 5-point Likert scale (Nearly always=4, Quite frequently=3, Sometimes=2, Rarely=1, Never=0). It is a shortened version of the original scale, was developed specifically for informal caregivers of PMCI/MD and covers issues such as caregiver stress and the degree to which caring is affecting their health and social life. Total score range 0 to 48 (0-10= no to mild burden, 10-20= mild to moderate burden &gt;20= high burden).</description>

    <measure>Change on healthcare and social support services access prior to, during and after confinement.</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI) (32,33) scale will be used to evaluate the service utilization. This scale is an internationally used method for gathering data on service utilization and other domains relevant for economic analysis of mental health care. It has five sections: background client information, accommodation and living situation, employment history, earnings and benefits, a record of services usually used and information about informal caregiver support. The sections assessed will be consultations, admissions and visits, grouped into subsections according to hospital, specialist, primary or home care. Treatment related to hospital admissions or illness exacerbation will also be assessed. It´s adaptability ensures it is compatible with the research aims, context, participants' likely circumstances, and the quantity and precision of information required.</description>
