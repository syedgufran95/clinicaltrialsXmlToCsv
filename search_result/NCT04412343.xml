    <description>Individuals in the (virtual) group-based exercise program, will have the opportunity to take part in (virtual) group exercise classes, delivered via videoconferencing, by experienced older adult exercise instructors. Personnel who analyze the data collected from the study are not aware of the treatment applied to any given group. Classes will be offered multiple days a week at 9am PST (12 noon EST), and will last approximately 50 minutes. Classes include a warm-up component, moderate intensity exercises as the core component of the class, and a cool-down. At the end of classes participants will have the opportunity to connect in small groups (videoconferencing breakout groups) to socially connect over a beverage (coffee, water) from their own homes. Participants in the group condition will also be sent, by mail, a program t-shirt to foster a sense of distinctiveness.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Personal exercise</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Each of the older adult instructors described above will also contribute to delivering pre-recorded exercise classes (involving the same exercises, intensity, music, and so forth as those described above for the group condition). However, in this instance, instructors will deliver those classes to each participant by referring to themselves as each participant's personal trainer/coach, with language directed to the individual and not the group. That is, no sense of 'groupness' or 'shared social identities/connectivity' will be primed. Also, participants in this condition will not have the opportunity to interact with other older adults after classes have ended and will not receive the same program t-shirts designed to foster a sense of group distinctiveness.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Wait-list control</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Those randomized to the wait-list control condition will go about their daily lives for the duration of the 12-week trial. They will be asked to complete the same questionnaires (and will be remunerated in the same way as those in the other two conditions via $10 per questionnaire completion). At the end of the 12-week trial, participants in this condition will have access to the personal exercise programming.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive weekly exercise courses delivered virtually to a group of older adults. This intervention will last for 12 weeks. Participants in addition to participating in exercise will have designated time after each exercise class to socially connect. Participants in this condition will also receive a t-shirt.</description>
