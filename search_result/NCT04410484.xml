  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To find out what adaptations have been made by Inflammatory bowel disease physicians and
      patients in relation to therapies in flaring IBD patients during severe acute respiratory
      syndrome 2-COV and what the impact of these is on IBD patients with no symptomatic COVID-19
      and in suspected/confirmed COVID-19. Also whether there any IBD related factors impacting the
      outcome of patients with COVID-19 symptoms or COVID-19 disease

  <detailed_description>

      An observational, retrospective, case-controlled study to determine the status of IBD during
      development of COVID-19 symptoms/positive COVID-19. The aim is to describe the adaptations in
      therapies for active IBD during SARS COV 2 in patients with active IBD and positive or
      negative COVID-19 symptoms. It will evaluate IBD outcomes following development of COVID-19
      symptoms / positive COVID-19 and determine any predictors of outcomes in IBD patients with
      COVID-19 symptoms / positive COVID-19 as well as determine the impact on IBD outcomes
      resulting from adaptations to treatments during COVID-19
