    <textblock>
      This study is a research project to evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for
      post-exposure prophylaxis and early treatment of Covid-19. The intervention entails
      administering prophylactic hydroxychloroquine to all contacts (Study 1) and treating non
      severe confirmed cases with hydroxychloroquine (Study 2).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a drug that has been extensively used for the prevention of
      malaria. HCQ showed excellent in vitro results and strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV-2
      infection of primate cells at low concentration. Empirical data for the efficacy of HCQ in
      hospitalized Covid-19 patients became available after the start of this study; HCQ
      administration did not result in a significantly higher PCR negative conversion in a RCT
      including 150 patients and there was no reduction in the risk of death/intubation in two
      large observational studies.

      Study 1 -We investigated the efficacy and safety of HCQ to prevent secondary SARS-CoV-2
      infection and Covid-19 disease in contacts exposed to a PCR-positive Covid-19 case during.

      Study 2- We also conducted a study to test the hypothesis that HCQ treatment would be more
      efficacious than no-treatment for patients with mild Covid-19.

      Initially, the protocol included the use of combined treatment with a HIV protease inhibidor
      (cobicistat-boosted darunavir) for cases (study 2), but it was adapted to HCQ alone after the
      recommendation of the pharmaceutical company not to use DRVc for the treatment of Covid-19
      due to lack of activity in-vitro.
