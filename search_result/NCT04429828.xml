  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We have developed an online learning resource designed to support healthcare staff during and
      after the COVID-19 pandemic. This resource has been produced in anticipation of the
      psychological effect of working during this time. This is an open access, free, online
      resource available here: https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/toolkits/play_22794 It is designed to
      be relevant for healthcare staff, and we are evaluating it now with healthcare students as
      our next generation of healthcare staff. We are interested in knowing more about your views
      of healthcare students towards this package. This will help us to determine its value as a
      learning resource to support psychological wellbeing in healthcare students, alongside other
      welfare supports. The aim is to describe the views of healthcare students towards an
      e-learning package developed in response to COVID-19 on Psychological Wellbeing for
      Healthcare Workers.

      The investigators aim to:

        -  gather insight into the emotional highs and lows of being a healthcare student during
           the pandemic

        -  identify any facilitators, obstacles or barriers to accessing the e-package.

        -  identify perceptions of healthcare students towards the value of the e-package during
           and after the COVID19 pandemic.

        -  establish recommendations for longer-term support for psychological wellbeing in
           healthcare students.

      Qualitative interviews will be conducted with up to 45 purposively sampled healthcare
      students who have accessed the e-learning resource. The interview will be semi-structured and
      include a measure of mental wellbeing (Warwick-Edinburgh Wellbeing Scale, 14-item - license
      received), and single items measures of job stressfulness, job satisfaction, presenteeism,
      turnover intentions and work engagement.

      Findings will inform future supportive interventions for healthcare students.
