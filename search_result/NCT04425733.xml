  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics of
      MK-5475 after administration of multiple doses to participants with COVID-19 pneumonia. The
      primary hypothesis is that MK-5475 when administered to participants with COVID-19 pneumonia
      and hypoxemia improves arterial oxygenation as measured by the ratio of blood oxygen
      saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2/FiO2 ratio) compared to placebo.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Day 1 in the Time-weighted Average from 0 through 24 hours (TWA0-24hrs) for the Ratio of Blood Oxygen Saturation to the Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (SpO2/FiO2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1 (pre-dose and 2, 6, 12, 18, 24 hours post-dose)</time_frame>
    <description>The SpO2/FiO2 ratio is a measure of arterial oxygenation. Noninvasive pulse oximetry will be used to obtain the SpO2/FiO2 ratio.
