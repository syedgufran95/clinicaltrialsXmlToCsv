  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The additional effect of personalized health education compared to general education
      following the internationally accepted principles will be evaluated in the prevention of the
      serious course of the novel coronavirus infection. It is hypothesised that personalized
      health education provides a greater degree of lifestyle change, thus the risk of a serious
      course of infection decreases.

    <textblock>
      PROACTIVE-19 is a pragmatic, randomized controlled clinical trial with adaptive &quot;sample size
      re-estimation&quot; design. Volunteers will be randomized into two groups: (A) generalized health
      education; (B) personalized health education. Participants will go through phone questioning
      and recommendation in 5 fields: (1) mental health (2) smoking habits, (3) physical activity,
      (4) dietary habits, (5) alcohol consumption. Both groups A and B will receive the same line
      of questioning to assess habits concerning these topics. In Group A: questioning will be done
      in sequence followed by a shared minimal intervention aimed towards improvement of these
      factors but without any personalized recommendation. In Group B: each assessment will be
      followed by specific and personalized recommendations. Assessment will be done weekly during
      the first month, every second week in the second month, then monthly. Considering one interim
      analysis for efficacy the estimated sample size is 3788 (rounded up to 3800) subject per
      study arm. The planned duration of the follow up is a minimum of one year.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized controlled, adaptive, two-arm, parallel trial. The target patient population consists of adults age above 60 years without confirmed COVID-19 infection or current hospitalization. The sample size calculation suggests that 7576 subjects (3788/ each arm) are required. The allocation ratio is 1:1. Eligible participants in the generalized health education intervention arm will receive healthy lifestyle advice according to World Health Organization (WHO) principles. On the personalized education arm, participants will receive detailed informative intervention regarding lifestyle changes based on their current habits.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The primary endpoint will be the composite of the rate of the followings in COVID-19 positive cases (verified by an accredited laboratory): the number of pariticipants with ICU (intensive care unit) admission; 48 hours of hospitalisation and/or death.
48 hours of hospitalisation for the following reasons: (I) arrhythmia (causing hemodynamic instability and requiring continuous monitoring and/or cardiac support, as indicated by mean arterial pressure &lt;65 mm Hg, and/or serum lactate &gt;2 mmol/L) and/or (II) Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): severe hypoxaemic respiratory failure indicated by a Partial Pressure of Oxygen (PaO2)/Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) &lt;300 mmHg according to the Berlin definition and/or (III) circulatory shock (the requirement of continuous vasopressor support to maintain mean arterial pressure &lt;65 mmHg and/or serum lactate &gt;2 mmol/L)</description>

    <description>The reached changes in lifestyle including mental and physical status will be assessed by a questionnaire.
The questions related to the coronavirus epidemic in will cover in 3 fields: concerns for self, concerns for family, feeling of being overwhelmed on account of news on the epidemic. The answers can be given by a scale ranging from 1-10 points. Higher score indicates greater level of distress.
One question assessess the subjective feeling of being supported, where yes indicates adequate feeling of support and no indicates feeling of being unsupported and/or lonely.</description>
