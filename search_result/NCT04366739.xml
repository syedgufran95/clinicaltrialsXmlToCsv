      This study evaluates the effects of the addition of chlorpromazine to the standard
      therapeutic protocol in COVID 19 patients hospitalized for respiratory symptom management
      (score 3-5 WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement).

      The investigators have observed in GHU-Paris psychiatry Hospital units (140 beds),
      significantly lower prevalence of symptomatic and severe forms of COVID-19 in patients (3%)
      than in the health workers operating in the same facilities (19% of nurses and 18% of
      physicians). COVID-psychiatry units report similar feedback in France, Spain, and Italy. One
      hypothesis could be that psychotropic drugs have a protective action on COVID-19 and protect
      patients from symptomatic and virulent forms of COVID-19.

      This hypothesis is consistent with research studies that have shown that several psychotropic
      drugs inhibit in vitro viral replication of the coronaviruses MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1. The
      SARS-CoV-2 has many characteristics in common with the coronavirus family and has
      phylogenetic similarities to the SARS-CoV-1 engaged in the 2002-2003 outbreak. It is,
      therefore, possible that one or more psychotropic drugs having demonstrated efficacy against
      MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 also have anti-SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity.

      The current global epidemic of COVID-19, with a high number of deaths in many countries,
      makes it urgent to search drugs potentially useful to reduce the severity and lethality of
      the infection. Drug repositioning represents a possible alternative to the news medicines
      discovery. This strategy makes it possible to eliminate many stages of development; it makes
      it possible to deploy a therapy whose side effects are known and which physicians already
      well know how to handle.

      To confirm the hypothesis of the antiviral action of chlorpromazine on SARS-CoV-2, a
      preclinical in vitro experiment began in April 2020 at the level III high-security biological
      laboratory at the Pasteur Institute (in collaboration with the GHU PARIS Psychiatry &amp;
      Neurosciences). The first results are encouraging and show a marked antiviral effect of
      chlorpromazine on SARS-CoV-2. Technical replicas are underway to validate these preliminary
      results.

      By integrating all these evidence, the investigators hypothesize that chlorpromazine could
      decrease the unfavorable evolution of COVID-19 infection when administered at the onset of
      respiratory signs.

Intervention Model Description:
reCoVery is a multi-center, randomized, single-blind, standard care-controlled (1:1) pilot clinical study to explore the efficacy and safety of chlorpromazine (CPZ) in the treatment of adult subjects with COVID-19-moderate type (WHO-OSCI 3-5).</intervention_model_description>
    <primary_purpose>Treatment</primary_purpose>
    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>The evaluator of the primary endpoint and secondary endpoints relating to the clinical efficacy of CPZ and the evaluator of the biological and radiological effects of the CPZ will be maintained blindly throughout their duration of inclusion. This evaluator will collect clinical data, biological data, and imaging data without knowing the drug treatments delivered to patients.
The radiologists responsible for calculating the parenchymal damage score on the thoracic CT scan will be blind to the patient delivered drugs.
The biologists responsible for carrying out the analyzes on the biobank will be blind to the patient delivered drugs.
The biostatistician responsible for statistical study analysis will be kept blind to the drugs delivered to the subjects.</masking_description>

    <description>The primary endpoint is the time to response (TTR) in days, from randomization to 28th day. By response to treatment is meant the reduction of at least one severity level on the World Health Organization Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (WHO-OSCI)
The WHO-OSCI is an ordinal scale of 9 severity levels (from 0 to 8) for COVID-19. This scale was established by the WHO, which recommends its use for any therapeutic study on COVID-19.
This will be a continuous outcome defined by the amount of time between randomization to the first response. This will be treated as a time-to-event with possible censoring.</description>
