  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study design is observational, exploratory study consisting of two cohorts of COVID-19
      patients admitted to the ICU and the medical ward, respectively. The primary outcome focusing
      on the effect of plasma glucose levels on cardiac function will be evaluated by repeated
      assessment of cardiac function by echocardiography and measurement of plasma glucose.
      Furthermore, blood coagulability will be evaluated to determine the importance of diabetes
      status and plasma glucose changes for whole blood coagulability at time of admission to the
      ICU and progression in coagulability abnormalities. In the medical ward cohort, two
      assessments will be performed separated by no more than 12 hours. In the ICU cohort, three
      assessments will be performed separated by no more than 6 hours. Ideally, 60 patients with
      COVID-19 will be included in the ICU cohort with a 1:1 distribution between patient with and
      without diabetes. Ideally, 40 patients with diabetes will be included in the cohort of
      patients admitted to medical ward (hospitalisation cohort).

      The primary hypothesis is that levels of plasma glucose have clinically significant impact on
      left ventricular systolic function in patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU. The
      secondary hypothesis is that the impact of plasma glucose on left ventricular systolic
      function is associated with glycaemic control prior to admission as measured by HbA1c.
