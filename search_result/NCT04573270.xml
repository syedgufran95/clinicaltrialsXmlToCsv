  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This double blind, placebo controlled, multi-arm, multi-site study investigates the safety
      and efficacy of stem cell therapy for the treatment of patients admitted to hospital
      suffering complications from COVID-19 and the treatment of healthy subjects (healthcare
      providers) for prophylactic effect following those patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent preliminary data from Wuhan/China have claimed that intravenous injections of
      mesenchymal stem cells derived from human umbilical chords have resulted in complete recovery
      of COVID-19 infected elderly patients with respiratory failure.

      This study investigates the efficacy and safety of a single umbilical cord derived stem cell
      intravenous injection in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection with fever
      and respiratory illness.

      A second arm will test efficacy and safety of a single umbilical cord derived stem cell
      intravenous injection to healthcare providers at high exposure rates to COVID-19 infection.
