  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study will test the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of RLS-0071 for
      approximately 28 days in comparison to a placebo control in patients with acute lung injury
      due to COVID-19 pneumonia in early respiratory failure.

      Patients will be randomized and double-blinded for two parts, a single-ascending dose (SAD)
      part and a multiple-ascending dose (MAD) part.

      The name of the study drug involved in this study is: RLS-0071.

    <intervention_model_description>Study intervention, RLS-0071 or placebo, will be administered as an IV infusion over 30 minutes (± 10 minutes).
The following dose groups are planned:
Part A (Single-Ascending Dose):
Cohort 1: low dose (single infusion) vs. placebo
Cohort 2: high dose (single infusion) vs. placebo
Part B (Multiple-Ascending Dose):
Cohort 3: low dose administered q8 hours (± 1 hour) vs. placebo for 3 days (9 doses)
