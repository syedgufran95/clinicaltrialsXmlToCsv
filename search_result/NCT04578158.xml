  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe COVID-19 infections are believed to be triggered by an over-reaction of the immune
      system, known as a &quot;cytokine storm&quot; that result in hyperinflammation throughout the body,
      including the lungs, heart and brain. The cytokine storm exacerbates the person's breathing
      difficulties and can lead to potentially fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
      Immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory drugs can play a role in arresting a rapid escalation
      of symptoms.

      Quercetin, a flavonoid, is a known modulator of inflammatory response with strong
      anti-inflammatory capacities including: modulation of NF-kB transcription factor, inhibition
      of cytochines (e.g. TNF-α), inhibition of production of pro-inflammatory enzymes, such as
      cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX), which catalyze the conversion of arachidonic
      acid to its metabolites. The combination of three crucial properties of Quercetin as
      antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory makes it a potential candidate to support
      all unhealthy conditions where oxidative stress, inflammation and immunity are involved. The
      investigators believe that the bioavailable form of Quercetin (Quercetin Phytosome) can
      prevent the disease progression in people with COVID-19 infection and can lead to rapid
      symptoms improvement. The aim of this study is to investigate he adjuvant benefits of
      Quercetin Phytosome in patents with COVID-19.

      Patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and, due to moderate to severe symptoms, hospitalized,
      will be randomized to take tablets containing Quercetin Phytosome (QP) 500 mg, 2 times a
      day:1 tablet during the breakfast and 1 tablet during the dinner, as add-on to the standard
      therapy. The treatment will last for 30 days. The treated patients will be compared with an
      equal group not treated with QP but only with standard therapy. Survival time, symptoms and
      objective (inflammatory) parameters (see Detailed description) will be analyzed as outcomes.
