  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective is to evaluate the feasibility of delivering an online early Eye Movement
      Desensitisation Reprocessing (EMDR) Recent Traumatic Events Protocol (R-TEP) to patients who
      have survived Covid-19 related critical illness, within the context of a randomised
      controlled trial (RCT).

      This will inform the design of a future RCT investigating the effectiveness of EMDR R-TEP in
      reducing psychological symptoms, for adult survivors of intensive care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A significant number of patients worldwide, have been admitted to intensive care suffering
      from Covid-19 related organ failure. Patients who survive a period of critical illness have a
      disproportionately high chance of suffering from significant and persistant poor
      psychological outcomes.

      Eye-Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR) has reduced incidence of psychological
      morbidity in war veterans and victims of man-made and natural disasters. Small studies have
      also shown it to be effective in healthcare settings, within the Emergency department,
      following cancer diagnosis and implantation of cardioverter defibrillators. EMDR is validated
      by UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence guidance for use in treating adult onset
      PTSD.

      Because of ongoing social distancing guidance our study programme aims to investigate whether
      it is feasible to treat patients with an early online Eye Movement Desensitisation
      Reprocessing (EMDR) intervention, delivered soon after hospital discharge and whether this
      intervention will improve psychological outcome for survivors of critical illness.

Protocol adherence
Assignment of causality of serious events will be assessed by the chief investigator. Events attributable to trial procedures will be reviewed by trial management board, study sponsor and the research ethics committee, in order to determine ongoing feasibility.

    <description>EMDR is a form of psychotherapy treatment whereby the client verbally relates a narrative of a traumatic episode or emotionally disturbing material in brief sequential doses while simultaneously focusing on an external stimulus. The EMDR Recent-Traumatic Events protocol (R-TEP) aims to enable an individual to process memories of the event in order to reduce psychological morbidity. EMDR R-TEP should be delivered within 3-months of the onset of a traumatic event.</description>
