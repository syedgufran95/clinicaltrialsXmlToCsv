  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals are having to stay at home in quarantine to reduce
      the risk of transmission of the virus. Depending on the number of occupants and the dwelling
      space available, this can lead to household crowding, which can have an effect on mental
      health. In addition, the closing of leisure facilities, including restaurants, cafes and,
      with the need to self-isolate and socially distance, has led to loneliness. The focus on
      &quot;loneliness&quot; has recently been on a rise, and being described as an epidemic, especially when
      it has been shown to be associated with various diseases as well as increased risk of
      mortality. Studies conducted on participants in isolation has shown increased mental health
      issues including anxiety, stress and depression.

      Mindfulness intervention has been shown to alleviate mental health issues including
      loneliness. However, to date, there is limited studies examining the effectiveness of a
      remote mindfulness intervention. This proposal aims to deliver a remote mindfulness program
      that can be accessible by participants easily and even during the isolation period. This
      intervention will investigate the effectiveness and safety in elevating mental health issues
      faced by the general population.

    <description>The content of the approximately 20 minutes video is recorded in advance of the intervention by a certified teacher with teaching experience. The 20 minutes session consists of a series of body stretching exercises (around 17 different gentle and simple stretches from head to toe) with the incorporation of breathing technique (i.e. when to breathe in and breathe out). The whole body stretching exercise is performed with a sitting position, ideally on an exercise mat. As mentioned above, the participants are required to conduct the stretching exercise by following the guidance video for at least 5 days weekly for at least 2 weeks duration. The video will be uploaded onto a webpage which requires participants to log in and view the video. The webpage and video will be accessible through computers and mobile phones.</description>
