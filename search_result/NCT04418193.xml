  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date no treatment has proven its effectiveness in the caring of patients infected with
      type 2 Coronavirus. The Centre Hospitalier Princesse Grace (CHPG) has decided to only propose
      randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials to patients at the early and
      symptomatic stages of the disease. Data from the literature show in vitro results on the
      potential clinical benefit of some treatments such as chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine
      (HXCQ). Observational data suggest a potential benefit of this treatment alone or in
      combination with azithromycin (HXCQ + AZ). These data were advertised or led to a request
      from ambulatory medicine and patients to have access to these treatments despite their poor
      level of evidence. This leads to a decrease in the number of patients recruitable for
      clinical trials because they refuse the concept of control arms or they wish active treatment
      (CQ, HXCQ or HXCQ + AZ) from the start.

      In this context, we propose to conduct in parallel with randomized trials, a so-called
      &quot;patient preference&quot; protocol which, after patients information, gives them the choice,
      either to participate in the trial or to choose between treatment with HXCQ, treatment with
      HXCQ + AZ or standard of care without medication. The patients follow-up and the main
      endpoint will be the same under the patient preference protocol as for the randomized trial.

      The advantage of this approach is to offer a common follow-up to all patients, to take into
      account patients who refuse to participate in the clinical trial, to obtain external validity
      data, to reduce selection bias and to increase the heterogeneity of patients exposed to
      treatment options.

      The expected objective is to see if the patient preference protocol leads to observe the same
      effects as in the randomized trial.

      Conduct of the research

        -  Pre-selection / Recruitment It is proposed to participate in the study to patients who
           cannot or do not wish to participate in a randomized therapeutic trial.

        -  Inclusion procedure During the inclusion visit, if the patient meets the study selection
           criteria, the investigator delivers oral and written information and responds to any
           patient questions.

        -  Follow-up of people suitable for research

             1. Inclusion visit The treatment chosen by the patient is administered.
                Socio-demographic, history, clinical and biological data are collected.

             2. Visit on day 3 ± 1 Hydroxychloroquinemia is dosed.

             3. Visit on day 5 ± 1 A nasopharyngeal swab sample is collected during the routine
                visit. This sampling is only performed for patients for whom the diagnosis of
                COVID-19 has been made by RT-PCR.

             4. Visit on day 10 ± 1 A nasopharyngeal swab sample is collected during the routine
                visit. This sampling is only performed for patients for whom the diagnosis of
                COVID-19 has been made by RT-PCR. Hydroxychloroquinemia is dosed.

             5. Visit on day 14 A visit or a telephone call is made to gather the occurrence of
                clinical events of interest on day 14. The treatments received during the last 14
                days are collected.

             6. Visit on day 28 A visit or a telephone call is made to gather the occurrence of
                clinical events of interest on day 28.

      The treatments received during the last 14 days are collected.
