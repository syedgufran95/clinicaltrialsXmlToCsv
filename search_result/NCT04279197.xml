  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to previous studies, viral pneumonia can develop into pulmonary fibrosis, which can
      affect patients'lung function and even life health.This study aims to observe the efficacy
      and safety of Fuzheng Huayu Tablets in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis after COVID-19.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients with COVID-19 could suffered from the pulmonary dysfunction and/or fibrosis the
      recovery period, but there are no certain drugs or treatment to cope with this situation. Our
      previous studies indicated that Fuzheng Huayu tablets could regress the lung fibrosis induced
      by bleomycin in animals, and improve the pulmonary function in the patients with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease. Now we design this trial to carry out the clinical study in
      order to evaluate the effects of Fuzheng Huayu tablets on pulmonary fibrosis and/or pulmonary
      function injury in the recovery period of COVID-19 and expect to improve the prognosis.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical trial.It enrolls
      160 patients who had been diagnosed with COVID-19, but currently they are negative for viral
      testing and have developed pulmonary fibrosis or pulmonary dysfunction. They are randomly
      assigned into control group and experimental group. All patients are given basic treatment
      such as respiratory function rehabilitation training and vitamin C. The experimental group is
      given Fuzheng Huayu tablets, and the control group is given placebo. Each patient will be
      observed for 24 weeks and followed up for 8 weeks. The primary outcome for the trial is the
      improvement proportion of lung fibrosis judged by HRCT score. Secondary outcomes include
      six-minute walk distance, clinical symptoms score, oxygen saturation, quality of Life-BREF
      (QOL-BREF) Score, patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) Score, general anxiety disorder-7
      (GAD-7) score. The safety also be observed.
