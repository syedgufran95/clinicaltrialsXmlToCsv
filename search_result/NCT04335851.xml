      Both influenza and coronaviruses cause respiratory infections, which can lead to morbidity
      and mortality, especially in those who are immunocompromised or not immune to viruses (Zhu).
      Physical exercise has many effects on the human body, including the immune system. Moderate
      exercise appears to have a beneficial effect on immune function, which can protect against
      upper respiratory infections. Human being is a social entity by nature and social isolation
      can negatively affect individuals' psychology. There are many studies examining the effect of
      physical activity on the mental state of people. The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests
      individual protection measures such as establishing necessary hygienic conditions, ensuring
      social isolation and keeping immune system strong against the complications that may develop
      due to Coronavirus.Human being is a social entity by nature and social isolation can

      psychological improvements resulting from the increased levels of physical activity have also
      been proposed in the literature.Regular aerobic exercise and walking can not only improve the
      emotional state of the individuals, but may also affect the mental health by avoiding the

      Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new form of coronaviruses
      that emerged in 2019 and causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 is highly
      contagious. The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests individual protection measures such
      as establishing necessary hygienic conditions, ensuring social isolation and keeping immune
      system strong against the complications that may develop due to Coronavirus. Both influenza
      and coronaviruses cause respiratory infections, which can lead to morbidity and mortality,
      especially in those who are immunocompromised or not immune to viruses (Zhu). Physical

    <measure>World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire Bref</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The WHOQOL-BREF instrument comprises 26 items, which measure the following broad domains: physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment. Turkish version of WHOQoL- BREF will be used in the study.The WHOQOL-BREF produces a quality of life profile. It is possible to derive four domain scores. There are also two items that are examined separately: question 1 asks about an individual's overall perception of quality of life and question 2 asks about an individual's overall perception of their health. The four domain scores denote an individual's perception of quality of life in each particular domain. Domain scores are scaled in a positive direction (i.e. higher scores denote higher quality of life). The mean score of items within each domain is used to calculate the domain score.</description>

    <measure>Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity (RAPA) is an easy-to-use form which assesses both aerobic and strength &amp; flexibility exercise levels. Turkish version of RAPA will be used in the study. The RAPA questionnaire is based on a scale of 1-7 measuring the amount and intensity and duration of physical activity that a person does. A score of 5 or below signifies sub-optimal physical activity and that of 6 or above signifies optimal physical activity. The activities are divided into light, moderate and vigorous activities.</description>

    <measure>Global Rating of Change Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The effectiveness of the exercise will also be evaluated with the Global Rating of Change scale (GRC). GRC scales have short administration time, applicability to nearly all patient and healthy group. In the study -point scale will be used. It is ranging from -2 (very much worse), through 0 (unchanged) to +2 (much better).</description>

They will be asked to do exercise 3 days a week for 4 weeks by following the videos. The intensity and duration of the exercises will be gradually increased by therapists each week. Exercise follow-ups will be done over the phone and by asking individuals to keep an exercise diary.</description>
