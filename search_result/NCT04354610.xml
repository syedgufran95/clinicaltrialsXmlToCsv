    <textblock>
      The Nancy Cov-H-AKI: study is a prospective, non-randomized, monocenter study performed in
      patients hospitalised for either the severe or the critical form of Covid-19.

      The main objective of the Nancy Cov-H-AKI study is to evaluate the association of variations
      (from inclusion to 72H post-inclusion) of 5 blood-based cardio-vascular-renal biomarkers
      selected a priori, cardiac (NT-proBNP), coagulation (D-dimers), related to the renin
      angiotensin aldosterone system (ACE2) and renal (Penkid, and NGAL) with the appearance of
      acute kidney injury KDIGO grade 1 or higher OR cardiac injury in patients hospitalised for
      either the severe or the critical form of Covid-19

      Secondary objectives

      Evaluate the association of the concentrations at inclusion AND of the variations (between
      inclusion and 72H post-inclusion) of blood and urine cardiovascular-renal biomarkers of
      interest (selected a priori: cardiac (NT-proBNP, (bio)-Adrenomedullin), coagulation
      (D-dimers), linked to the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (renin, ACE2, Angiotensin 2),
      inflammatory (ceramides), oxidative stress, and renal (PENKID, cystatin C) and renal
      glomerulo-tubulopathy ( renal functional exploration in blood and urine, and AKI (blood
      (NGAL, KIM-1) and urinary (IGFBP7-TIMP2)) biomarkers, AND WITHOUT a priori by an analysis of
      184 blood protein biomarkers in connection with cardiovascular and inflammatory damage * )
      with the appearance of:

        1. AKI KDIGO grade 1 or higher or elevation of troponin &gt;99th percentile in hospitalisation
           (approach with AND without a priori)

        2. AKI KDIGO grade 1 or higher

        3. Elevation of troponin &gt;99th percentile in hospitalisation

        4. Elevated serum creatinine &gt;30% in hospital

        5. Chronic renal failure (eDFG &lt;60 ml / min / 1.73m2) three months after discharge from
           hospital

        6. Cardiovascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure,
           cardiovascular death) and mortality in hospital and at three months after discharge from
           hospital

        7. Considering future exploratory analyses (biological collection of plasma, serum, saliva,
           urine, viruses) (for example other OLINK panels) on the previous endpoints

             -  NGAL (Neutrophil Gelatinase Associated Lipocalin), Cystatin C, Kidney Injury
                Molecule-1 (Kim-1), ACE-2, renin, Brain-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP),
                Adrenomedullin, FGF (fibroblast growth factor-23 are all included in the 2 Olink
                panels &quot;CVDII&quot; (https://www.olink.com/products/cvd-ii-panel/: listing) and
