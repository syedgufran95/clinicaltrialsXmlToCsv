    <textblock>
      This phase III trial compares low dose whole lung radiation therapy to best supportive care
      plus physicians choice in treating patients with COVID-19 infection. Low dose whole lung
      radiation therapy may work better than the current best supportive care and physician's
      choice in improving patients' clinical status, the radiographic appearance of their lungs, or
      their laboratory blood tests.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Time to clinical recovery based on reducing the need of supplementary oxygenation in COVID
      19 patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate (1) clinical, (2) radiographic, and (3) immune marker response to
      whole-lung LDRT compared to best standard of care.

      II. Secondary clinical improvements will look at time to hospital discharge, prevention of
      ICU admissions, and overall survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients are blindly randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive best supportive care plus physician choice of treatment

      ARM II: Patients receive best supportive care plus LDRT (experimental arm).

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 14 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have had a positive test confirming the diagnosis of COVID-19

          -  Have had clinical signs of severe acute respiratory syndrome or pneumonia (dyspnea,
             cough, fever) that primary team feels like needs rescuing with treatments

          -  Have visible consolidations/ground glass opacities on chest imaging

          -  Requiring supplemental oxygen

          -  Willingness and ability of the subject to comply with scheduled visits,
             protocol-specified laboratory tests, other study procedures, and study restrictions

          -  Evidence of a signed informed consent/assent indicating that the subject is aware of
             the infectious nature of the disease and has been informed of the procedures to be
             followed, potential risks and discomforts, potential benefits, and other pertinent
             aspects of study participation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No use of disallowed medications prior to randomization: Remdesivir or whatever drug
             may have been approved as standard of care to treat COVID patients. After consenting
             and randomization, patient could get remdesivir and/or other approved standard of care
             treatments on the standard of care arm as physician's choice. However, they would not
             be allowed to receive this on the radiotherapy arm until interim analysis is completed
             (i.e., after the first 8 patients enrolled on both arms with at least 14 day
             follow-up. This would especially be the case, if we see a vast superiority of one arm
             over another for the primary endpoints, that puts patients at risks from obtaining the
             standard of care treatments) However, patient could recieve such therapy if they are
             mechanically ventilated.
