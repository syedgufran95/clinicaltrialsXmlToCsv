    <textblock>
      Given the high prevalence of COVID19 illness (both SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed and highly
      suspect cases) among healthcare workers (HCW) within the Montefiore Health System (MHS),
      hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) will be prescribed to healthcare workers who are at the highest risk
      for severe COVID19 illness.
