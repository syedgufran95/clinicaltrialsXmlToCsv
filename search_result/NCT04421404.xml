  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study assess the efficacy and safety of anti-SARS-CoV-2 convalescent
      plasma in hospitalized patients with acute respiratory symptoms up to 14 days after the onset
      of initial symptoms.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 50 eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either
      convalescent fresh frozen plasma (frozen within 8 hours of collection) of PF24 (frozen within
      24 hours) from blood donors who have recovered from COVID-19 containing antibodies to
      SARS-CoV-2 or control (standard fresh frozen plasma collected prior to 12/1/2019 or with
      documented negative SARS-CoV-2 antibody). Should additional anti-COVID agents (anti-viral
      and/or anti-inflammatory) become available for use as standard of care during implementation,
      the sample size will be recalculated and increased to account for the estimated impact that
      these agents may have on the reducing the progression to the primary endpoint of severe
      hypoxemia.

    <masking_description>Study investigators analyzing the data and participants will be blinded to the randomization. It may not be feasible to blind nursing staff to the treatment assignment to ensure proper ABO checking of the plasma unit at bedside per standard transfusion procedures, but every effort will be made to preserve blinding of the investigators, participant, and primary team providing care. An unblinded research assistant who is not involved in other aspects of the study will randomize the participant once enrolled. Randomization will be provided to an unblinded provider who is not part of the care team who will place the order for the plasma (CCP vs. control plasma) using a paper order that will not be part of the electronic medical record. The safety monitoring committee (SMC) will review study data, including unblinded data, to evaluate the safety, efficacy, study progress, and conduct of the study.</masking_description>

    <description>COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma (CCP) is a form of passive antibody therapy that involves the administration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to a susceptible individual for the purpose of preventing or treating the infectious disease it causes. Convalescent plasma for this trial will be obtained from Vitalant (or American Red Cross if necessary). Patients identified as having recovered from COVID-19 will serve as potential donors. Potential donors will be screened using an anti-SARS-CoV-2 serologic assay and antibody levels will be determined.</description>

          4. Pulmonary infiltrates on chest imaging

          5. Oxygenation of &lt;95% on room air

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Contraindication to transfusion due to inability to tolerate additional fluid, such as
             due to decompensated congestive heart failure

          2. Baseline requirement for oxygen supplementation prior to COVID-19 infection or use of
             positive pressure therapy for sleep disordered breathing

          3. Currently experiencing severe hypoxemic failure, as defined in study endpoints

          4. Prior receipt of plasma products, IVIG, or hyperimmune globulin within past 3 months

          5. Not currently enrolled another interventional clinical trial of COVID-19 treatment.

        Note: If taking medications with potential anti-COVID activity for the purpose of COVID-19
        treatment that do not yet have data to support efficacy, such as IL-6 antagonists, these
        medications must be stopped prior to enrollment. Receipt of current standard of care
        COVID-19 treatment, including remdesivir and dexamethasone is permitted and should be
        recorded as a concomitant medication.

        Note: Pregnancy is not exclusionary but will merit additional discussion of risks &amp;
        benefits in the context of ongoing pregnancy
