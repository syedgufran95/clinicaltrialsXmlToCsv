      This is a laboratory testing study using the SARS-Cov2 Virus IgG/IgM rapid test cassette
      Clungene test to determine the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies in subjects who have tested
      negative or positive for COVID-19. The study is observational and subjects will be assigned
      to one of two arms depending on the results of their nCOVID-19 test.
