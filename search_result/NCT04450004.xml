  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a randomized, partially-blinded, prime-boost, staggered dose-escalation
      Phase 1 study intended to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the
      Coronavirus-Like Particle COVID-19 Vaccine at three dose levels (3.75 µg, 7.5 µg, and 15 µg
      VLP) unadjuvanted or adjuvanted with either CpG 1018 or AS03 in healthy adults 18 to 55 years
      of age, who have been tested for the absence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

      At each dose level, the vaccine will initially be administered to a small number of subjects.
      Vaccination of the remaining subjects at the same dose level and the next higher vaccine dose
      level will be administered with approval of the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC).
      The same process will be followed for the second vaccine administration. All subjects will be
      followed for a period of six months after the second administration of the vaccine for safety
      and immunogenicity testing at the end of the follow-up period.
