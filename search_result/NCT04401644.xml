      Using Laser light to detect COVID 19 virus particles in deep throat swab / nasal swab
      samples.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will develop novel primers to detect single virus particles in patient
      samples. The method involves the absorption of light by single virus particles giving a
      specific pattern. The investigators will develop the device to create a microdroplet of
      carrier fluid that is run through the trial device. The investigators will develop novel
      binding receptors for preferential capture of Coronavirus.

      The investigators will review the results of the novel test against the standard diagnostic
      test and identify virus particles in test negative subjects.

      The investigators will isolate the viral rna in test negative subjects and perform sequencing
      to find novel mutations that are not detected by the current test.

    <ipd_description>During the trial, the investigators will store a list of participants and their unique trial number on a password protected file and computer in the Clinical Research Department. After the trial has completed, and when the data is stored or used, any information that could identify an individual participant will be removed or &quot;pseudonymised&quot;. A pseudonym is a unique identifier which does not reveal the participant's 'real world' identity.
Personal identifiable data will not be shared with any other outside organisation. The results of the tests will be shared with the collaborators using a unique trial number. Any remaining blood sample material will be frozen and stored as serum using the unique trial number in Musgrove Park Hospital's research laboratory.</ipd_description>
