      Purpose:

        -  To determine the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in tears

        -  To determine SARS-CoV-2 receptors in tear production system

      This is a prospective case series. NP swab and tear samples will be collected simultaneously
      from the confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients. The samples will be transferred to the lab
      for SARS-CoV-2 testing. The presence of absence of SARS-CoV-2 will be compared in tears
      versus NP swabs.

      The second part of the study is a histopathology examination series. Normal lacrimal gland
      and ocular surface tissue samples already stored at the UMN ocular pathology lab and Lion's
      Gift of Sight Eye Bank will be used for IHC staining for ACE2 and similar targets.

    <description>All patients aged 18 years and above who present to Fairview/UMN ERs or ICUs with confirmed or suspect COVID-19 based on the attending physician's judgment will be included.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Diagnostic Test</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Tear Collection</intervention_name>
    <description>A microcapillary tube will be placed at the corner of the eyelid so tears can be absorbed to the tube without causing any trauma. The tube will be placed in a transfer tube. Standard virus sampling swabs will be used to collect samples from the same patient's nasopharynx. RT-PCR will be run to determine virus yield in each sample.
For the second part of the study, IHC staining will be done on the existing ocular tissue pathology slides to detect the expression of ACE2 and other cell surface and intracellular receptors. The investigators will use existing UMN ocular pathology lab and Lion's Eye Bank tissue samples. These are banked tissue samples that were collected and examined previously and then the remaining tissue samples were stored.</description>
