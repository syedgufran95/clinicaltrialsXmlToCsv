  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to examine potential changes in children' and adolescents' dietary
      and lifestyle (physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep) habits during the quarantine
      that was implemented in Greece due to COVID-19. An online survey in a random sample of
      families across Greece was conducted. Parents self-reported their children's and their own
      dietary and lifestyle habits, as well as information about their sociodemographic status.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since December 2019, the world is facing a new disease (COVID-19), which is caused by the
      Coronavirus (Sars CoV-2). WHO declared the disease of COVID-19 as a pandemic in February
      2020. Since then, many countries around the world have imposed lockdown (quarantine at home),
      as the main measure to prevent the spreading of the disease. In Greece, the lockdown was
      officially imposed from March, 23rd, 2020. This unprecedented situation may have caused
      changes in adults' and children's dietary and lifestyle habits.

      Data were collected via an online survey consisting of 70 questions. Study participants were
      enrolled after signing an informed consent form. The questionnaire self-reported by
      volunteers (parents of children aged between 2-18 years old). The survey had 3 sections. The
      first section focused on participants' sociodemographic data (e.g. gender, age, city of
      residence and socioeconomic level). The second and third sections contained questions about
      the parents' (section 2) and their children's (section 3) dietary and lifestyle habits before
      and during quarantine.

      The scientific community raises concerns about the health implications that will be caused
      due to the COVID-19 lockdown. The results of this study are expected to shed light into
      children and adolescents, as well as their parents', changes in dietary and lifestyle
      behaviours and feed the development of effective strategies to prevent the adoption of
      unhealthy lifestyle behaviours and weight gain in the event of a second wave of COVID-19 in
      the coming months.
