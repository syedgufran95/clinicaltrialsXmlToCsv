  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date there is no brain imaging and olfactory data available in COVID-19 positive patients
      with anosmia. By describing the pathophysiological characteristics underlying the olfactory
      symptoms and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection, the study investigators wish to
      compare the MRI aspects obtained in COVID-19 patients with and without anosmia, in the
      absence of other underlying neurological disorders.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain mapping of COVID-19 patients with or without anosmia will allow better understanding of
      the mechanisms leading to the onset of these symptoms and will provide a pathophysiological
      basis for the therapeutic interventions to improve the clinical prognosis of affected
      patients.

      The study investigators hypothesize that in COVID-19 patients witch anosmia the brain mapping
      objectified by an MRI examination is modified and that there are functional abnormalities in
      the brain in these patients.
