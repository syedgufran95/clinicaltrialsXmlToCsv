  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is an emerging respiratory virus that causes
      pneumonia. WHO data reported admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) for 6% of patients,
      with a mortality rate reaching 45%. To date, apart from therapeutic trials, ICU management is
      symptomatic, based on organ failure support therapies. In the initial phase, the therapeutic
      management also includes empiric antimicrobial therapy (90% of patients, in accordance with
      LRTI guidelines (ATS 2019) and SRLF Guidelines (2020). One challenge for the ICU physicians
      is the timing for discontinuation of antimicrobial treatment, especially in case of shock or
      ARDS, considering that a substantial proportion of COVID-19 pneumonia patients may have
      pulmonary bacterial coinfection/superinfection. In order to avoid unnecessary prolonged
      antimicrobial therapy, and subsequent selective pressure, two tests could be combined in a
      personalized antibiotic strategy:

        -  Procalcitonin (PCT): PCT is a useful tool to guide antibiotics discontinuation in
           community-acquired pneumonia) and viral pneumonia (PMID24612487).

        -  Respiratory multiplex PCR FA-PPP (Biomérieux®): panel has been enlarged, including 8
           viruses and 18 bacteria (quantitative analysis). The turnaround time is short.
           Sensitivity is high (99%, PMID32179139). It may contribute, in combination with
           conventional tests, to accelerate and improve the microbiological diagnosis during
           severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

      The hypothesize of the study is that the combination of the mPCR FA-PPP and PCT could be used
      to reduce antibiotics exposure in patients with severe confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia, with a
      higher clinical efficacy and safety as compared with a conventional strategy.

      Inclusion (D0_H0) is performed in ICU as soon as possible, once the diagnosis of COVID-19
      pneumonia is confirmed. Therefore, inclusion might be performed either on ICU admission (if
      the COVID-19 pneumonia has been confirmed in the pre-ICU wards) or during the ICU stay (if
      the COVID-19 pneumonia was confirmed after ICU admission). Conventional microbiological
      investigations are left at the discretion of the physicians, and may include blood cultures,
      Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila urinary antigen assays, and a respiratory
      tract sample for Gram stain examination and 2 days-long culture (if not already done in the
      past 24 hours). Usual biology includes procalcitonin measurement. Empirical antimicrobial
      therapy combines a third-generation cephalosporin and a macrolide, or broader-spectrum
      antibiotics if risk factors for resistant bacteria are identified.

      Randomization is performed immediately after the inclusion.

        -  In the intervention arm, a broad panel respiratory Mpcr FA-PPP is performed on
           respiratory tract sample (tracheal aspirate, BAL or sputum), collected 12 hours after
           inclusion. An algorithm of early antibiotic adaptation and discontinuation, based on the
           microbiological results, including the mPCR FA-PPP results, and the procalcitonin values
           and kinetics will be used. This algorithm will be applied as soon as possible after
           inclusion, and repeated day after day until D7.

        -  In the control arm, the antimicrobial therapy is left at the discretion of the
           physicians, as in usual practice.

      Evaluation criteria are collected at hospital discharge or at D28, and D90. The vital status
      may be obtained by phone call at D28 (if the patient has been discharged before D28) and at
      D90.
