  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is now a leading cause of death among U.S. adults. In
      addition to profound respiratory and multi-organ failure, hypercoagulable states and venous
      thromboembolism (VTE) have been increasingly reported in patients with severe Covid-19. The
      aim of this study is evaluate the risk of VTE related to Covid-19 infection in a real-world
      community-based population.

      This is an observational study of adult (age ≥18 years) members enrolled in the Kaiser
      Permanente Northern California (KPNC) or Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC)
      integrated healthcare delivery systems during the time period January 1, 2020 through
      December 31, 2020, (representing the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic) and diagnosed with
      incident Covid-19. The outcomes will be incident VTE and all-cause death, assessed through
      March 2021. The primary comparison will be the risk of post-hospitalization VTE between
      patients with Covid-19 compared with matched controls. Next, the risk of VTE associated with
      key patient subgroups, including by severity of Covid-19 disease, will be described.
