  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol tests the safety and efficacy of a novel universal vaccine concept called
      &quot;allo-priming&quot; which is designed to protect elderly adults from progression of any type of
      viral infection, including possible protection against progression of the current outbreak of
      COVID-19 infection, and any future variants, strains, mutations of the causative SARS-CoV-2
      virus as well as protection from any future currently unknown newly emergent novel viruses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed Allo-Prime universal viral protection mechanism involves vaccination with a
      bioengineered living allogeneic cellular vaccine (AlloStim) derived from healthy blood
      donors. The vaccine is designed to create high titers of memory immune cells that are
      specific to the foreign antigens in the living cell vaccine. Upon encounter with any type of
      virus, these memory immune cells are activated and release cytokines including an immediate
      release of IFN-ϒ. This non-specific activation causes immune conditions similar to the
      conditions that occur in healthy younger patients that leads to rapid viral clearance and
      viral-specific memory immune response to clear infection and protect against recurrence.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females who are at least 65 years of age at time of enrollment

          2. Good general health *

          3. Clinical screening laboratory evaluations (white blood cell (WBC), hemoglobin (Hgb),
             platelets (PLTs), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), creatinine
             (Cr), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin (T. Bili), prothrombin time (PT),
             and partial thromboplastin time (PTT)) are within acceptable normal reference ranges
             at the clinical laboratory being used.

          4. Normal EKG

          5. Available for the duration of the study

          6. Peripheral veins suitable for blood draw

          7. Able to provide consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. History of autoimmune disease 2. Currently being treated for cancer (other than
             non-melanoma skin cancer) 3. History of COPD 4. Any clinical condition requiring
             systemic steroids or any current immunosuppressive therapy 5. HIV positive or any
             other type of immunodeficiency disorder 6. History of cardiac disease: congestive
             heart failure &gt; NYHA class 2; cardiac arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic therapy
             (beta blockers or Digoxin are permitted) 7. Uncontrolled hypertension defined as SBP
             ≥130 and/or DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg 8. Active clinically serious infections (&gt; grade 2 CTCAE)
             9. History of organ transplant or tissue allograft 10. Oral temperature ≥99.0 degrees
             Fahrenheit (37.2 degrees Celsius). 11. Pulse &lt; 60 or &gt;100 beats per minute. 12. Oxygen
             saturation &lt;96% 13. Uncontrolled concurrent serious medical or psychiatric illness 14.
             History of blood transfusion reactions 15. Receipt of any type of influenza vaccine
             within two weeks of planned first study drug injection (influenza vaccination after
             day 28 is permitted)

               -  As determined by medical history and physical examination to evaluate acute or
                  ongoing chronic medical diagnoses/conditions that have been present for at least
                  90 days, which would affect the assessment of safety of subjects. Chronic medical
                  diagnoses/conditions should be stable for the last 60 days (no hospitalizations,
                  emergency room (ER), or urgent care for condition or need for supplemental
                  oxygen). This includes no change in chronic prescription medication, dose, or
                  frequency as a result of deterioration of the chronic medical diagnosis/condition
                  in the 60 days before enrollment. Any prescription change that is due to change
                  of health care provider, insurance company, etc., or done for financial reasons,
                  and in the same class of medication, will not be considered a deviation of this
                  inclusion criterion. Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of
                  a disease outcome, as determined by the participating site principal investigator
                  (PI) or appropriate sub-investigator, will not be considered a deviation of this
                  inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn) medications
                  if, in the opinion of the participating site PI or appropriate sub-investigator,
                  they pose no additional risk to subject safety or assessment of reactogenicity
                  and immunogenicity, and do not indicate a worsening of medical
                  diagnosis/condition. Similarly, medication changes subsequent to enrollment and
                  study vaccination are acceptable provided the change was not precipitated by
                  deterioration in the chronic medical condition, and there is no anticipated
                  additional risk to the subject or interference with the evaluation of responses
                  to study vaccination.
