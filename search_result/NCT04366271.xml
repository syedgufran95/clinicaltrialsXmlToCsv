  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a viral disease that infects the lungs,
      producing flu-like symptoms. Elderly infected patients and/or those with co-morbidities may
      suffer from acute respiratory distress syndrome due to pneumonia (COVID-19 disease). Given
      the high transmission, this virus has spread in recent months from Wuhan (China) to the whole
      world, becoming a global emergency pandemic. The lack of curative treatment for this disease
      justifies the need to carry out clinical trials that provide quality evidence on treatment
      options. Given the pathophysiology of the disease, which involves an uncontrolled
      inflammatory response of alveolar cells, a treatment that attenuates the cytokine cascade
      could be key in rescuing the patient's lung tissue. Mesenchymal cells, due to their
      immunoregulatory potential and regenerative capacity, can be an effective treatment for
      patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

      In the present study we propose a therapy with undifferentiated allogeneic mesenchymal cells
      derived from umbilical cord tissue, a treatment whose safety has already been described in
      other clinical trials and that shows promising results in pilot studies carried out in China.
