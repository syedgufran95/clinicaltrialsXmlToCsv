  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since March 2020, SARS-CoV2 virus (nCoV19; COVID-19) is considered pandemic. Its high rate of
      spread and infection in the human population and the lack of effective and validated
      treatment have led the authorities of several countries to confine their populations to slow
      the spread of COVID-19. As part of the management of this health crisis, the screening of
      individuals is essential in order to isolate &quot;infected cases&quot;. These screening tests are
      currently performed on nasopharyngeal swabs using RT-PCR for the detection of viral RNA.
      Although sensitive and specific, these tests remain relatively long (2-5 hours), expensive
      and the strong international demand for nucleic extraction kits and enzymes are factors
      limiting the implementation of widespread screening (problem of supply of swabs, molecular
      biology consumables).

      In order to prevent the risks of a shortage of screening means, we propose to develop an
      innovative alternative strategy, PCR-free, based on the detection of specific protein
      signatures in human saliva by MALDI-TOF MS profiling. MALDI-TOF MS profiling is a method used
      in routine diagnostics by microbiology laboratories for the identification of microorganisms.
      MALDI-TOF MS profiling has been successfully used to classify individuals according to their
      infectious status (oral pathologies) based on the analysis of their saliva, but also as a
      tool for the identification of respiratory viruses from cell culture supernatants. In
      addition, we have expertise and skills in the field of MALDI-TOF MS profiling and have
      implemented new strategies to improve the quality of profiles and their analysis,
      particularly in the context of entomological and vector identification projects. Finally,
      recent Chinese studies have reported that COVID-19 was detectable in saliva by RT-PCR.

      The main objective of this study is to develop a test based on the MALDI-TOF profiling method
      to detect individuals infected with SARS-CoV2 from saliva sample.

    <time_frame>Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>The development of this test is based on machine learning techniques, which involve &quot;training&quot; a mathematical model, in which the results of the mass spectrometry analysis of saliva samples and clinical data will be used to determine the information needed to distinguish a saliva sample from a SARS-CoV2-infected participant from a healthy saliva sample.</description>

    <description>For each saliva sample, the status (&quot;correct&quot; or &quot;incorrect&quot;) of the classification of the sample (&quot;infected&quot; or &quot;not infected&quot;) by the test (MALDI-TOF MS profiling) will be determined. Then the rate of correct classification will be calculated. The test will be considered efficient when it has reached a correct classification rate of more than 95%.</description>
