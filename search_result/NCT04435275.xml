  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID virus is acquired through droplet and micro droplet transmission. Although
      healthcare workers must adhere to strict up-to-date clinical procedures to minimize exposure
      to the virus and avoid contamination, the assumption that everyone can precisely remember
      every step is improbable as many of these procedures are quite complex and involve multiple
      steps in stressful situations. Further the use of a trained safety officer to ensure
      adherence is not always feasible due to the ever growing demand of healthcare providers.
      Investigators propose to utilize the Amazon Alexa device and Alexa Skills application to
      develop a voice enabled virtual assistant to guide healthcare professionals through the exact
      steps of clinical procedures including the donning and doffing of PPE, intubation and
      extubation procedures.

      Methods A total of 10 staff anesthesiologists will be recruited to participate in phase 1 of
      the study to evaluate the utility and functionality of this VA device.

      A total of 40 healthcare professionals will be recruited to participate in phase 2 of the
      study. Anesthesia providers (staff and fellows), anesthesia assistants, respiratory
      assistants and operating room nurses will be randomized to receive instructional guidance by
      the VA on one test occasion and a human coach on another occasion. During this phase of the
      study, the effectiveness of this VA prototype will be compared with a trained human safety
      officer / coach in its ability to provide instructional guidance for 4 safety and clinical
      procedures: 1) proper donning of personal protective equipment (PPE); 2) doffing of PPE; 3)
      intubation (putting in a breathing tube) and 4) extubation (taking out a breathing tube).
