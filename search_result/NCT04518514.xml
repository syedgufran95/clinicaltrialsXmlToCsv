    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility, patient satisfaction and time saving
      of a telemedical risk assessment and preoperative evaluation for anesthesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The preanesthesia evaluation and risk assessment is conducted by an anesthesiologist prior to
      elective surgery. The physician assesses the patient´s medical records and specifies the
      individual preoperative procedure in order to minimize the perioperative risks. The on-site
      meeting is often connected with extended travel time and during the COVID-19 pandemic also
      with an increased infection risk for the patient. This project was initiated to reduce time
      efforts on patient site and to reduce possible infection risks. The TAPE-software turns every
      patients home into a remote facility allowing the physician to conduct the preanesthesia
      evaluation over distance.

    <measure>Feasibility (as defined below) of telemedical risk assessment and preoperative evaluation in anesthesiology as assessed by a questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>We focus on the feasibility of a telemedical risk assessment and preoperative evaluation in anesthesiology. We defined feasibility in our scenario as:
establishment of a video-audio-connection possible
complete assessment of the patients medical records possible
assessment of the individual perioperative risk possible
physician is put into the position to explain planned procedures and related risks
digital documentation possible
physician is put into the position to answer patient questions
physician can acquire all necessary information
digital signature on both sides possible
Those criteria will be assessed by our questionnaires. After preanesthesia evaluation the patient as well as the physician are asked to answer our online questionnaire (two different ones).</description>

    <measure>Patient acceptance of a telemedical preanesthesia evaluation as assessed by a questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>After preanesthesia evaluation the patient is asked to answer our online questionnaire. The questionnaire is partly based on a previously published study (Follmann et al., Technical Support by Smart Glasses During a Mass Casualty Incident: A Randomized Controlled Simulation Trial on Technically Assisted Triage and Telemedical App Use in Disaster Medicine, J Med Internet Res 2019;21(1):e11939).</description>

    <description>We aim to investigate patient satisfaction of a telemedical risk assessment and preoperative evaluation in anesthesiology prior to elective surgery. After preanesthesia evaluation the patient is asked to answer our online questionnaire.
