  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emergency general surgical care during the COVID-19 pandemic presents a unique set of
      considerations and challenges. Patients presenting with acute surgical conditions and
      concomitant COVID-19 infection have higher risk of mortality and morbidity. The investigators
      present their experience with COVID-19 positive patients presenting with acute surgical
      conditions and reviewed the implementation of a protocolized pathway to mitigate the impact
      of COVID-19 infection.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All COVID-19 positive patients who presented to the acute general surgical service over a
      2-month period were identified. Patient data including demographics, surgical diagnosis,
      mortality, morbidity and hospital length of stay was collected. Based on the investigators'
      early experience from the first patient, the investigators designed a protocolized
      institutional pathway which incorporated the risk of COVID-19 infection and urgency of
      operation.

        A propsective review was performed of all patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19
        infection who presented with acute general surgical conditions to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital
        (KTPH), in the period of 1st April 2020 to 31st May 2020. KTPH is a 795-bed regional
        general hospital in Singapore that serves approximately half a million people in the
        northern part of the city state. A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined by a positive
        result on a reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of a specimen
        collected on a nasopharyngeal swab. Patients underwent testing on admission if identified
        as high risk as per national guidelines, or upon developing respiratory symptoms during
        inpatient stay.
