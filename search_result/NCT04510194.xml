    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to:

        1. Determine whether metformin can reduce the severity of COVID-19 disease;

        2. Determine whether metformin can prevent symptomatic COVID-19 disease;

        3. Determine whether metformin can prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection (seroconversion of
           SARS-CoV2 antibody tests or PCR positivity)
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a rapidly spreading viral
      infection causing COVID-19 disease. There currently is no preventive or outpatient treatment
      therapy for Covid-19. While vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 has been promising, there may
      be reduced willingness among the public to receive a vaccine developed so quickly. The
      intervention is metformin, a biguanide, administered in its immediate release formation,
      500mg twice daily.

    <measure>Dyspnea Assessment (PROMIS survey)</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Dyspnea (shortness of breath) item banks and pools assess self-reported Functional Limitations, Severity, Activity Motivation, Activity Requirements, Airborne Exposure, Assistant Devices Resources, Characteristics, Emotional Response, Task Avoidance and Time Extension as they related to dyspnea.
The 33-item Severity bank assesses the severity of difficulty breathing during various specific activities. Each activity is rated in terms of degree of dyspnea (0 = no shortness of breath, 1 = mildly short of breath, 2 = moderately short of breath, 3 = severely short of breath) while engaging in the activity over the past 7 days. Total scores range from 0 to 99 with higher scores reflecting greater levels of dyspnea during daily activity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Health Survey (PROMIS survey)</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Gobal-10 is a 10-item short-form survey measuring symptoms, functioning, and healthcare-related quality of life for a wide variety of chronic diseases and conditions.
Nine items are rated on a 5-point scale. Item 7 is rated on an 11-point scale and then transformed to a 5-point scale. Items 3, 6, 7, and 8 are scored in reverse. Item scores are summed to calculate a total raw score. Raw scores are then matched with a t-score using a scoring table. Outcome will be reported as t-score. T-scores range from 16.2 to 67.7 with higher scores indicating greater global health.</description>
