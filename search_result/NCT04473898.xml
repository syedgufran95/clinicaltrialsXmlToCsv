  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of telerehabilitation program on COVID-19
      symptoms, quality of life, level of depression, perception of dyspnea, sleep, fatigue,
      kinesiophobia and patient satisfaction in individuals diagnosed with COVID-19.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because of the risk of infection, telerehabilitation applications are recommended for
      patients with COVID-19. There are no studies in the literature evaluating the effectiveness
      of telerehabilitation program after COVID-19. In particular, the importance of the first
      eight weeks after the disease was emphasized.

      It is thought that the telerehabilitation program will improve the functional capacities and
      quality of life of patients in order to adapt to the daily life after the infection more
      easily, to cope with the symptoms brought about by the disease more easily and to prevent the
      respiratory distress, intensive care stay and inactivity due to muscle weakness.

    <intervention_model_description>It is planned to include 3 groups in the study. The group 1 will be informed about covid-19 and hygiene. Aerobic exercise will be offered to Group 2, aerobic exercise + breathing exercises will be offered to Group 3. The persons to be included in the groups will be determined randomly.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety and Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>It will be evaluated by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The questionnaire comprises seven questions for anxiety and seven questions for depression, and takes 2-5min to complete. Although the anxiety and depression questions are interspersed within the questionnaire, it is vital that these are scored separately. Cut-off scores are available for quantification, for example a score of 8 or more for anxiety. The increase in the score indicates the severity of anxiety and depression.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>It will be evaluated by Kinesiophobia Causes Scale. The questionnaire consist of 20 closed questions, assessed in a range from 0 to 100 - a higher score indicating a higher fear of movement</description>

    <measure>Patient Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks later</time_frame>
    <description>It will be evaluated by patient satisfaction scale. Likert scale questionnaire proposed seven dimensions of patient satisfaction directed toward their doctors. These are general satisfaction, technical quality, interpersonal manner, communication, financial aspects, time spent with doctor, and accessibility and convenience. Increased score indicates decreased satisfaction. The minimum score is 18, the maximum score is 90.</description>

    <measure>Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>It will be evaluated by Fatigue Severity Scale. A self-report scale of nine items about fatigue, its severity and how it affects certain activities. Answers are scored on a seven point scale where 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree. This means the minimum score possible is nine and the highest is 63.</description>
