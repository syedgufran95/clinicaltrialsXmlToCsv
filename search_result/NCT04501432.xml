  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in extraordinary public
      health orders of social distancing and self-isolation, leading to widespread disruption and
      discontinuation of cardiac rehabilitation programmes and other social opportunities for
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients to exercise. In Austria, the government initiated
      drastic public health measures on March 10, 2020, closing all outpatient cardiac
      rehabilitation facilities and restricting inpatient rehabilitation to patients with urgent
      medical indications only.

      This study aims to explore the impact of COVID-19-related national lockdown and public health
      restrictions on cardiac rehabilitation patients, with respect to maintenance of physical
      activity for secondary CVD prevention.

      The study poses three research questions, which will be addressed in a mixed-methods study
      with sequential quantitative-qualitative (QUANT-QUAL) design:

        1. What was the impact of the COVID-19-related lockdown on patients' physical activity and
           physical fitness levels? (QUANT stage)

        2. What was the patient experience of the closure of group-based cardiac rehabilitation
           training due to COVID-19 public health restrictions? (QUAL stage)

        3. Which insights and learning points may be drawn from patients' experiences during
           COVID-19 public health restrictions with respect to the provision of home-based digital
           support for physical activity? (QUAL stage)

      The study will recruit a cohort of up to 40 cardiac rehabilitation patients from one
      outpatient cardiac rehabilitation centre in Salzburg, Austria, whose rehabilitation programme
      was interrupted by COVID-19 public health orders, including &quot;lockdown&quot;.

      Patients will undergo re-assessment of physical fitness in cycle ergometry test and
      re-assessment of cardiovascular risk profile. This will be compared with patients' most
      recent available test results from before the COVID-19 lockdown (i.e. prior to mid-March
      2020) from patient records. Additionally, patients will take part in a semi-structured
      qualitative interview in which they will be invited to reflect on their personal experiences
      during the COVID-19 lockdown and thereafter.
