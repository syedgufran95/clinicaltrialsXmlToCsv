  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the new COVID-19 pandemic physicians all over the world have faced different
      challenges .Oxidative stress is a probable cause of multi organ failure in this setting which
      never has been evaluated in COVID-19 infection to the best of knowledge.Present study aimed
      to evaluate oxidative stress marker and redox system status in different COVID-19 patients
      regarding the severity of involvement.

      Oxidative stress is a probable cause of multi organ failure in this setting which never has
      been evaluated in COVID-19 infection to the best of knowledge.Present study aimed to evaluate
      oxidative stress marker and redox system status in different COVID-19 patients regarding the
      severity of involvement. Demographic and lab data of 60 COVID-19 confirmed positive cases
      gathered .These patients divided in to two arms: 1- severe COVID-19 which were intubated or
      admitted in intensive care unit due to severe hypoxia 2- non-severe COVID-19 patients which
      were not hypoxic and admitted in ward with no need to invasive oxygenation. All patients had
      positive RT-PCR positive nasopharyngeal swab results for COVID-19 or Lung CT scan compatible
      with COVID-19. Malondialdehyde(MDA) , Biopterin, Neopterin, SOD, Glutathione levels would be
      checked by ELISA tests and compared between these two groups and healthy controls.
