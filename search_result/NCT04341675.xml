  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of our study is to determine if treatment with sirolimus can improve
      clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The investigators will employ a
      randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study design. 30 subjects will be randomized in
      a 2:1 fashion to receive sirolimus or placebo. Sirolimus will be given as a 6mg oral loading
      dose on day 1 followed by 2mg daily for a maximum treatment duration of 14 days or until
      hospital discharge, whichever happens sooner. Chart reviews will be conducted daily to
      determine changes in clinical status, concomitant medications and laboratory parameters.
      Study specific biomarkers will be measured at baseline and then at days 3, 7 and 14.
