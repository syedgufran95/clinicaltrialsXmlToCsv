  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this research study is to test the safety and effectiveness of an
      investigational drug peginterferon lambda-1a in treating COVID-19.

      Primary Objective: Determine efficacy of pegylated interferon lambda as measured by clinical
      improvement. This will be defined as improvement in supplemental oxygen requirement.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Determine safety and tolerability of pegylated interferon lambda

        -  Days with fever

        -  Time to resolution of fever

        -  Rate of progression to requiring critical care

        -  Overall survival

        -  Time to discharge

      Exploratory Objectives: Determining the effect systemically on inflammatory markers in the
      blood, as well as viral load.

      Diagnosis and Main Inclusion Criteria: Patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of infection
      with SARS-CoV-2 and be receiving supplemental oxygen. Many patients may be receiving
      hydroxychloroquine with or without other antimicrobials.
