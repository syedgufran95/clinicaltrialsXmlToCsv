      This is a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the safety and
      efficacy of STI-5656 (Abivertinib Maleate) in subjects hospitalized due to COVID-19 in
      Brazil. Subjects are randomized 3:1 STI-5656 to placebo. Subjects receive either 100 mg of
      STI-5656 or placebo daily for 7 days. Standard of care will be maintained for all subjects
      throughout the study.
