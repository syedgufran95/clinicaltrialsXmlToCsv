  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current infection with the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is an exceptional health
      situation which requires an adaptation of our management practices in gynecological oncology.
      Data from the literature suggest that infection with Coronavirus is serious in subjects with
      cancer with a risk of severe form 5 times higher than that of the population without cancer
      and a risk of death multiplied by 8. In addition, the risk of infection would be 3 times
      greater in case of cancer. Faced with the COVID-19 epidemic, the investigator must organize
      themselves to ensure continuity in the treatment of patients with gynecological cancer but
      also adapt our practices in the management (CPR, teleconsultation, adaptation of treatment or
      even postponement of treatment). The objective of the High Council of Public Health is to be
      able to ensure adequate oncological care avoiding any potential loss of chance concerning the
      care of cancer: people affected must, despite the pandemic, have care allowing the same level
      of curability (localized cancers) or the same life expectancy (advanced cancers). This must
      be done by limiting as much as possible the impact on the organization of the service, the
      organization of patient follow-up and the psychological impact that these possible
      modifications could have. The hypotheses of our study are that the exceptional health
      situation linked to this pandemic leads to a change in the care of patients with
      gynecological cancer associated with a psychological impact and increased anxiety of patients
      during their care. Despite the extent of the pandemic, very little existing data makes it
      possible to define recommendations with a sufficient level of evidence.
