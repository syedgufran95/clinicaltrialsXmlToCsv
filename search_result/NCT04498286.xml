      Rationale: Patients with MS are possibly more vulnerable to infection with SARS-CoV-2.
      Furthermore the use of immunomodulatory treatment could have an effect on the course of
      COVID-19 disease. This has resulted in an alteration of current immunomodulatory treatment
      strategies and delaying the start of certain medications, which could induce MS disease
      activity. However, certain immunomodulatory treatments are also hypothesized to have a
      positive effect on COVID-19 disease. Besides lack of information regarding the effects of MS
      treatments on COVID-19, there is significant uncertainty in how we should advise MS patients
      in terms of self-isolation, resulting in many patients staying at home reluctant to perform
      their work or other daily activities. Nationally and locally, we are collecting information
      regarding COVID-19 in MS patients but numbers are low and only those who are severely
      affected are tested. Furthermore, there is no information regarding SARS-CoV-2 immunity in MS
      patients, which could be affected by certain MS treatments. Consequently, there is an urgent
      need for reliable information about infection rates/immunity and course of COVID-19 in
      relation to MS characteristics and treatments.

      Objectives: The objectives of this study are 1. to study the course of COVID-19 in MS
      patients in relation to immunomodulatory treatment and other patient and MS characteristics
      and 2. to study the proportion of MS patients with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and 3. to establish
      the antibody profile in positive tested patients and 4. to study the longitudinal course of
      these antibody profiles in positive tested patients.

      Study design: This is a mono-center cohort study in patients of the MS Center Amsterdam.

      Study population: All patients with a diagnosis of MS currently under follow-up in the
      Amsterdam MS Center.

      Intervention (if applicable): Single venous puncture for drawing blood and questionnaire. For
      a minority of patients (max 25%) who test positive for antibodies we will draw blood a again
      with questionnaires after six and twelve months.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Course of COVID-19 in MS patients in relation to MS
      immunomodulatory treatment.
