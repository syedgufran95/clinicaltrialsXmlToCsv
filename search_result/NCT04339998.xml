      Specific Aims:

        1. The investigators will prospectively evaluate and analyze changes in the appearance of
           the lungs and heart through serial acquisition of focused point-of-care ultrasound
           images in a cohort of patients with or under investigation for COVID-19.

        2. The investigators will correlate changes noted in ultrasound with clinical course and
           diagnostic evaluation to ascertain whether changes on ultrasound could improve care
           through earlier diagnosis or identification of patients at high risk of disease
           progression.

      The investigators will perform a descriptive study aimed at identifying the cardiopulmonary
      ultrasound features in patients with or under investigation for COVID-19.

      The study will take place at two sites: University of Minnesota Medical Center (UMMC) and
      Bethesda Hospital. At UMMC, a tertiary care center, clinicians will recruit and evaluate
      patients with or under investigation for COVID-19. At Bethesda clinicians will recruit and
      evaluate patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 as demonstrated by a positive
      PT-PCR.

      POCUS exams will be performed in a cohort of 200-500 patients with or under investigation for
      COVID-19. Serial ultrasound examinations will be performed every 48-72 hours until discharge,
      death, or study completion. Participants will undergo POCUS at enrollment by their treating
      physicians. Inquiry into study enrollment will be performed over the phone rather than in
      person, given the current scarcity of PPE and the added use that would occur with in-person
      enrollment.
