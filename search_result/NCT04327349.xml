  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020 by the
      World Health Organization. The virus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is easily transmitted
      through person to person and there is still no specific approach against the disease and
      mortality rate in severe cases is also significant. Therefore, finding effective treatment
      for the mortality of these patients is very important. In this study the investigators aim to
      determine the effect of Convalescent Plasma on COVID-19 patients Outcome through a Clinical
      Trial
