      SARS-Cov2 is an emerging respiratory virus in the coronavirus family, responsible of the
      pandemic since November 2019. France, which has more than 17,000 deaths from the virus, is
      one of the main outbreaks. As of 16 April 2020, more than 76,000 individuals in France have
      been hospitalized, corresponding to 69% of confirmed cases
      (https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr).

      Most affected patients have more or less marked clinical signs associating fever, cough,
      dyspnea, myalgia, anosmia, ageusia, digestive disorders. In some cases, the progression is
      worse with lung disease of varying severity. Indications for hospitalization are essentially
      the severe forms of Covid-19 disease, characterized by hypoxemic lung disease.

      Risk factors for developing severe Covid-19 disease have been identified already: age,
      co-morbidity such as diabetes, obesity-overweight or cardiovascular diseases. It is assumed
      that other host-related factors, including genetics, may contribute to the existence of this
      phenotypic heterogeneity. At present, these factors are not known.

      The objective of this research is to constitute a DNA collection from patients with Covid-19,
      in order to be able to search for genetic factors modulating the clinical phenotype.
