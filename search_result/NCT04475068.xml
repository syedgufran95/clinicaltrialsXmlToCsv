  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if a postural recruitment maneuver (PRM) improves
      the aeration and distribution of lung ventilation in patients with Acute Respiratory Distress
      Syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19 infection; without the need to reach high airway pressures
      as in the standard lung recruitment maneuver and / or place the patient in prone position.
      This strategy could be particularly useful in the context of a major health emergency in
      centers with limited resources.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PRM is based on the known effect of gravity on transpulmonary pressure (PL). Two
      principles explain its mechanism of action: 1) the first indicates that atelectasis and
      poorly ventilated areas of the lung can improve their aeration by putting the lung in the
      highest position. Opposite lateral decubitus causes that upper lung to have a higher PL and
      allow a recruiting effect at moderate airway pressures. 2) The second principle is based on
      Laplace's Law and postulates that once the upper lung is recruited, it remains without lung
      collapse if a sufficient level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is applied. Based
      on these two precepts, PRM consists of sequentially moving the patient from the supine to the
      left lateral decubitus to recover the aeration of the right lung. After that, the patient is
      placed in the right lateral position to recruit the left lung; keeping the right lung without
      collapse by continuous use of PEEP. Finally, the patient returns to the supine position
      looking for an improvement in the distribution of ventilation and global pulmonary aeration,
      with a subsequent improvement in gas exchange and pulmonary mechanics.

    <description>Prior to initiating the protocol, patients will be sedated deeply with sedatives and opioids and paralyzed. Patients will be evaluated in 5 positions sequentially: 1) Supine 2) Left lateral 3) Supine 4) Right lateral 5) Supine. The side with the least ventilation evaluated by EIT will define which side will start the sequence. Each step will last 30 minutes. Aeration measured by Electric Impedance Tomography (EIT) and lung ultrasound, distribution of the lung ventilation and perfusion measured by EIT, ventilator and hemodynamic parameters, esophageal pressure, and blood gas analysis will be recorded at the end of each step. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate and saturation of arterial blood (SpO2) will be carried out during all steps of the protocol to assess the tolerance to the procedure.</description>
