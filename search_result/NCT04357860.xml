  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early administration of sarilumab in hospitalized patients infected with COVID-19 who have
      pulmonary infiltrates and are at high risk of unfavorable evolution could decrease/prevent
      progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring high flow nasal
      oxygenation (HFNO) or either invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation.
