    <textblock>
      CT-P59 is a monoclonal antibody targeted against SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD as a treatment for SARS
      CoV 2 infection. CT-P59 is currently being developed by the Sponsor as a potential treatment
      for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of CT-P59
      will be evaluated in healthy subjects.
