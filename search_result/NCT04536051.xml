      There will be 2 study groups and an anticipated enrolment of 5000 health professionals and
      adults with high potential for exposure to SARS-CoV-2, aged ≥18 years.

      All subjects will undergo follow-up for a total of 1 year post last vaccination. Additional
      visits or procedures may be performed at the discretion of the investigators, e.g., further
      medical history and physical examination, or additional blood tests and other investigations
      if clinically relevant
