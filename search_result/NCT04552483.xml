      SARITA-2 is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel, -blinded,
      interventional, treatment clinical trial with two arms, which aims to study the impact of
      nitazoxanide in the early phase of the COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-19).

      Experimental group: 196 patients received nitazoxanide 500mg 8 / 8 hours for 5 days. Control
      group: 196 patients received placebo 8/8 hours for 5 days.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 will be randomly divided into 2 groups: experimental and control groups.
Experimental group: 196 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR will receive nitazoxanide 500mg 8/8 hs for 5 days. Control group: 196 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR will receive placebo 8/8 hs for 5 days.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Patients were randomly allocated into one of the two groups: A or B. Patients received labelled medication: A or B, by the pharmacist.
