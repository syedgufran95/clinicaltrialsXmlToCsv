  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of COVID-19 cases has been growing exponentially, so that the industrialized
      economies are facing a significant shortage in the number of ventilators available to meet
      the demands imposed by the disease. Noninvasive ventilatory support can be valuable for
      certain patients, avoiding tracheal intubation and its complications. However, non-invasive
      techniques have a high potential to generate aerosols during their implementation, especially
      when masks are used in which it is virtually impossible to completely prevent air leakage and
      the dispersion of aerosols with viral particles. In this context, a helmet-like interface
      system with complete sealing and respiratory isolation of the patient's head can allow the
      application of ventilatory support without intubation and with safety and comfort for
      healthcare professionals and patients. This type of device is not accessible in Brazil, nor
      is it available for immediate import, requiring the development of a national product.
      Meanwhile, a task force under the coordination of the School of Public Health (ESP) and
      Fundação Cearense de Apoio à Pesquisa (FUNCAP), with support from SENAI / FIEC and the
      Federal Universities of Ceará (UFC) and the University of Fortaleza (UNIFOR) advanced in the
      development of a prototype and accessory system capable of providing airway pressurization
      through a helmet-type interface, which was called the Elmo System.

      Objectives: 1. Validate the functionalities to fulfill the requirements and evaluate the
      usability of the Elmo System and 2. Evaluate the effectiveness of the Elmo system in the
      treatment of support to patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure caused by COVID-19.

      Methods: This is a study divided into two stages. For objective 1, tests will be carried out
      on healthy volunteers using prototypes of the Elmo system and assessing whether their
      effectiveness in providing positive airway pressure and their usability from the perspective
      of their primary users (doctor, physiotherapist and nurses) and the comfort of the volunteer.
      After the tests to meet the requirements: continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) offer,
      guarantee of the maintenance of alveolar ventilation without carbon dioxide (CO2)
      rebreathing, monitoring of intra-ELMO pressure, minimization of the adverse effects of the
      system such as noise, face temperature, dryness of the airways and overall comfort . In
      addition, realistic simulations will be carried out, centered on the assessment based on
      heuristic principles by a multiprofessional team with experience in mechanical ventilation,
      to assess the performance of the new equipment in the execution of the pre-defined skills.
      The second phase will consist of a clinical trial with application of the Elmo System to 10
      patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure by COVID-19, to evaluate its effectiveness,
      through the analysis of physiological variables and patient comfort, as well as their
      clinical outcomes (need for tracheal intubation) and Insuf recovery time. Resp. Hypoxemic and
      need for O2 in a referral hospital for the treatment of this condition in Fortaleza / Ceara.
