  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the antihelmintic drug, Niclosamide, as a potential treatment for
      mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Niclosamide, which has potent antiviral activity against single-stranded RNA viruses
      including coronaviruses, was proposed as an antiviral during the Severe Acute Respiratory
      Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002 and has activity including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
      Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) where it was found to inhibit SARS coronavirus, SARS-CoV, in in
      vitro studies and similarly structured RNA viruses (both in vitro and in vivo). The
      investigators hypothesize that the antiviral activity of Niclosamide may be extended to
      COVID-19.

    <description>Participants in the treatment arm will receive Niclosamide 2 grams orally once daily for 7 days in addition to current standard of care treatment. Oropharyngeal swab samples will be collected for viral shedding as measured by PCR on days 3, 7, 10, 14. Fecal samples will be collected for viral shedding as measured by PCR on days 3, 7, 10, 14, 21. A baseline fecal and oropharyngeal sample will be obtained on Day 1 prior to starting dosing of Niclosamide/ placebo.</description>

    <description>In addition to Niclosamide or placebo treatments, all enrolled patients will be provided a home thermometer as well as a fingertip probe pulse oximeter, with the specific instructions to monitor both temperature at oxygen saturation at the time of daily oral administration of drug. The collection of oropharyngeal samples will be directly observed by a Study Team member via the telehealth platform.</description>
