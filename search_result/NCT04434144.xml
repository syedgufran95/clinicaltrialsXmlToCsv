  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID19 is a worldwide pandemic. Hence SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus; there is no specific
      medication against it. Like other countries of the world, Bangladesh is also struggling in
      the case of treatment of this disease. Besides antiviral drugs other existing drugs like
      Hydroxychloroquine, Chloroquine, and recently Ivermectin has been used for the treatment of
      mild to moderate cases of COVID19 disease. Till now Hydroxychloroquine has shown a good
      effect. Recently anti-parasitic drug Ivermectin was found highly effective in an in-vitro
      study against SARS-CoV-2. This study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Ivermectin and
      Hydroxychloroquine as a combination therapy with antibiotics (Doxycyclin and Azithromycin)
      and compare the recovery period of these two drugs applied as core monotherapy.

      This study was done from May 2nd to June 5th, 2020. The investigators included 181 patients
      who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT PCR presented and the sample
      collected at Chokoria Upazila Health Complex, Cox's Bazar; Bangladesh. The PCR analysis of
      the collected sample was done at Cox's Bazar Medical College. Each of the participants was
      examined carefully to find out the details of the disease symptoms, history, comorbid
      condition, and associated complaints. Patients with severe comorbid conditions like severe
      Bronchial asthma, COPD exacerbation, severe ischemic heart disease, uncontrolled diabetes
      mellitus, advanced renal and hepatic disease, carcinoma, hospitalized and Immuno-compromised
      patients were not included in this study. 42 patients had comorbid conditions (some required
      hospitalization) that might affect the recovery time; 14 patients were unwilling to
      participate in the study and 9 participants did not show-up (3 from group A and 6 from group
      B) for follow up sample collection so these were excluded. Following exclusion 116 patients
      were included with mild to moderate degree of illness with normal or near-normal chest
      radiograph and Oxygen Saturation more than 95% were included in this study. All the patients
      enrolled in the study were treated as an outpatient protocol.

      For the study Perouse the participants were divided into two groups as follows:

      Group A (n=60): Ivermectin 200µgm/kg single dose + Doxycycline 100mg BID for 10days.

      Group B (n=56): Hydroxychloroquine 400mg first day then 200mg BID for 9days + Azithromycin
      500mg daily for 5Days.

      Besides the above, symptomatic treatment for fever, headache, cough, myalgia, and other
      complaints were given accordingly. Participants were advised for self-isolation, proper
      nutrition, hydration, and a sanitary environment. Treatment outcomes were evaluated on every
      2days starting from the 5th day (Asymptomatic patients) or the 2nd non-symptomatic day from
      the first day of the drug intake by PCR study of nasopharyngeal and throat swab in each
      group. Regular contacts were maintained to find out the adverse or side effects of the
      therapy. Informed consent was obtained in every case.

    <description>Treatment outcomes of the COVID19 positive participants will be evaluated on the 5th day in case of an asymptomatic participant; in case of the symptomatic participant, on the 2nd non-symptomatic day onward from the first day of the drug intake by PCR study of nasopharyngeal and throat swab. In the case of still positive PCR, the swab will be collected from the participants after every 2days until the status is negative. A negative PCR is a count of treatment success in each case. The duration (in days) from the first day of drug intake to the negative PCR is the recovery period. Participants who require hospitalization or decease due to the disease progression during the treatment will count as treatment failure.</description>
