  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since December 2019, the emergence of a new coronavirus named SARS-Cov-2 in the city of Wuhan
      in China has been responsible for a major epidemic of respiratory infections, including
      severe pneumonia. Within weeks, COVID-19 became a pandemic.

      In the absence of specific antiviral treatment, a special attention should be given to
      prevention. Personal protection equipments may be insufficiently protective, including in
      healthcare workers, a significant proportion of whom (around 4%) having been infected in the
      outbreaks described in China and more recently in Italy. Infection in healthcare workers
      could result from the contact with COVID-19 people in community or with infected colleagues
      or patients.

      As it will take at least a year before vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 becomes available,
      chemoprophylaxis is an option that should be considered in this setting where prevention of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection in Health Care Workers.

      The COVIDAXIS trial evaluates a chemoprophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Health Care
      Workers. This trial is divided into two distinct studies that could start independently each
      with its own randomization process: COVIDAXIS 1 will study Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) versus
      placebo; COVIDAXIS 2 will study Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) versus placebo.

      Upon randomization healthcare workers (HCWs) involved in the management of suspected or
      confirmed COVID-19 cases will be assigned to one of the following 2 treatment groups:

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study COVIDAXIS 1(Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) versus placebo) will be realized on 600
      participants and will be implemented first in as many centers as possible.

      Upon randomization, with 1:1 allocation ratio, healthcare workers involved in the management
      of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases will be assigned to one of the following 2 treatment
      groups:

        -  Group 1.1: HCQ 200 mg : 2 tablets on the evening at Day 1 and 2 tablets on the morning
           at Day 2 and 1 tablet once daily afterwards

        -  Group 1.2: Placebo of HCQ, 2 tablets on the evening at Day 1 and 2 tablets on the
           morning at Day 2 and 1 tablet once daily afterwards.

      The COVIDAXIS 2 (Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) versus placebo will be realized on 600
      participants and will be implemented in already participating and newer centers in a second
      step (when LPV/r becomes available).

      Upon randomization, with 1:1 allocation ratio, healthcare workers involved in the management
      of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases will be assigned to one of the following 2 treatment
      groups:

        -  Group 2.1: LPV/r 200/50 mg : 2 tablets twice daily

        -  Group 2.2: Placebo of LPV/r, 2 tablets twice daily

      Participants will receive the randomized treatment for 2 months and will be followed upon a
      2.5 months period.

      NB: there is no randomization procedure for participant inclusion in either COVIDAXIS 1 or
      COVIDAXIS 2
