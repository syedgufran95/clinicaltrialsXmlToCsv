    <textblock>
      This meta-trial is a prospective collaborative individual participant data meta-analysis of
      randomised controlled trials and early phase studies. Individual studies will take place in
      multiple countries, including Australia, Ireland, the USA, Spain and the UK.

      Mechanically ventilated patients with confirmed or strongly suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection,
      hypoxaemia and an acute pulmonary opacity in at least one lung quadrant on chest X-ray, will
      be randomised to nebulised heparin 25,000 Units every 6 hours or standard care (open label
      studies) or placebo (blinded placebo controlled studies) for up to 10 days while mechanically
      ventilated. All trials will collect a minimum core dataset. The primary outcome for the
      meta-trial is the hierarchical composite endpoint the Alive and Ventilator Free Score at day
      28. Individual studies may have specific outcome measures in addition to the core set.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 years or older

          -  Currently in an intensive care unit (ICU) or scheduled for transfer to the ICU. During
             the pandemic, critically ill inpatients might be cared for outside of the walls of the
             usual physical environment of ICU. For this reason, ICU is defined as an area
             designated for inpatient care of the critically ill where therapies including invasive
             mechanical ventilation can be provided.

          -  Endotracheal tube in place

          -  Intubated yesterday or today

          -  PaO2 to FIO2 ratio less than or equal to 300 while intubated

          -  Acute opacities not fully explained by effusions, lobar/lung collapse and nodules,
             affecting at least one lung quadrant on chest X-ray or CT

          -  The acute opacities on chest X-ray or CT are most likely due to COVID-19

          -  There is a PCR positive sample for SARS-CoV-2 within the past 21 days or there are
             results pending or further testing is planned. The sample can be a nasal or pharyngeal
             swab, sputum, tracheal aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage, or another sample from the
             patient.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Enrolled in another clinical trial that is unapproved for co-enrolment

          -  Heparin allergy or heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia (HIT)

          -  APTT &gt; 120 seconds and this is not due to anticoagulant therapy

          -  Platelet count &lt; 20 x 109 per L

          -  Pulmonary bleeding, which is frank bleeding in the trachea, bronchi or lungs with
             repeated haemoptysis or requiring repeated suctioning

          -  Uncontrolled bleeding

          -  Pregnant or might be pregnant. Females aged 18-49 years are excluded unless there is
             documented menopause or hysterectomy or a pregnancy test was performed and is
             negative.

          -  Receiving or about to commence extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or high
             frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV)

          -  Myopathy, spinal cord injury, or nerve injury or disease with a likely prolonged
             incapacity to breathe independently e.g. Guillain-Barre syndrome

          -  Acute brain injury that may result in long-term disability

          -  Usually receives home oxygen

          -  Dependent on others for personal care due to physical or cognitive decline

          -  Death is imminent or inevitable within 24 hours

          -  The clinical team would not be able to set up the study nebuliser and ventilator
             circuit as required including with active humidification

          -  Clinician objection

          -  Refusal of participant (person responsible) consent.
