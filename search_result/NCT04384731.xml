  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surfactant replacement therapy (SRT) improves oxygenation and survival in NRDS and some
      infant ARDS. SRT was tried in adult ARDS with conflicting results. Research by Filoche and
      Grotberg helped to understand the failure of previous clinical trials and yielded a strong
      scientific rationale for SRT success, now allowing to design a new administration protocol
      for SRT in adults, to be tested by this clinical trial in COVID-19 adult ARDS patients.

      Patients will be randomized to receive either a bronchial fibroscopy alone (with aspiration
      of secretions) or a bronchial fibroscopy with administration of 3 mL/kg of a solution of
      poractant alpha diluted to 16 mg/mL and distributed into each of the 5 lobar bronchi.
