  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emerging in China in December 2019, Covid-19, whose pathogen is SARS-Cov-2, was declared a
      global pandemic in March 2020. The clinical presentation is highly variable, ranging from
      asymptomatic forms to acute respiratory distress and even death. Transmission is by droplet
      route, with an R0 of approximately 3.

      Rapidly, population protection measures were put in place by governments, including the
      confinement of all persons whose functions were not considered essential and the closure of
      educational institutions.

      Health care institutions are places at risk of Covid-19 transmission and hospital staff are
      particularly exposed, either through direct contact with patients, contact with exposed
      persons or through the environment. In order to protect personnel, hygiene measures were
      immediately recalled and reinforced.

      During the period of containment, the majority of students from the Lyon-Bron Military
      Medical Schools were sent as reinforcement in Army Training Hospitals and in the Military
      Reanimation Unit (Mulhouse). Some students developed symptomatic forms of SARS-Cov-2
      infection, documented by positive PCR, during Operation Resilience or on their return from
      the mission.

      The Lyon-Bron Military Medical Schools staff, exposed both to the initial phase of the
      epidemic and to national protection measures, represent an extremely interesting population
      for understanding the epidemiological dynamics of the virus.
