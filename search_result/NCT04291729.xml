      Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of Ganovo combined with ritonavir for patients infected
      with SARS-CoV-2.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given no specific antiviral therapies for new coronavirus pneumonia approved yet and Ganovo,
      an oral Hepatitis C virus protease inhibitor, approved in China in June 2018 , this open,
      controlled trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ganovo in hospitalized patients
      infected with SARS-CoV-2.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged 18-75 years old;

          -  Pneumonia patients with new coronavirus infection were confirmed to be positive by
             RT-PCR and clinical manifestations. The diagnosis standard refers to the diagnosis and
             treatment plan for pneumonia with new coronavirus infection (Current Trial Version);

          -  Patients with newly diagnosed respiratory system discomfort who have been hospitalized
             (the diagnosis time of respiratory system discomfort shall not exceed 7 days);

          -  Women and their partners who have no planned pregnancy for nearly half a year and are
             willing to take effective contraceptive measures within 30 days from the first
             administration of the study drug to the last administration;

          -  Agree not to participate in other clinical research within 30 days from the first
             administration of the study drug to the last administration;

          -  Patients who voluntarily sign informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The pneumonia patients with severe new coronavirus infection met one of the following
             conditions: respiratory distress, RR &gt;= 30 times / min; or SaO2 / SpO2 &lt;93% in resting
             state; or arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / concentration of oxygen (FiO2)
             &lt;300MMHG (1mmhg = 0.133kpa);

          -  Pneumonia patients with severe new coronavirus infection meet one of the following
             conditions: respiratory failure and need mechanical ventilation; or shock; or other
             organ failure combined with ICU monitoring treatment;

          -  Severe liver disease (such as child Pugh score &gt;=C, AST &gt; 5 times upper limit);

          -  Patients with contraindications specified in the instructions of ritonavir tablets;

          -  The pregnancy test of female subjects in the screening period was positive;

          -  The researchers judged that it was not suitable to participate in this clinical trial
             (for example, patients who may be transferred to another hospital during the study
             period; patients with multiple basic diseases, etc.).
