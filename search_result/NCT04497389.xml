  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the effectiveness of processed human amniotic fluid
      as a treatment for COVID-19.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Past use of human amniotic products (i.e., membrane and fluid) has previously been
      FDA-approved as a human cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products (HCT/P) under
      21 CFR 1271 for tissue injury; and has been used to reduce inflammation and fibrosis in
      patients with a variety of ailments. Given this, the investigators hypothesize that
      intravenously (IV) administered processed sterile filtered amniotic fluid will reduce
      inflammation in COVID-19 patients, and improve secondary clinical outcomes. Specifically, the
      investigators hypothesize that patients who receive IV administered hAF will see a 50%
      reduction in mean C-reactive protein levels following treatment.
