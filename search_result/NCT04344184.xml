      This study will test to see if a 72-hour intravenous vitamin C infusion protocol (100 mg/kg
      every 8 hours) in patients with hypoxemia and suspected COVID-19 will reduce the lung injury
      caused by the SARS-Cov-2.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases was reported in Wuhan, China, and a novel
      coronavirus, SARS-Cov-2, was identified. The World Health Organization (WHO) designated the
      respiratory disease as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on February 12, 2020. Numerous reports
      have since characterized the COVID-19 clinical syndrome, ranging from asymptomatic/mild
      disease to severe disease leading to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation
      (i.e., ARDS, multi-organ failure, sepsis, and death).

      A safe, effective, and inexpensive therapy is urgently needed, one that can alter the natural
      course of the disease process and reduce strain on healthcare systems. High Dose Intravenous
      Vitamin C is a safe and possibly effective treatment for ARDS and has been described to be
      effective for ARDS of viral origin.

      A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized control trial involving 167 patients with ARDS
      who were randomized to receive 50 mg/kg every 6 hours of HDIVC for 4 days versus placebo
      showed a statistically significant difference in 28-day all-cause mortality. The 28-day
      mortality was 29.8% in the vitamin C group versus 46.3% in the placebo group, although this
      was a secondary outcome.

      This can be translated as a Number Needed to Treat (NNT) of 6-8 patients to save one life
      from ARDS. The statistical effect on mortality remained up to 60-days following trial
      completion.

      The first study, published in 1986, treated 16 ARDS patients with intravenous vitamin C (1000
      mg IV every 6 hours) plus antioxidants versus 16 ARDS patients who received the standard care
      at that time (i.e., control group). There was a reduction in mortality in the vitamin C
      group: 37% versus 71% in the standard care group (p&lt;0.01). A phase I trial in 2014 proved
      that plasma vitamin C in patients with severe sepsis and ARDS were low, almost at scorbutic
      levels and that HDIVC administration had a dose-dependent effect in the prevention of
      multi-organ failure, as measured by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores.

      Patients who received a total of 200 mg/kg/day of HDIVC for 4 days (administered in 50
      mg/kg/dose, every 6 hours), had significantly lower organ failure scores than placebo, and
      even lower scores than the patients who received lower-doses of IV vitamin C (50 mg/kg/day
      administered at 12.5 mg/kg/dose, every 6 hours for 4 days). In this trial, the patients in
      the HDIVC group (200 mg/kg/day) achieved plasma levels up to 3,000 ÂµM on day 4.

      To assess the treatment effect of a 72-hour intravenous vitamin C infusion protocol (100
      mg/kg every 8 hours) in patients with hypoxemia and suspected COVID-19 (Novel Coronavirus
      ID-19). In the course of performing this phase 2 trial researchers will explore three
      following hypotheses:

      Primary Endpoint: HDIVC infusion will increase 28-day ventilator-free days. Secondary
      Endpoint A: HDIVC infusion will reduce 28-day all-cause hospital mortality.

      Secondary Endpoint B: HDIVC infusion will significantly increase acute inflammation-free days
      (defined as CRP &gt;=10 mg/L) among COVID-19 patients.

      Secondary Endpoint C: HDIVC infusion will be safe, as demonstrated by organ-failure-free days
      up to 28 days.
