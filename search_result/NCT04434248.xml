  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is Phase II/III and consists of pilot and pivotal stages. The objective of the
      pilot stage is to conduct a preliminary assessment of the efficacy and safety of Favipiravir,
      and to select the optimal dosing regimen to study during the pivotal stage. The objective of
      the pivotal stage is to assess the efficacy and safety of Favipiravir compared with the
      Standard of care (SOC) in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

      At the pilot stage: upon signing the informed consent form and screening, 60 eligible
      patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia are randomized at
      a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either Favipiravir 1600 mg twice a day (BID) on Day 1 followed by
      600 mg BID on Days 2-14 (1600/600 mg), or Favipiravir 1800 mg BID on Day 1 followed by 800 mg
      BID on Days 2-14 (1800/800 mg), or SOC.

      At the pivotal stage: additional 270 eligible patients are randomized at a 1:1 ratio to
      receive either Favipiravir (the dose regimen depends of the subject's weight) or SOC.
