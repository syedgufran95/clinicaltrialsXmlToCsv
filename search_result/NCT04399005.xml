  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study was to evaluate the difference of effectiveness between daily and
      after-each-case room disinfection in the endoscopy unit during the COVID-19 pandemic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study divided into 2 groups: daily room disinfection and after-each-case room
      disinfection. Each group was also subdivided into general anesthesia or non-general
      anesthesia gastroscopy, and with or without ventilation consultation room.

      Samples collection include: operation unit air (six-stage sieve percussion air sampler for
      sampling, airflow rate 28.3L/min, sampling time 4 min); workstation's mouse (wiping sterile
      cotton for sampling); endoscopist's gown, control panel buttons, and patient's bed headboard
      (contact plate for sampling).

    <description>Room disinfection was defined as the cleansing and disinfection of the surface of the facility, endoscopist's gown, and air in the endoscopy room after the examination. Specifically, sanitizing wipes wiped the surface of the facility one by one, containing quaternary ammonium salt, alcohol, and interfacial activator; the air disinfection machine continued for 30min of air disinfection. Daily room disinfection was defined as disinfection after completing 8 non-general anesthesia gastroscopy or 4 general anesthesia gastroscopy.</description>
