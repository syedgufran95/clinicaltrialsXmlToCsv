  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if a high dose of IVIG plus SMT can reduce all-cause
      mortality versus SMT alone in hospitalized participants with COVID-19 requiring admission to
      the ICU through Day 29.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Hospitalized male or female subjects of ≥ 18 years of age at time of Screening who are
             being treated in the ICU for COVID-19 for not longer than 48 hours or for whom a
             decision has been made that COVID-19 disease severity warrants ICU admission.

          -  Has laboratory-confirmed novel coronavirus {SARS-CoV-2} infection as determined by
             qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (reverse transcriptase [RT]-PCR), or other
             United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved diagnostic assay for
             COVID-19 in any specimen during the current hospital admission prior to randomization.

          -  Illness (symptoms of COVID-19 of any duration requiring ICU level care), and the
             following:

               1. Radiographic infiltrates by imaging (chest X-Ray, computerized tomography (CT)
                  scan, etc.), and

               2. Requiring mechanical ventilation and/or supplemental oxygen.

          -  Any one of the following related to COVID-19: i. Ferritin &gt; 400 nanogram per
             milliliter (ng/mL), ii. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) &gt; 300 units per liter (U/L), iii.
             D-Dimers &gt; reference range, or iv. C-reactive protein (CRP) &gt; 40 milligram per liter
             (mg/L).

          -  Subject provides informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical evidence of any significant acute or chronic disease or pathophysiologic
             manifestations (eg, complications of COVID-19 standard medical treatments) that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, may place the subject at undue medical risk.

          -  The subject has had a known (documented) serious anaphylactic reaction to blood, any
             blood-derived or plasma product or a past history of any hypersensitivity reactions to
             commercial immunoglobulin.

          -  A medical condition in which the infusion of additional fluid is contraindicated.

          -  Shock that is unresponsive to fluid challenge and/or multiple vasopressors and
             accompanied by multiorgan failure considered by the Principal Investigator not able to
             be reversed.

          -  Subjects with known (documented) thrombotic complications to polyclonal IVIG therapy
             in the past.

          -  Subjects with current or prior myocardial infarction, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, or
             thromboembolic event (within the past 12 months) or who have a history of
             thromboembolic events of unknown etiology.

          -  Subjects with limitations of therapeutic effort.

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or of child-bearing potential with a positive test
             for pregnancy blood or urine human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)-based assay at
             Screening/Baseline.

          -  Subjects participating in another interventional clinical trial with investigational
             medical product or device.

          -  Known history of prothrombin gene mutation 20210, homozygous Factor V Leiden
             mutations, antithrombin III deficiency, protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency or
             antiphospholipid syndrome.

          -  Presence of malignancy (either new diagnosis of malignancy or known residual disease)
             within the past 12 months.

          -  Creatinine at Screening is ≥ 4 mg/dL (or subject is dependent on dialysis/renal
             replacement therapy).

          -  Known Immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency with anti-IgA serum antibodies.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension at the time of Screening (systolic blood pressure &gt; 200 mm
             Hg) or refractory severe hypotension with sustained systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mm Hg
             unresponsive to vasopressors.
