  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe COVID-19 patients at a high risk of venous thromboembolism. We studied patients in 2
      intensive care units of university hospitals in Barcelona and Badalona, Spain. We performed a
      cut-off screening of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) with bilateral duplex ultrasound to 230
      patients.

    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with coagulation disorders and increased risk of
      venous thromboembolism (VTE). The aim of the study is to determine the cumulative incidence
      of VTE in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and its impact on prognosis.

      Methods Cohort study of critically ill patients due to COVID-19. A bilateral venous
      compression (CUS) ultrasound screening of the lower extremities was performed during a
      cut-off period in 2 intensive care units of university hospitals in Spain. Asymptomatic and
      symptomatic VTE were registered: pulmonary embolism (PE) (diagnosed by CT-angiography) and
      deep venous thrombosis (DVT). The characteristics of the patients, results of their blood
      tests and their evolution after 7 days of follow-up were recorded.
