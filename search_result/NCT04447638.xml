  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has brought about a requirement of intensive care and
      mechanical ventilation for a significant portion of patients. Percutaneous tracheostomy is
      performed in order to reduce the complications that may develop due to prolonged endotracheal
      intubation.

      Different methods are needed for situations in which the potential for producing aerosols is
      high, such as intubation and tracheostomy. One of these methods is the aerosol box.To share
      our experiences of percutaneous tracheostomy performed with aerosol box in COVID-19 patients.
      Patients who underwent percutaneous tracheostomy between March 2020 and June 2020 in the
      pandemic intensive care unit were evaluated retrospectively.The study is designed as a
      clinical trial study. This study was performed in faculty of medicine hospital's intensive
      care unit which is located in Canakkale province Turkey.
