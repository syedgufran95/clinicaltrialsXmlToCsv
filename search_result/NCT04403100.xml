  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by high morbidity and mortality, especially in
      certain subgroups of patients. To date, no treatment has been shown to be effective in
      controlling this disease in hospitalized patients with moderate and / or severe cases of this
      disease. Hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir / ritonavir have been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV
      viral replication in experimental severe acute respiratory symptoms models and have similar
      activity against SARS-CoV2. Although widely used in studies of critically ill patients, to
      date, no study has demonstrated its role on the treatment of high-risk, newly diagnosed
      patients with COVID-19 and mild symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019 a series of viral pneumonia cases were reported in the city of Wuhan, China.
      A new subtype of coronavirus has been identified as the causative agent of this condition. On
      February 11, 43,103 cases had already been described and on this day the World Health
      Organization (WHO) named this disease as COVID-19. With. The disease had spread out to
      several countries on different continents and on March 11, WHO declared a state of worldwide
      pandemic. Today (April 25, 2020) there are 2,719,897 cases and 187,705 deaths documented,
      with a global case-fatality ratio of 6.9%.

      To date, no treatment has been identified as effective in combating this disease which has
      been identified as with high mortality, therefore there are no specific therapeutic options.
      So far, efforts have been focused on the treatment of patients hospitalized with dyspnea and,
      although several promising drugs are being evaluated, none has demonstrated effectiveness in
      reducing morbidity and mortality at this stage of the disease, suggesting that perhaps the
      best time to use medications either before the onset of severe symptoms of respiratory
      distress.

      Thus, we propose the use of two drugs which experimentally have shown activity against
      SARS-CoV2 and being used in severely ill patients with COVID-19. Our hypothesis is that
      perhaps using such drugs before onset of complications will allow better outcomes on this
      patient population.

The bottles will be sealed and identified as &quot;Research Product A, B and C&quot; and with different colored labels. They will be randomly allocated among the participants. The research subjects, medical assistance, administrative and health staff will not have access to the contents of the bottles. The Arm Lopinavir/ ritonavir plus hydroxychloroquine will receive two of such bottles.
At the end of the study, after the statistical analysis and DMSB meeting, it will then be requested from third party documentation on content of each bottle and then have arms identified.</masking_description>
