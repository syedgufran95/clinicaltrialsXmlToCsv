    <description>The 7-point ordinal scale is an assessment of the clinical status and is performed as the first assessment on each study day. The scale is as follows: 1) Death; 2) Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); 3) Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 4) Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 5) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen; 6) Not hospitalized, limitation on activities; 7) Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Age ≥ 18 years old.

          2. Able to understand and provide a signed informed consent that fulfills the relevant
             Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) guidelines.

          3. Has laboratory-confirmed positive novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) test, as determined
             by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or other commercial or public health assay in any
             specimen &lt; 72 hours prior to enrollment, or meets the criteria to guide the evaluation
             and testing of patients under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19
             (https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2020/HAN00428.asp).

          4. Has a confirmed NEW score of 0-5.

          5. Has at least one of the following high-risk factors associated with a higher risk of
             COVID-19 progression:

               1. Age ≥ 60 years.

               2. Hypertension currently managed by at least 1 antihypertensive medication.

               3. Type 1 or 2 diabetes.

               4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) diagnosed per medical history.

          6. Adequate respiratory and heart function, evidenced by the following laboratory
             results:

               1. Respiratory rate (RR) &lt; 20 breaths per minute (bpm).

               2. Heart rate (HR) &lt; 90 beats per minute (bpm).

               3. Arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) &gt; 93% on room air.

          7. Agrees to the collection of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and venous blood per protocol.

          8. Ability to participate in required study visits and participate in adequate follow-up,
             as required by this protocol.

          9. Agreement to practice effective contraception for female subjects of child-bearing
             potential and non-sterile males. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must agree
             to use effective contraception while on study and for at least 1 month after the last
             dose of N-803. Non-sterile male subjects must agree to use a condom while on study and
             for up to 1 month after the last dose of N-803. Effective contraception includes
             surgical sterilization (eg, vasectomy, tubal ligation), two forms of barrier methods
             (eg, condom, diaphragm) used with spermicide, intrauterine devices (IUDs), oral
             contraceptives, and abstinence.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Shortness of breath or hypoxia defined by a ratio of partial pressure of arterial
             oxygen to the percentage of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ≤ 300 mmHg or signs of serious
             lower airway disease.

          2. Signs or symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), systemic inflammatory
             response syndrome (SIRS)/shock, or cardiac failure; or need for supplemental oxygen.

          3. Inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], d-dimer,
             ferritin, and IL-6) &gt; 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN).

          4. Assessed by the Investigator to be unable or unwilling to comply with the requirements
             of the protocol.

          5. Pregnant and nursing women. A negative serum or urine pregnancy test during screening
             prior to the first dose must be documented before N-803 is administered to a female
             subject of child-bearing potential.
