  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Invivoscribe, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary LabPMM, LLC are collecting peripheral
      blood specimens from patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 viral infections. These donors will
      be from a population of patients who are already providing nasal pharyngeal (NP) swab samples
      in universal transport media (UTM) for COVID-19 testing at LabPMM LLC. Specimens meeting this
      research protocol's inclusion criteria may be evaluated with various molecular techniques in
      order to identify nucleic acid sequences, antibodies, and/or antigens with the potential of
      being used to develop novel SARS-CoV-2 detection methods and COVID- 19 treatments and/or
      prevention methods (e.g. drug or vaccine development).

      This research protocol describes the collection and analysis of peripheral blood samples to:

        -  Identify nucleic acid sequences that may be used aide in the development of SARSCoV- 2
           detection methods.

        -  Identify antibodies that may be used aide in the development of SARS-CoV-2 detection
           methods.

        -  Identify antigens that may be used aide in the development of SARS-CoV-2 detection
           methods. -Identify nucleic acid sequences that may be used aide in the development of
           COVID- 19 treatments and/or vaccines.

        -  Identify antibodies that may be used aide in the development of COVID-19 treatments
           and/or vaccines.

        -  Identify antigens that may be used aide in the development of COVID-19 treatments and/or
           vaccines.
