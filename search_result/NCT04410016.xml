      Project Aims:

        1. To describe the cost, reach and usage of the Staff Wellbeing Centres

        2. To gather insight into experiences of those who access the facility ('service users') as
           well as those of support workers ('wellbeing buddies').

        3. To identify any facilitators, obstacles or barriers to accessing the facility.

        4. To identify perceptions of facility users and non-users towards the value of the
           facilities during and after the coronavirus pandemic.

        5. To establish recommendations for longer-term sustainability of the wellbeing centres.

      Interviews will be conducted with up to 45 interview participants (10-15 Wellbeing Buddies,
      25-30 Staff).

      Online survey will be conducted - all Nottingham University Hospitals National Health Service
      (NHS) staff invited to take part (&gt;14,000).

      The survey will include measures of mental wellbeing (Warwick-Edinburgh Wellbeing Scale,
      14-item - license received), and single items measures of job stressfulness, job
      satisfaction, presenteeism, turnover intentions and work engagement.
