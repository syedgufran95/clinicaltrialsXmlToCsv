    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional survey which will be distributed online between surgeons. The
      survey was proposed by a consensus of consultants of surgery and revised by an improvement
      consultant. It consists of a semi-structured questionnaire that is provided in English
      language. The survey will be conducted online through an online survey development
      cloud-based software (SurveyMonkey®; San Mateo, CA, USA). Participants will be aware of the
      nature of the survey and informed that they will be listed as co-authors. Collected data will
      be confidential and anonymous.

      The first sector of the questionnaire includes trainee demographics and baseline
      characteristics. Then the questionnaire aims to compare the trainee experience before and
      after the pandemic with focus on research activities, clinical, and surgical practice.

      Statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS v. 20. Data distribution will be tested for
      normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the Shapiro-Wilk test. Categorical variables
      will be expressed as group percentages and will be compared for independent samples using the
      Chi-square test. Continuous data of the survey will be presented as medians with ranges or
      means and standard deviations. A comparison of continuous data will be compared for
      independent samples using the T-test or Mann-Whitney test according to the data distribution.
      Spearman correlation coefficient will be used for further assessment of the strength of the
      association between variables. The statistical significance level will be set at &lt;0.05.
