  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The actual COVID-19 epidemy is an unprecedented healthcare problem. Although acute
      respiratory distress syndrome is the main organ failure, acute kidney injury (AKI) has
      appeared to be more frequent and more severe than expected. Some data suggested a potential
      direct renal tropism of the virus, or undirect injury by &quot;cytokine storm&quot;.

      The aims of this study are:

        1. To describe incidence, severity and mortality associated with AKI during covid-19
           infection in ICU

        2. To identify specific risk factors for AKI

        3. To explore pathophysiologic mechanism of AKI during COVID-19 infection
