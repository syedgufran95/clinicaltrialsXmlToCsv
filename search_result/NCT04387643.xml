    <textblock>
      Preparing to deal with Covid-19 outbreak in Rajasthan, India, health care workers were given
      Ayurvedic Kadha (combination of ayurvedic herbal extracts) starting from the end of February
      2020. Then, majority of these health care workers were put on front line managing screening,
      monitoring, quarantine and treating Covid 19 patients. This real-life study aimed to
      determine the experience of health care workers who had Ayurveda kadha before starting as
      front-line workers.
