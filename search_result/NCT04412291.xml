    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a randomized, controlled, single-center open-label trial to compare
      standard-of-care (SOC) treatment with SOC + anakinra or SOC + tocilizumab treatment in
      hospitalized adult subjects who are diagnosed with severe COVID 19.

      Arm A: Standard-of-care Treatment (SOC) Arm B: Anakinra + SOC Arm C: Tocilizumab + SOC.

      All subjects will be treated with standard-of-care treatment and broad spectrum antibiotics
      initiated before or latest 24 hours after initiation of treatment with study drug.

      The primary follow up period of the study is 29 days
