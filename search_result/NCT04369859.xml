  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently spreading rapidly
      around the globe, causing a major public health issue. There is currently very few data about
      the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy, and potential in utero infection. This is a prospective
      observational study of COVID-19 diagnosed pregnant patients. This objective is to examine the
      impact of COVID-19 during pregnancy on the rates of obstetric and perinatal complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 can range from a benign upper respiratory tract infection
      to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), fatal in 1% of cases. However, pregnant
      women and their fetuses could particularly be vulnerable to the infection, as shown by
      previous human coronavirus outbreaks (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV).

      Cases will be recruited among all pregnant women aged &gt;18 years old who have tested positive
      for COVID-19 and are followed in a maternity belonging to the French South Regional
      Perinatology Network. Voluntary physicians will refer eligible participants to the
      study-coordinating center at APHM University Hospital. The participants will be followed by
      phone after having provided an informed consent. Clinical symptoms, laboratory and imaging
      findings, maternal and perinatal outcomes will be recorded.
