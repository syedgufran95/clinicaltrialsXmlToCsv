  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Covid 19, a novel coronavirus, causes infection that, while mild to moderate in many people,
      can lead to severe disease in a significant portion. Currently, it is expected that the
      majority, 81%, of patients with COVID-19 will have mild to moderate disease, with 14% having
      more severe disease (2). There exists a number of candidate drugs that may inhibit SARS-CoV-2
      infection or progression of disease. Simple, safe and low-cost strategies that may be the
      best solution to inhibit infection and limit transmission and spread of infection.

      Ivermectin is a drug initially synthesized and used as an anthelmintic. It has been found to
      have activity against several RNA viruses such as the SARS-CoV-2 by mechanisms that inhibit
      importin α/β-mediated nuclear transport that may prevent viral proteins from entering the
      nucleus to alter host cell function. A recent in vitro study showed that a single dose of
      ivermectin could kill COVID-19 in vitro within 48 hours. A recent multi-continent
      retrospective study of 1,400 patients demonstrated an association of ivermectin use with
      lower in-hospital mortality 1.4% versus 8.5%. Given these findings and its safety profile,
      cost and ease of administration, Ivermectin warrants study as a potential treatment to
      prevent progression of COVID 19 infection.
