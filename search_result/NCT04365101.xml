      This study is a Phase 1 / 2 trial to determine the safety and efficacy of CYNK-001, an
      immunotherapy containing Natural Killer (NK) cells derived from human placental CD34+ cells
      and culture-expanded, in patients with moderate COVID-19 disease.

          -  Patient has known active malignancy, unless the Patient has been free of disease for &gt;
             3 years from the date of signing the ICF. Exceptions include the following noninvasive
