      This study is a randomized, double-blinded, single-center, placebo-controlled phase 1&amp;2
      clinical trial in children and adolescents aged 3-17 years. The experimental vaccine and
      placebo were both manufactured by Sinovac Research &amp; Development Co., Ltd. A total of 552
      subjects will be enrolled, with 72 at phase 1, and 480 at phase 2. Subjects will be assigned
      to receive two doses of different dosage of experimental vaccine or placebo on the schedule
      of day 0,28.
