  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: In the Covid-19 pandemic context, all healthcare teams face clinical,
      organizational and technical challenges given the contagion, severity and mortality
      characteristics of the disease. A study reported the negative psychological impact on
      healthcare workers of this new situation, in terms of depression, anxiety and distress.
      Working in frontline constitutes an independent risk factor for worse mental health outcomes.

      Methods: This is a cross-sectional study aiming to compare levels of burnout, emotional
      distress and needs between frontline Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 healthcare workers. Any
      physician, nurse and physiotherapist will be recruited from emergency care units and Covid-19
      care units (target group) and from non-Covid-19 care units (control group) from different
      hospitals in Belgium. The participation will occur on a voluntary basis. Participants will be
      recruited from April 15th 2020 to May 15th 2020. Participants will complete self-reported
      questionnaires and scales. A mixed-mode data collection will be carried out, either in paper
      or web-based form. This mixed-mode survey will ensure the highest range of participants,
      considering the hygiene and organizational requirements for target care units. Assessment
      will provide socio-demographic characteristics and professional information. It will also
      measure professional fulfillment and burnout with the Stanford Professional Fulfillment Index
      (PFI), emotional distress with the Depression, Anxiety and Distress Scale-Short Form
      (DASS-21), sleep disturbance with the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and needs with the Needs
      and Difficulties Inventory (developed for the study).

      Hypothesis: This study is based on the hypothesis that higher levels of burnout, depression,
      anxiety and stress will be found in frontline Covid-19 healthcare workers than in
      non-Covid-19 healthcare workers. Considering the unprecedented challenges for healthcare
      workers and organizations, and considering the exploratory nature of the study, no hypothesis
      is made for the needs of the healthcare workers.

      Statistical Analysis: Means and standard deviation will be calculated for the PFI, the
      DASS-21, the ISI and the NDI. Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) will be performed
      including the PFI, the DASS-21 and the ISI scores to test the effect of group (work
      position), occupation and the two-way group × occupation interaction effect. Age, gender,
      profession, sector of activity, job status and job experience will be entered as covariate.
      Odds ratio will be also provided. All tests are two-tailed and alpha is set at .05. All
      analyzes will be performed using IBM SPSS®, version 26.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional comparative study based on self-reported questionnaires and scales
      (validated for the most part) assessing the levels of burnout, emotional distress, sleep
      disturbance and needs in frontline Covid-19 healthcare workers vs non-Covid-19 healthcare
      workers. The enrollment and the course of the study will be carried out on site. Participants
      are volunteers and are informed about the objectives and methods of the study.

      Any physician, nurse or physiotherapist (referred as &quot;healthcare worker&quot;) actively working in
      a medical care unit from different medical facilities will be informed of the study. An email
      containing information regarding the study and its implications will be sent. If required by
      the care unit they work in, potential participants will also be invited to a one-time
      information session. Potential participants will also be given an information form during
      this oral information session. Participants will be recruited from April 15th to May 15th
      2020.

      The assessment will be proposed by paper or web-based self-reported questionnaires and
      scales. This mixed-mode survey will not be randomized and will ensure the highest range of
      participants, considering the hygiene and organizational requirements in the target units.
      The assessment time will be proposed at the participant's inclusion. Because of the
      mixed-mode survey and anonymity of data, the completion of questionnaires and scales will be
      considered as informed consent as stated in the information form received by the
      participants.

      The questionnaires and scales include sociodemographic characteristics, professional
      information, the Professional Fulfillment Index (PFI), the Depression, Anxiety and Stress
      Scale-Short Form (DASS-21), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the Needs and Difficulties
      Inventory (NDI, developed for the study).

      Healthcare workers from emergency units, non-intensive Covid-19 and intensive Covid-19 units
      will be in the target group. Healthcare workers from non-Covid-19 units will be in the
      control group. In terms of enrollment, 200 participants (100 in each group) are expected. The
      objectives of the study will be reached by statistical comparison of these groups.

      In terms of data collection, the data manager collects data from paper version and electronic
      version. For the paper version, participants will be able to deposit their assessment in
      specific drop boxes available in the concerned care units. Then, data manager's assistant
      will be in charge of producing a digital copy. The data from the paper version will undergo
      double encoding (by two assistants, not linked to the principal investigator) in order to
      reduce encoding errors. The electronic data will be stored on a secure platform, linked to
      the Free University of Brussels. The paper version will be stored in a secure location within
      Erasme Hospital (Brussels, Belgium), accessible only by the principal investigator and the
      data manager. Evaluations, whether paper or electronic, will be destroyed 1 month after study
      completion date.

      Statistical analysis will consist firstly in a comparative analysis of participants'
      sociodemographic and professional characteristics using Chi-squared (or Student t test,
      Mann-Whitney U test when applicable for continuous variable) test for each categorical
      variable. Secondly, descriptive analyses will be performed on severity categories for
      professional fulfillment, burnout, insomnia, depression, anxiety and stress. Differences
      between groups regarding severity levels will be tested using X2. A two-way MANOVA will be
      used to test main effects of working position (group effect), occupation type (occupation
      effect) and to test a group × occupation interaction effect on fulfillment, burnout, insomnia
      and mental health scores. The two-way MANOVA will be adjusted for age, gender, marital
      status, workload and job status. Multivariable logistic regression analyses will be performed
      to estimate risk factors for burnout, clinically significant insomnia and severe to extremely
      severe depression, anxiety and stress. These will be presented as odds ratios, with 95%
      confidence intervals, adjusting for confounders. All tests will be two-tailed and alpha was
      set at .05. All analyses will be performed using IBM SPSS® v26.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Burnout</measure>
    <time_frame>1 assessment time, at inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with the Professional Fulfillment Index (PFI). This is a 16-item scale, divided into 2 sub-scales: professional fulfillment (6 items) and burnout, including professional exhaustion (4 items) and interpersonal disengagement (6 items). Subscales scores are given by the mean of all sub-scale items (professional fulfillment, 0-4; burnout, 0-4). Cut-off scores are set for the fulfillment sub-scale at &gt; 3, significant professional fulfillment and for the burnout sub-scale at &gt; 1.33, significant burnout.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Emotional Distress</measure>
    <time_frame>1 assessment time, at inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-Short Form (DASS-21). This a 21-item scale divided into 3 7-item sub-scales: depression, anxiety and stress. Sub-scales scores are given by the sum of all sub-scale items. The DASS has a 4-point Likert scale. Responses options range from &quot; Never &quot; to &quot; Almost always &quot; (0-3 score range). Only cut-off scores are provided for the original version of the DASS. Sub-scales scores must therefore be multiplied by 2. Cut-off scores for depression are Normal, 0-9; Mild, 10-13; Moderate, 14-20; Severe, 21-27; Extremely severe, 28+. Cut-off scores for anxiety are Normal, 0-7; Mild, 8-9; Moderate, 10-14; Severe, 15-19; Extremely severe, 20+. Cut-off scores for stress are Normal, 0-14; Mild, 15-18; Moderate, 19-25; Severe, 26-33; Extremely severe, 34+.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Insomnia</measure>
    <time_frame>1 assessment time, at inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). This is a 7-item scale. The ISI has a 5-point Likert scale (0-4 score range). Responses options range from &quot; None &quot; to &quot; Very severe &quot; for items 1a., 1b. and 1c., from &quot; Very satisfied &quot; to &quot; Very dissatisfied &quot; for item 2 and from &quot; None &quot; to &quot; Very much &quot; for items 3,4 and 5. The ISI provides a total score by summing all items scores. Cut-off scores are set for no clinically significant insomnia (0-7), subthreshold insomnia (8-14), moderate clinical insomnia (15-21) and severe clinical insomnia (22-28).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Needs and difficulties in work situations</measure>
    <time_frame>1 assessment time, at inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with the Needs and Difficulties Inventory (developed for the study). This scale has been set up for this study. This is a 17-item scale, divided into 5 sub-scales: information/communication (3 items), practical (4 items), physical (4 items), emotional (4 items) and ethical (2 items). The NDI has a 4-point Likert scale. Responses options range from &quot; Not at all agree &quot; to &quot; Totally agree &quot; (0-3 score range). The NDI provides 5 sub-scales scores by summing all sub-scales items: information/communication, 0-9; practical, 0-12; physical, 0-12; emotional, 0-12 and ethical, 0-6. As a no-validated scale, scores and their treatment will be taken into account with caution. In order to compare sub-scales with each other, each sub-scale score must be divided by its maximum value, providing a coefficient (0-1).</description>
