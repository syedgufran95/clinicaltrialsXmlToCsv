  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of molnupiravir (MK-4482)
      compared to placebo. The primary hypothesis is that molnupiravir is superior to placebo as
      assessed by the percentage of participants who are hospitalized and/or die through Day 29

             respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection with sample collection ≤7
             days prior to randomization. PCR is the preferred method; however other diagnostic
             methods are allowed if authorized by use in the country.

          -  Has initial onset of signs/symptoms attributable to COVID-19 for ≤7 days prior to
             randomization and at least 1 sign/symptom attributable to COVID-19 on the day of
             randomization

          -  Has mild or moderate COVID-19. Participants with mild COVID-19 must have at least 1
             characteristic or underlying medical condition associated with an increased risk of
             severe illness from COVID-19

          -  Has oxygenation saturation of &gt;93% (on room air OR on supplemental oxygen prior to
             randomization which has not increased since onset of COVID-19 signs/symptoms) obtained
             at rest by study staff at randomization.

             method OR a user dependent method in combination with barrier method), or be abstinent
             from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a
             long-term and persistent basis) during the intervention period and for at least 7
             months after the last dose of study intervention; a WOCBP must have a negative highly
             sensitive pregnancy test (urine or serum test is required) within 24 hours before the

             COVID-19 therapeutics

          -  Has a baseline heart rate of &lt; 50 beats per minute at rest

          -  Has a platelet count &lt;100,000/μL or received a platelet transfusion in the 5 days
             prior to randomization.

             confound the protocol-specified assessments including but not limited to: participants
             who are not expected to survive longer than 48 hours after randomization, participants
             who are expected to require mechanical ventilation within 48 hours after
             randomization, or participants with a recent history of mechanical ventilation not
             associated with COVID-19, or participants with conditions that could limit
             gastrointestinal absorption of capsule contents.
