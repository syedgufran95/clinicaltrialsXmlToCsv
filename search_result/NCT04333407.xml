  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and associated COVID-19 disease in late
      December 2019 has led to a global pandemic. At the time of writing, there have been 150 000
      confirmed cases and 3500 deaths. Apart from the morbidity and mortality directly related to
      COVID-19 cases, society has had to also cope with complex political and economic
      repercussions of this disease.

      At present, and despite pressing need for therapeutic intervention, management of patients
      with COVID-19 is entirely supportive. Despite the majority of patients experiencing a mild
      respiratory illness a subgroup, and in particular those with pre-existing cardiovascular
      disease, will experience severe illness that requires invasive cardiorespiratory support in
      the intensive care unit.

      Furthermore, the severity of COVID-19 disease (as well as the likelihood of progressing to
      severe disease) appears to be in part driven by direct injury to the cardiovascular system.
      Analysis of data from two recent studies confirms a significantly higher likelihood of acute
      cardiac injury in patients who have to be admitted to intensive care for the management of
      COVID-19 disease.

      The exact type of acute of cardiac injury that COVID-19 patients suffer remains unclear.
      There is however mounting evidence that heart attack like events are responsible. Tests
      ordinarily performed to definitely assess for heart attacks will not be possible in very sick
      COVID-19 patients. Randomising patients to cardioprotective medicines will help us understand
      the role of the cardiovascular system in COVID-19 disease. It will also help us determine if
      there is more we can do to treat these patients.
