    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, single or multi-center, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study
      to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Rayaldee (CTAP101 Capsules) to treat adult subjects
      with mild to moderate COVID-19 who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 via nasopharynx swab and
      subsequent reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

    <measure>Severity and duration of disease as evidenced by COVID-19 symptoms using the FLU-PRO© questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>42 days</time_frame>
    <description>The FLU- PRO© questionnaire was specifically designed and validated to evaluate in clinical trials the presence, severity and duration of symptoms associated with viral infections. It contains 32 items (eg, felt hot, sweating, headache), grouped into 6 domains, that provide a comprehensive evaluation of such symptoms, using 5-point scales (values ranging from 0 to 4) with higher scores indicating worse symptoms.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female ≥18 years of age

          2. Confirmed within the past 3 days to have SARS-CoV-2 infection as evidenced by a
             positive nasopharyngeal swab test using RT-PCR

          3. Confirmed to have only mild or moderate COVID-19 based on a FLU-PRO© score of ≥ 1.5
             for each of the chest/respiratory and body/systemic domains, and the absence of
             clinical signs indicative of more severe disease (eg, oxygen saturation &lt; 94% on room
             air or respiration rate &gt; 30 bpm)

          4. Represents on self-assessment that the current COVID-19 symptoms are not consistent
             with usual health and that they are the same or worse than on the previous day

          5. Willing to limit the use of vitamin D therapies or supplements except for normally

          7. Must be without any disease state or physical condition that might impair evaluation

             participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical signs indicative of severe or critical COVID-19 disease (eg, oxygen

             three months

         14. Serum calcium ≥9.8 mg/dL in the last three months

         15. Evidence of existing or impending dehydration
