      like anxiety, depression, sleep disorders and symptoms of acute stress However psychological
      impact of quarantine is on none in chronic painful inflammatory rheumatism in France. The
      prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis is 0.5% of the population with frequent comorbidity such
      as anxiety and depression.
