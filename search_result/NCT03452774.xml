      International registry for cancer patients evaluating the feasibility and clinical utility of
      an Artificial Intelligence-based precision oncology clinical trial matching tool, powered by
      a virtual tumor boards (VTB) program, and its clinical impact on pts with advanced cancer to
      facilitate clinical trial enrollment (CTE), as well as the financial impact, and potential
      outcomes of the intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SYNERGY Registry is an international prospective, observational cohort study of eligible
      adult and pediatric pts with advanced solid and hematological malignancies, for whom the
      decision to consider CTE has already been made by their primary providers (PP). Using a
      proprietary application programming interface (API) linked to existing electronic health
      records (EHR) platforms, individual clinical data is extracted, analyzed and matched to a
      parametric database of existing institutional and non-institutional CT. Machine learning
      algorithms allow for dynamic matching based on CT allocation and availability for optimized
      matching. Patients voluntarily enroll into the registry, which is non-interventional with no
      protocol-mandated tests/procedures - all treatment decisions are made at the discretion of PP
      in consultation with their pts, based on the AI CT matching report, and VTB support. CTE will
      be assessed on variables including biomarkers, barriers to enrollment. Study duration
      anticipated as ~36 mo (~24-mo enrollment followed by 12 mo of data collection, to occur every
      3 mo). The primary analysis will be performed 12 mo after last pt enrolled. The impact time
      to initiation of CTE on PFS and OS will be estimated by Kaplan-Meier and Cox multivariable
      survival analysis. Enrollment is ongoing, with a target of â‰¥1500 patients.
