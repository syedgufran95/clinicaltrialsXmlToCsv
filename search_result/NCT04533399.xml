  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) vaccine called SARS-CoV-2 rS with Matrix-M1 adjuvant in approximately 2,664
      healthy HIV-negative (HIV-) adult participants and in approximately 240 medically stable
      HIV-positive (HIV+) adult participants in up to 10 sites across South Africa. A vaccine
      causes the body to have an immune response that may help prevent the infection or reduce the
      severity of symptoms. An adjuvant is something that can make a vaccine work better. This
      study will look at the protective effect, body's immune response, and safety of SARS-CoV-2 rS
      with Matrix-M1 adjuvant in these study populations. Participants in the study will randomly
      be assigned to receive SARS-CoV-2 rS with Matrix-M1 adjuvant or placebo. Each participant in
      the study will receive a total of 2 intramuscular injections over the course of the study.
