  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to verify if patients admitted to hospital in a medical division and
      in the intensive care unit for a COVID-19 infection are at higher risk of developing a VTE
      complication and if they actually present an increased hypercoagulable state.

    <textblock>
      Between December 2019 and January 2020, a new type of coronavirus, named as &quot;coronavirus
      disease 2019 - COVID-19&quot; by the World Health Organization, has widely spread throughout the
      world, becoming a global health threat. The new COVID-19 is similar to other two types of
      coronavirus that in the past two decades have emerged as cause of severe human disease:
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV
      (MERS-CoV). Severe respiratory disease or respiratory failure are the principal symptoms of
      critical patients, needing a management in ICU with mechanical ventilation.18 Data coming
      from laboratory results show a leucopenia mainly represented by a lymphopenia, that is a
      cardinal feature of COVID-19. Moreover, the concentration of several serum pro-thrombotic
      cytokines, such as interleukins (mainly IL-6, increased in 52% of patients), TNF-Î±, D-Dimer
      are reported to be significantly higher in COVID-19 patients, and significantly higher in
      ICU-patients than in non-ICU patients, suggesting an increased hypercoagulable state that,
      joined to the other main risk factors (immobilization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation,
      infective disease), place these patients to a potential greater risk of developing VTE
      complications.
