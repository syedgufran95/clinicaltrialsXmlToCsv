  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single-center registry with an embedded open-label single-arm clinical
      trial to determine the effects of standard of care treatment vs. standard of care plus AT-001
      on cardiac structure and function and in-hospital survival in patients hospitalized for
      management of COVID-19 infection. Eligible subjects with COVID-19 infection will be
      identified at the time of hospital admission based on existing infection control surveillance
      protocols, and will have clinical data extracted from the electronic medical record to
      determine clinical characteristics associated with cardiac structure and function and
      in-hospital survival. A subset of patients with history of diabetes mellitus and/or acute
      hyperglycemia (any glucose measurement &gt;126 mg/dl) and evidence of acute or chronic heart
      disease will be treated in an open-label fashion to receive an investigational aldose
      reductase inhibitor, AT-001 plus standard of care.

      The objectives of this study are:

        -  To characterize serial measures cardiac structure and function and in-hospital survival
           in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection

        -  To develop predictive models of cardiac risk in hospitalized COVID-19 infection patients

        -  To assess safety of treatment with AT-001 plus standard of care on in-hospital survival
           in patients with COVID-19

        -  To characterize the effects of treatment with AT-001 plus standard of care on
           in-hospital mortality, progression of acute lung injury requiring mechanical
           ventilation, and serial measures of cardiac structure and function
