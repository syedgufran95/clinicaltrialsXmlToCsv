  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate the efficacy of extracorporeal CO2 removal for correction of
      hypercapnia in coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)-associated acute respiratory distress
      syndrome
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19 is
      approximately 8%. Lung-protective ventilation is the current standard of care for ARDS. It
      limits lung and distal organ impairment, but is associated with hypercapnia in approximately
      14% of patients with mild to moderate ARDS and almost all patients with severe ARDS. In this
      setting, early implementing of an extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCO2R) therapy may prevent
      further escalation of invasiveness of therapy (eg, need for extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation (ECMO)). A number of low-flow ECCO2R devices are now available and some of those
      can be integrated into a renal replacement therapy (RRT) platform. This study aims to
      investigate the efficacy of an original ECCO2R system used in conjunction with a RRT platform
      in hypercapnic patients with COVID-19-associated mild-to-moderate ARDS with or without acute
      kidney injury (AKI) necessitating RRT.
