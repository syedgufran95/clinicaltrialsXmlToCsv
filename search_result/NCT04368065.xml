      This is an observational, direct-to-participant, web-based, longitudinal study of adults with
      potential exposure to COVID-19 to better understand risk factors, symptoms, and treatments
      for COVID-19 illness.

      This is an observational, direct-to-participant, web-based, longitudinal study of adults with
      potential exposure to COVID-19 to better understand risk factors, symptoms, and treatments
      for COVID-19 illness. Upon consent and enrollment, participants will complete an initial
      baseline survey reporting their demographics, relevant medical history, symptoms, use of
      prescription and non-prescription medications (prophylactic and curative) as well as use of
      supplements (e.g., vitamins, minerals, herbals) and other factors, such as extent of
      isolation. Participants are then followed for 3 months. During Month 1, participants will
      complete a symptom diary to record symptom progression and severity and provide updates on
      pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions twice a week. During Months 2 and 3,
      follow-up is reduced to twice a month to reduce patient burden and capture longer-term
      disease progression and treatment.

        Participants will be recruited through postings from partner organizations such as
        governments and professional associations as well as support from advertising, social
        media, and public relations. People with suspected exposure to COVID-19 will be asked to
        visit a portal landing page. The outreach will be targeted to participants in regions with
        high known prevalence of COVID-19 infections, though registration will be open to all.

    <ipd_description>It is anticipated that external researchers may want to leverage these data for public health and life sciences research. The intent is to provide limited data access to qualified researchers for research that has gone through a review process. Per legal requirements, the individual data from this registry may not be transported outside of the IQVIA secured server environment. However, researchers may submit requests to the IQVIA CARE Data Governance Committee (DGC) requesting approval and access for specific research purposes.</ipd_description>
