  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 lockdown presents particular challenges for people living with obesity. Indeed
      during this period, the lifestyle was deeply modified: diet, activity, and sleep behaviours,
      home office, take care of child, social distancing... All of these modifications may have led
      to stress and anxiety. It has been previously demonstrated that high perceived stress levels
      are correlated with high preference for sweet and fat foods . In this context caution would
      be exercised in obese patients especially those with binge eating disorders. Indeed binge
      eating disorder is characterized by compulsive overeating or consuming abnormal amounts of
      food while feeling unable to stop and a loss of control. And one key trigger of binge eating
      disorder is stress and anxiety. Thus, patients with binge eating disorders may have been more
      sensitive to the impact of lockdown and thus urgently would require appropriated care
      management.

      The main objective is to compare the eating behaviour between obese patients with or without
      binge eating disorders. The second objective is to compare the weight evolution between the
      two groups before and after the lockdown.

      To reach these objectives, the scientific team of the CIO project proposes to contact by
      phone and e-mail obese patients (with or without binge eating disorders) who have been
      hospitalized for their obesity disease before the start of the lockdown in the Endocrinology
      department of the Lyon Hospital. The patients will be asked to fill in several questionnaires
      (using an online tool) allowing to evaluate their mood, anxiety, eating behaviour, binge
      eating disorders… during the lockdown. The results of these questionnaires will be compared
      to those collected during their hospitalisation before the lockdown.

      The hypothesis is that participants suffering from binge eating disorder will have more sever
      eating behaviour perturbations as higher level of stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms.

    <description>The two groups (23 patients per group) will be contacted by phone or e-mail to participate to the CIO study. Once their agreement received, each patient will be asked to complete the same set of online questionnaires : weight, HAD (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale), BES (Binge Eating Scale), YFAS (Yale Food Addiction Scale), DEBQ (Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire), IPAQ (International physical activity questionnaire), COVID 19 questionnaire Penn State, items from the Do-It questionnaire, general questions on the lifestyle during the lockdown (custom questionnaire), COVID stress evaluation (custom questionnaire)</description>
