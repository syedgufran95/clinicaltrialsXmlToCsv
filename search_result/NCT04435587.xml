  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label randomised controlled study of oral ivermectin (600 mcg/kg/d* 3 day)
      versus combined of hydroxychloroquine plus darunavir/ ritonavir for 5 days treatment among
      asymptomatic carrier of SAR-CoV2 adult Thai population. Outcomes include safety and duration
      of detectable of SAR-CoV2 in nasopharyngeal/ throat (NP) swab by polymerase chain reaction
      amplification (PCR) after treatment. 40-50 patients in each treatment arm is planned, with an
      interim analysis when approximately 50% of cases is enrolled.

      -  Study procedure will be carried out after informed consent is obtained.

        -  Baseline physical exam and laboratory investigations will be performed.

        -  Eligible patients will be randomized to one of the two treatment arms.

        -  Symptoms and signs will be monitored daily.

        -  NP swab will be done at day5-7, and approximately weekly until discharge.

        -  Weekly complete blood counts, blood chemistries, electrocardiography will be performed
           for adverse event monitoring.

        -  Patients will be discharged at 2- 4 weeks after hospitalization, according to PCR
           results.

        -  There will be 1-2 follow up visit at out patient clinic for NP swab (patients with +ve
           last NP swab before discharge), and blood tests.

        -  Additional 5-8 ml. of EDTA blood will be taken at baseline and weekly for antibody
           detection.

        -  Interim analysis of both safety and efficacy will be performed when approximately 50% of
           enrollment is achieved.

        -  Intention to treat analysis is planned at the completion of enrollment.
