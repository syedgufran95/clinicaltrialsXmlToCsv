    <textblock>
      18 month study, funded by ESRC COVID-19 research fund. The aim is to explore and support the
      rapid shift from face-to-face to remote (telephone and video) conversations in primary care.
      There are three components: a study of clinical interactions and decision making (micro);
      four locality-based organisational case studies of new models of care (meso); abd a a study
      of how digital innovation can support NHS infrastructure and vice versa (macro).

      18 month study, funded by ESRC COVID-19 research fund. The aim is to explore and support the
      rapid shift from face-to-face to remote (telephone and video) conversations in primary care.
      There are three components: a study of clinical interactions and decision making (micro);
      four locality-based organisational case studies of new models of care (meso); abd a a study
      of how digital innovation can support NHS infrastructure and vice versa (macro). The methods
      are mainly qualitative (interviews, virtual ethnography, analysis of documents,
      micro-analysis of conversations) and are designed to inform action research.

      Key deliverables:

      At least two evidence-based assessment tools: qualitative (questions for remote assessment of
      breathlessness) and quantitative (a COVID-19-specific early warning score)

      Transferable lessons about how to achieve rapid spread and scale-up, spread in real time
      through our extensive intersectoral networks

      Strengthened infrastructure for supporting digital innovation in the NHS
