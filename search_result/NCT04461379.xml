  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Mexico the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is 232, 000 and 28,510 deaths.
      Health workers are at high risk of COVID-19 infection. Their absence from work dramatically
      limits the ability to contain the disease. There is currently no vaccine to prevent the
      disease. Since the introduction to the vaccination schedule of the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin
      (BCG) live attenuated vaccine directed towards tuberculosis prevention, a decrease in infant
      mortality has been reported, not related only to tuberculosis. BCG vaccine has been
      hypothesized to have a non-specific role towards other unrelated pathogens such as viruses
      that cause airway disease, with reduced morbidity and mortality. In murine as well as in
      human models it has been shown to decrease the incidence of acute respiratory influenza
      infections. Likewise, in countries with a high endemicity for tuberculosis, the BCG vaccine
      reduces the incidence of respiratory infections by up to 80% . In healthy subjects, the BCG
      vaccine increases the production of proinflammatory cytokines in monocytes. Likewise, it
      increases the epigenetic response, causing an increase in the transcription of genes
      important in the antimicrobial response, as well as an improvement in cellular function. This
      is the first national clinical trial to evaluate prospectively the effect that the BCG
      vaccine offers towards the prevention and reduction of severity in cases of COVID-19.

      The study design is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

      Age stratified randomization (&lt;45 years and&gt; 45 years) was performed using permuted blocks
      with allocation concealment.

      The sample size is 908 patients. 454 patients in each stratum (227 with placebo and 227 with
      BCG vaccine).

      Eligible participants will be healthcare professionals over 18 years of age who are in
      contact with patients with COVID-19, with negative IgG and IgM antibodies results for
      SARS-CoV-2 prior to their inclusion and sign the informed consent. After signing the informed
      consent, the participants will be randomized 1:1 to the intervention group (BCG vaccine) or
      control (placebo), a medical history will be performed, and a blood plasma sample will be
      obtained to determine specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

      The patients will be followed up for 6 months after the application of the vaccine, they will
      be contacted by phone every two weeks in order to identify the adverse effects of the vaccine
      (30 days after the application) as well as to identify symptoms of COVID-19, in addition,
      follow-up visits will be carried out at the third and sixth months, in each of these visits a
      blood plasma sample will be obtained and IgG and IgM antibodies will be measured.

      Statistical Analysis Type: By intention to treatment
