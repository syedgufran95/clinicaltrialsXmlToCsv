  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this project is to develop an emergent treatment protocol using
      adoptive T-cell therapy for the treatment of severe COVID-19. The central hypothesis is that
      SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells from convalescent donors who have recovered from COVID-19 can be
      manufactured expeditiously for the treatment of severe SARS-CoV-2 infections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of
      Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, no vaccine or specific treatment has been
      proven to be effective. While waiting for vaccine to be developed, passive immunity can be
      acquired immediately by adoptive transfer of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells from convalescent
      donors into newly infected patients.

      The aim of this protocol is to demonstrate the feasibility of preparing SARS-CoV-2 specific T
      cells from convalescent donors for urgent clinical use. The specific hypothesis is that
      SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells can be isolated from the blood of convalescent donors rapidly and
      efficiently using SARS-CoV-2 specific peptides and an automated medical device for emergent
      treatment of severe COVID-19 disease.

      A minimum of 8 convalescent donors will be recruited from Singapore to attain HLA sharing
      with at least 90% of the general population.
