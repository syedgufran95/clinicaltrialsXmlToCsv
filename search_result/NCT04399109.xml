  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site, prospective, non-randomised trial assessing the implementation of a
      smartphone application-based model of care for patients with COVID-19 infection managed in
      community isolation. We will recruit 2000 COVID +ve patients aged 18 years and over who are
      managed at home. The objective will be to describe the rates of avoidable presentations to ED
      and 30 day all case mortality per diagnosed COVID-19 case and to compare these to a
      propensity matched and synthetic control group.

    <description>TCC-COVID is an app-based model of care which includes a smartphone app and a pulse oximeter that measures oxygen saturation, pulse rate and collects symptoms, connected to a back-end clinical database with inbuilt data analytics.</description>

    <description>Propensity matched and synthetic control groups will be utilised from another local health district not participating in the ReCOVER study. The control group will not be actively recruited at the same time as the intervention. The control group will be matched via data linkage at the completion of the trial. However, it is not a historical control, as the control standard of care treatment will be provided simultaneously as our intervention</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Device</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>TCC-COVID mHealth solution</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients place their index finger in the pulse oximeter to measure their oxygen saturation and pulse rate twice a day, which will take approximately 5 minutes each time. Patients then enter the results into the TCC-COVID app twice daily, and complete a symptom questionnaire via the TCC-COVID app once daily, which will take approximately 5 minutes. The symptom questionnaire was designed specifically for this study. The measurements and information are directly connected to a clinician interface (KIOLA database) which provides the data of all patients in aggregate and an easy to use responsive format with customisable alerts. The alerts identify if the oxygen saturation levels are low or the pulse rate is out of range. The alerts also identify if a measurement has not been completed in a timely manner and the central monitoring service will contact the patient to check on their safety or if they are experiencing any technical issues. The overall duration of participation will be 14 days.</description>
