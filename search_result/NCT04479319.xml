  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered Coronavirus which was first
      identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Then the novel coronavirus outbreak was
      described and announced as a pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020.

      Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is currently the gold standard test
      for diagnosis of COVID-19. Nevertheless, due to its high false-negative rates (%10-50),
      diagnosis and treatment decisions do not depend on RT-PCR alone. Clinical presentation of
      patient and radiological findings are also important. However, neither clinical presentation
      nor computed tomography (CT) findings are specific for COVID-19. As a consequence of these
      challenges, the diagnosis of the disease and the protection of the community health become
      more difficult. The investigators of this study hypothesized that deep learning-based
      decision support system may help for definitive diagnosis of COVID-19. The aim is to develop
      a deep learning-based decision support system algorithm based on clinical presentation of
      patient, laboratory and CT findings and RT-PCR data. Previously, deep learning algorithms
      with the use of widely known deep neural network architectures such as Inception, UNet,
      ResNet were developed. However all of these studies were based on CT findings. There are not
      any deep learning study in literature combining the clinical, radiological, and laboratory
      findings of patients.

      The project is based on the available data of COVID-19 patients that will be obtained from
      the Ministry of Health. Then the data will be evaluated for relevance and reliability and
      labeled for the training of machine. Following the anonymization of data, data will be
      processed according to the predetermined inclusion-exclusion criteria. Thorax CT data will be
      labeled as typical / indeterminate / atypical / negative for COVID-19 pneumonia. Also, CT
      images of patients with known non-COVID-19 diseases will be labeled for the training of
      machine. Then, fever, lymphocyte count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, contact information,
      RT-PCR findings will be labeled. Subsequently, the patients will be labeled and the machine
      will be trained with deep learning method with the help of this grouped and labeled data.
      Following the training phase, the algorithm will be tested and if the machine reaches the
      target specificity and sensitivity, the prototype will be tested. And then, the prototype
      will be embedded into the hospital software system. This software and algorithm will serve as
      an early warning system for clinicians and provide a better diagnostic rate especially with
      decreasing false-negative results. The effects of a pandemic cannot be measured by only the
      number of people diagnosed and isolated, or treatment provided. A pandemic affects not only
      community health but also individuals' psychological status, education, teaching methods,
      working models, daily lifestyles, producer/consumer behaviors, supply/demand balance; in
      other words every single area of life. On top of that, a pandemic causes long-term damages
      hard to reverse. The software will increase the diagnostic success rates, help to control the
      pandemic and minimize the collateral damages mentioned above. The investigators believe that,
      the product that will be produced at the end of this project will be of great benefit in
      controlling the secondary wave of COVID-19 expected to occur.
