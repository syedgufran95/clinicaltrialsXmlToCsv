  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A crisis situation leads to changes in life. During December 2019, many people contracted
      pneumonia in the Chinese city of Wuhan. On January 7, 2020, the novel coronavirus (Covid-19)
      was identified as the cause of this disease. Within five months, the virus spread around the
      globe and forced countries to restrict public life. Due to the high infection rates in
      Europe, a lockdown followed between March and April 2020 (except in Sweden). As the number of
      infections decreased, European countries began to gradually relax the lockdown from May 2020.

      The lockdown and the later stages of loosening have an impact on lifestyle. Institutions of
      higher education must also adapt to this situation and have switched to distance learning.

      The University of Applied Sciences of Bern (BFH), Department of Health Professions with the
      Departments (DHP) of Nutrition and Dietetics and Physiotherapy, considers the question of the
      degree to which nutritional and exercise behavior has changed.

      The findings provide recommendations for future crises for students and employees of the
      BFH-DHP.

      In order to achieve this, at the BFH-DHP two anonymous online surveys will be conducted.

      There is little evidence of how physical activity and eating behavior changes during a
      pandemic period and in the period after a pandemic period of students and employees at the
      BFH-DHP. This observational study will assists to determine the impact of an immediate change
      within a pandemic on physical activity, nutrition, sleep and alcohol consumption and the
      consequences after a period of one year.
