  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 emerging disease due to a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), started in Wuhan,
      China, last December, 2019. In the past three months, the virus has spread rapidly worldwide
      to reach the pandemic threshold.

      Research has since been carried out and is intensifying in order to describe the clinical
      characteristics of infected patients, to identify the prognostic factors of acute respiratory
      distress syndrome [ARDS] and the death; and to assess the effectiveness of new antivirals and
      therapeutic strategies to treat COVID-19.

      Treatments currently being investigated include:

        -  Potentially effective treatments: (hydroxy)chloroquine, Remdesivir, Lopinavir, Ritonavir
           +/- IFN-ß-1a (currently evaluated in the European discovery trial), methylprednisolone
           in patients with ARDS;

        -  Potentially harmful treatments: antihypertensives such as converting enzyme inhibitors
           and angiotensin receptor antagonists.

      We made the hypothesis that (1) patients receiving ARBs or ACEi's have a higher risk to
      present a serious COVID-19 infection disease and (2) patients receiving synthetic AMD (e.g.
      HCQ and CQ) have a lower risk to present a serious covid19 infection disease.

      Using data from the French insurance health database (SNDS) and hospital discharge database
      (PMSI), our objectives are

        -  Main objective: To assess the risk of moderate to serious COVID-19 infections in
           patients using synthetic anti-malarial drugs (AMD) or anti-hypertensive drugs
           (Angiotensin receptor-blocking/Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors).

        -  Secondary objective : To examine the risk of moderate to serious COVID-19 infections
           according of age, sex, co-morbidities, level of exposure of AMD, geographical locations
           and underlying comorbidities.

      This in order to:

        -  To prevent moderate to serious COVID-19 infections in at-risk population (diabetes,
           elderly, respiratory failure population) using synthetic AMD.

        -  To prevent moderate to serious COVID-19 infections in at-risk population stopping
           angiotensin receptor-blocking and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors.

        -  13 million patients treated by ARBs or ACEi's from the French national health insurance

    <description>Prevalent users will be those with at least one dispensing of AMD or ARBs/ACEi's from 01/01/2019 to 01/01/2020. Exposed users will be those among prevalent users who still received AMD or ARBs/ACEi's on 31/12/2019. The inclusion period will be from 01/01/2019 to 01/01/2020. The study end date will be 30/06/2020. For each treatment AMD or ARB/ACRi's, the persistence of treatment will be defined as the length of time from initiation to discontinuation. Initiation will be the date of the first reimbursement of AMD or ARB/ACRi's during the inclusion period. We will define the discontinuation of treatment as a period of more than 90 days without fulfilment of a prescription for the same treatment after the period covered by the previous prescription i.e 30 days. Exposure to a combination of drugs will be defined as a period shorter than 30 days between the prescription of two different systemic drugs and the fulfilment of another prescription for both drugs in the following 90 days.</description>
