    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics of
      SCTA01(anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody) in Healthy Chinese Subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, First-in-Human, Randomized, Double-blinded, Placebo-Controlled, Single
      Ascending Dose Study of SCTA01(Anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody) in Healthy Chinese
      Subjects.

      Dose escalation will be guided by a safety review of clinical signs and symptoms, adverse
      events (AEs), and laboratory results of the prior dose cohort.

      An Interim analysis will be performed after Day 28 post-dose for the last dose cohort for
      review.
