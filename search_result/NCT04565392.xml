  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with early symptoms of COVID19 take 1 or 2 20-mg [milligram] tabs/day of famotidine
      with 2000 IU vitamin D3 and 2 grams [2000 mg] vitamin C for 14 days. Consent, baseline, and
      follow-up after treatment are handled via internet. A 14-day extension of the higher dose
      plus the vitamins is allowed. Results on 216 subjects gives 80% power at p=0.05 if 22% get
      hospitalized with low-dose vs 7% with &quot;high&quot;-dose famotidine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If taking Over-The-Counter (OTC) agents could prevent worsening and hospitalization for
      COVID19, it could stop the devastation wrought by the pandemic. A few OTC agents have
      pre-clinical and clinical rationale for utility: vitamins C and D, and especially famotidine.
      For this study, subjects get assigned to open-label treatment by birth day of the month; if
      odd, 1 tab famotidine/d; if even, 1 tab famotidine twice daily. All also take 2000 IU
      (International Units) vitamin D3 daily and 1 gram (1000 mg) vitamin C twice a day, with
      meals. Internet-driven study requires subjects to maintain contact and follow advice of local
      MD so it does not increase their risk with the disease. Baseline eligibility checklist
      follows informed consent. Subjects must have at least 4 of the standard symptoms of COVID19,
      be willing to buy their own supply of the 3 OTC agents specified in brand and dose by
      protocol, start them within the first 4 days of symptoms, and have a study partner to
      complete their follow-up in case they become unable (get hospitalized etc). They report their
      results after 14 days of use. The rate of subjects worsening or getting hospitalized is the
      main outcome measure. Subjects who don't get better, worsen, or get well and then worsen
      again can start taking 2 tablets a day of famotidine and the vitamins for another 14 days in
      an extension phase.
