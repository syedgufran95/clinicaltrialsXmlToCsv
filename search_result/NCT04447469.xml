  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interventional, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study encompassing 2 development
      phases (Phase 2 and Phase 3).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Phase 2 portion of the study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2 dose levels of
      mavrilimumab relative to placebo (standard of care) in participants who have tested positive
      for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and have x-ray/computerized
      tomography (CT) evidence of bilateral pneumonia, active or recent fever, and clinical
      laboratory results indicative of hyper-inflammation. The Phase 3 portion is intended to
      confirm Phase 2 efficacy and safety findings. In both Phase 2 and Phase 3, participants will
      be enrolled into 2 cohorts: Cohort 1 will include non-intubated, hospitalized participants
      who require supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≥ 92% (ie,
      &quot;non-ventilated&quot; participants); Cohort 2 will include hospitalized participants for whom
      mechanical ventilation was recently initiated (ie, &quot;ventilated&quot; participants). Following
      Screening, enrolled participants in each cohort will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive one of 2
      mavrilimumab dose levels, or placebo as a single intravenous (IV) infusion (Day 1).
      Participants will undergo primary study assessments through Day 29 and will be followed for
      safety through Day 90.
