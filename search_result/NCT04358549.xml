    <textblock>
      This is an open label, randomized, controlled, multicenter Phase 2 proof-of-concept study of
      favipiravir in hospitalized subjects with COVID-19. Subjects will be randomized within their
      study site and stratified by the severity of their disease to receive either favipiravir +
      standard of care (SOC) or SOC alone.

      The dose regimen will be 1800 mg favipiravir BID plus SOC or SOC alone on Day 1 followed by
      1000 mg BID favipiravir (800 mg BID for subjects with Child-Pugh A liver impairment) plus SOC
      or SOC for the next 13 days.

      The study will have 14 days of treatment and 46 days of follow-up.

      Approximately 50 patients are planned to be enrolled in the trial at approximately 8 study
      sites in the US.

    <description>The NEWS is based on a simple aggregate scoring system in which a score is allocated to physiological measurements, already recorded in routine practice, when patients present to, or are being monitored in hospital. Six simple physiological parameters form the basis of the scoring system: respiration rate, oxygen saturation, systolic blood pressure, pulse rate, level of consciousness or new confusion, temperature.</description>
