      In this prospective observational study we aim to study the association of vitamin D
      deficiency with adverse clinical outcomes in patients infected with Coronavirus disease 2019

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can induce an exaggerated inflammatory response. Vitamin
      D is a key modulator of the immune system. We hypothesized that vitamin D deficiency (VDD)
      could increase the risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection. The COVIT-D study (Increased
      risk of severe COVID-19 infection in patients with Vitamin D deficiency) is a prospective
      cohort study recruiting patients with confirmed COVID-19 seen at the emergency department of
      a tertiary hospital. A measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D is obtained at admission and
      follow-up obtained. The primary outcome is a composite of death, admission to the intensive
      care unit, and/or a need for higher oxygen flow than that provided by nasal cannula. The
      primary association between VDD - categorised in groups - and the primary outcome will be
      evaluated with univariate analyses and multivariable logistic regression including the
      following prespecified confounders: age, gender, obesity and chronic kidney disease. The
      estimated sample size is n=500 and the expected inclusion time lapse 3 months.
