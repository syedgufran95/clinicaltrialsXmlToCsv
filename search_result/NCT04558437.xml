  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The epidemic of coronavirus induces a major influx of patients implying a rapid modification
      of the organizations, a work overload and a significant stress for the care teams and
      supports of the hospitals of the Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) . To this is
      added the impact on each professional of the large number of very severe patients to be
      treated, of death and the anxiety of contamination, reinforced by the actual cases of staff
      themselves sick. Emergency phone numbers for professionals in the event of psychological
      suffering were quickly put in place at the AP-HP and Hospitals level. The objective of this
      study is to assess the psychopathological and psycho-traumatic consequences of this
      exceptional situation on the staff, during the epidemic and at a distance from it, in order
      to be able to target the solutions to be implemented. Hypothesis is that some personnel may
      develop one or more of the following disorders: adjustment disorder or other anxiety
      disorder, acute stress disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depressive
      episodes as defined in the DSM-5. This study also aimes to assess effect of support measures
      put in place, by comparing the evolution of those who benefited from those who did not use
      them, as well as the risk factors specific. The results will make it possible to have an
      estimate of the percentage of people who may require specific support, and to identify the
      staff most at risk, and thus predict the importance of the circuits and structures for
      support of staff which will be necessary in the short and long term. The main anticipated
      risk factors are: being a nurse, having a low number of years of professional experience, and
      being on the front line of care for affected patients.
