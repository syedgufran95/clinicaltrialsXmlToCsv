  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), notably when
      handling human samples, remains poorly understood, as well as the impact of the COVID-19
      pandemic in routine clinical and molecular pathology practice, and for personal working in
      pathology laboratories. This study evaluates the consequences of the COVID-19 crisis in
      clinical and molecular pathology laboratories in Europe mostly those orientated for diagnosis
      of thoracic diseases.

    <description>The questionnaire had requested information on the biosafety organization, impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the clinical and molecular pathology and the biobanking activity in thoracic pathology, on the research activity associated with the COVID-19, and on the educational and training organization. It requested the different needs planned by the different laboratories following the COVID-19 crisis and finally the consequence of this latter on the health and virological status of the staff members.</description>
