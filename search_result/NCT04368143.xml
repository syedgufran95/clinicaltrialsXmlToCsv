  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This concerns a single-center prospective interventional cohort study. Laboratory-confirmed
      COVID-19 patients will be asked to donate blood at at least two different timepoints. This
      will allow us to investigate T and B cell evolutions during the course of infection and
      recovery. The expected duration of the study is four months or the total duration of the
      SARS-CoV-2 circulation in Belgium (whichever is shortest).

        The study will be conducted in an in-patient hospital setting. Patients will be recruited
        at UZA, where SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals might present. Patients with (mild)
        respiratory complaints and suspected risk of having contracted SARS-CoV-2 (risk contact
        with confirmed case, travel history to endemic area) will be tested and isolated in
        awaiting laboratory SARS-CoV-2 test results. In case of mild respiratory complaints, people
        will be discharged immediately for home isolation; while patients in need for hospital care
        will be hospital-admitted (in isolation rooms). If SARS-CoV-2 test results return positive,
        these hospitalized patients will be asked to participate in this study.
