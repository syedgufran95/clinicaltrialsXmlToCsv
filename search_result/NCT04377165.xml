  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is a randomised trial in order to determine if &quot;gamification&quot; can result in
      behaviour change for healthcare workers in the residential aged care setting. The app is for
      Age Care and care workers at the front line who are working to protect those most vulnerable
      to COVID-19. There are 2 groups in this trial on group will receive current and accurate
      information from an app. The other group will receives the app with the addition of a
      gamification competent, this will include rewarding experiences for staff doing safety
      behaviours and wellbeing behaviours. The purpose of the gamification is to create a calming
      and reassuring experience that injects positivity and joy where possible during this
      stressful time.

      The study design will be a multi- centre cluster randomised control trial, where Age Care
      facilities are randomised into two groups:

        1. Newsfeed- gets the app with newsfeed only

        2. Gamification group- gets the full gamified app, including the newsfeed Workers in our
           network of residential aged care facilities will be invited to participate in a study of
           communication of information regarding COVID-19 and how they will play a role in
           preventing its spread.
