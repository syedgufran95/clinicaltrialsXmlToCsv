  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, viral pneumonia caused by a novel beta-coronavirus (Covid-19) broke out in
      Wuhan, China. Some patients rapidly progressed and suffered severe acute respiratory failure
      and died, making it imperative to develop a safe and effective vaccine to treat and prevent
      severe Covid-19 pneumonia. Based on detailed analysis of the viral genome and search for
      potential immunogenic targets, a synthetic minigene has been engineered based on conserved
      domains of the viral structural proteins and a polyprotein protease. The infection of
      Covid-19 is mediated through binding of the Spike protein to the ACEII receptor, and the
      viral replication depends on molecular mechanisms of all of these viral proteins. This trial
      proposes to develop and test innovative Covid-19 minigenes engineered based on multiple viral
      genes, using an efficient lentiviral vector system (NHP/TYF) to express viral proteins and
      immune modulatory genes to modify dendritic cells (DCs) and to activate T cells. In this
      study, the safety and efficacy of this LV vaccine (LV-SMENP) will be investigated.

      Background: The 2019 discovered new coronavirus, Covid-19, is an enveloped positive strand
      single strand RNA virus. The number of Covid-19 infected people has increased rapidly and WHO
      has warned that the spread of Covid-19 may soon become pandemic and have disastrous outcomes.
      Covid-19 could pose a serious threat to human health and global economy. There is no vaccine
      available or clinically approved antiviral therapy as yet. This study aims to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of treating Covid-19 infections with a novel lentiviral based DC and T
      cell vaccines.

      Objective: Primary study objectives: Injection and infusion of LV-SMENP DC and
      antigen-specific cytotoxic T cell vaccines to healthy volunteers and Covid-19 infected
      patients to evaluate the safety.

      Secondary study objectives: To evaluate the anti- Covid-19 efficacy of the LV-SMENP DC and
      antigen-specific cytotoxic T cell vaccines.

      Design:

        1. Based on the genomic sequence of the new coronavirus Covid-19, select conserved and
           critical structural and protease protein domains to engineer lentiviral SMENP minigenes
           to express Covid-19 antigens.

        2. LV-SMENP-DC vaccine is made by modifying DC with lentivirus vectors expressing Covid-19
           minigene SMENP and immune modulatory genes. CTLs will be activated by LV-DC presenting
           Covid-19 specific antigens.

        3. LV-DC vaccine and antigen-specific CTLs are prepared in 7~21 days. Subject will receive
           total 5x10^6 cells of LV-DC vaccine and 1x10^8 antigen-specific CTLs via sub-cutaneous
           injection and IV infusion, respectively. Patients are followed weekly for one month
           after the infusion, monthly for 3 months, and then every 3 months until the trial ends.
