  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to analyze the feasibility and effect of an online Therapeutic Exercise and
      Education programme (TEEP) in cancer patient and survivors
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current literature shows that Therapeutic Exercise has multiple benefits in oncology
      patients, such as improvements in function and quality of life, and ameliorates symptoms such
      as cancer-related fatigue. Furthermore, given the risk of obesity, both exercise and diet
      play a key role in recovery from cancer. In fact, current guidelines support the use of
      exercise with therapeutic purposes as a complement to cancer treatment.

      As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, oncology patients present more difficulties to
      attend programs, as the vast majority are immunosuppressed, and they are considered risk
      population. Therefore, new online (TEEP) must be developed to facilitate the benefits of
      these programs in the post-COVID Era. This study analyses the feasibility (in terms of
      suitability and verification of exercise prescription, absence and attendance type, and total
      days of attendance) and the effect (in weight, physical function, and symptoms) in cancer
      patients and survivors.

    <measure>Suitability of exercise intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients are asked before each session to mark in a numerical scale how are they feeling that day to push themselves and get their session well done. From 0 (very well) to 10 (very badly). Higher scores mean a worse feeling.</description>

    <measure>Verification of exercise intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients are asked to score the feeling of perceived effort after the session with the Borg Perceived Exertion scale (6-20). Higher scores mean a worse perceived exertion.</description>

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Cancer-Related Fatigue (CRF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior and after intervention, an average of 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Spanish version of the Piper Fatigue Scale-Revised (PFS-R) will be used. Its total score is the sum of all items (from 0 to 220), with higher values indicate a higher level of fatigue (worse outcome)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Functional capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>prior and after intervention, an average of 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>It will be tested by 30-second Sit-To-Stand Test (30-STS), number of repetitions completed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Upper limb functionality (%)</measure>
    <time_frame>prior and after intervention, an average of 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>the Spanish version of Upper Limb Functional Index (ULFI) questionnaire will be filled online</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Lower limb functionality (%)</measure>
    <time_frame>prior and after intervention, an average of 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>the Spanish version of Lower Limb Functional Index (LLFI) questionnaire will be filled online</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Quality of life (self-reported questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>prior and after intervention, an average of 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>It will be assessed by The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) version 3.0. EORTC QLQ-C30 comprises 30 items and contains five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status/QoL scale, and six single items. Raw scores can be linearly converted to a 0-100 scale with higher scores reflecting higher levels of function (better outcome) and higher levels of symptom show bigger problems (worse outcome).</description>

    <measure>Change from specific Breast Cancer Quality of life (self-reported questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>prior and after intervention, an average of 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>It will be assessed by The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Breast Cancer-Specific Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-BR23). This is a breast cancer module of EORTC QLQ-C30 which contains 23 items that assess disease symptom, side effects of treatment, body image, sexual functioning, and future perspective. All items are rated on a 4-point scale (from 1- not at all, to very much). Higher scores represent better functioning (better outcome), and higher scores of symptom show bigger issues (worse outcome)</description>
