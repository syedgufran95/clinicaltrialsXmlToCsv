  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed rapidly assess safety and preliminary efficacy in hospitalized
      patients with COVID-19 respiratory distress to provide clinical guidance for possible wider
      use in treating patients in this pandemic environment. This data will be used for FDA IND
      filings and pursuit of a BLA.

    <textblock>
      This study is single arm, non-randomized Phase 1 study of the safety and preliminary efficacy
      of PSC-04, an adipose-derived allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell. The outcome data will be
      compared to contemporaneous non-enrolled patients at the same clinical site(s) as the
      enrolled patients.

      Study Objectives:

      Primary: To evaluate the safety of intravenous infusion of allogeneic adipose stem cells in
      patients with COVID-19 disease and respiratory distress.

      Secondary: To evaluate a set of secondary safety and efficacy outcome variables to give
      guidance in assessing the risk/benefit ratio in patients with COVID-19 respiratory distress.
