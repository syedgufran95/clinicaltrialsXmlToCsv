  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus
      2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. This virus was identified in December 2019 in the Chinese city of
      Wuhan, in the province of Hubei, where it determined a state of health emergency proclaimed
      by China on January 30, 2020.

      Since February 2020, Italy has been involved in the emergency of the COVID-19 infection, with
      devastating consequences for the health of the population and the economy of our country. As
      published by the Italian National Institute of Health, the starting date of the symptoms
      dates back to the end of January, the first case diagnosed dates back to 21 February 2020
      while the first cases of home isolation date back to March 1st, 2020. On March 30, 2020,
      there were 101739 positive subjects and 11591 deaths (Civil Protection data).

      According to data published by the World Health Organization, most people with COVID-19
      develop a flu-like form, 14% develop a severe form that requires hospitalization and oxygen
      therapy and 5% require an ICU admission.

      The emergency from Covid19 made it necessary to provide institutional social distancing
      conditions which resulted in rehabilitation departments being prohibited from visiting
      patients by family members and/or caregivers. This event, although necessary, led to the
      first moment of discomfort on the part of patients and family members; to overcome this
      reaction &quot;technological&quot; solutions were found, trying to give continuity to the contact
      between the patient and the family member through the use of video calls. Despite this, the
      COVID-19 emergency and the limitations resulting from social distancing likely have an impact
      on both patients and family members/caregivers that needs to be assessed.

      Aims:

      The study aims to measure the quality of life (QoL) and the emotional-affective sphere of
      patients, currently hospitalized in residential structures, and their family members.

      The study data will allow identifying (a) whether the social distancing between family
      members/caregivers and patients undergoing rehabilitation for orthopedic or neurological
      disabilities affects the quality of life and the emotional-affective sphere and (b) if these
      conditions change over time. The data obtained will, therefore, allow identifying those
      subjects who present a particular fragility of the emotional-affective sphere and who
      therefore need attention and possibly psychological support that will be prescribed.

      Procedures:

      Demographic (for patients and caregivers) and anamnestic (only for patients) data will be
      collected; moreover, disability will be assessed in patients using the modified Barthel
      index.

      Three questionnaires will be administered to patients and caregivers:

        -  The Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF36), to evaluate the QoL;

        -  The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), to evaluate the emotional state;

        -  The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), to evaluate mood.

      These questionnaires will be administered after one month of hospitalization (T0), and after
      one (T1) and two (T2) months after T0. Finally, at time T1 and T2 it will be registered if
      the patient is still hospitalized or discharged (and in the latter case the days between the
      discharge and the compilation of the questionnaire will be recorded). Since the three
      selected questionnaires provide for self-administration, to simplify the collection of data
      relating to caregivers, the implementation and use of an online questionnaire will be
      assessed. This questionnaire will also provide for the collection of consent to the use of
      data by the subject and will guarantee their privacy.
