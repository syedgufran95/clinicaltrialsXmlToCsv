      Statement :

        -  The emerging Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease, linked to the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen, has
           been spreading worldwide since December 2019, affecting millions of people and causing
           hundreds of thousands of deaths, particularly among the elderly.

        -  The first epidemiological evidence available reveals a different expression of the
           disease in the elderly, associated with a high risk of delayed diagnosis and
           implementation of protective measures and a particularly high morbidity and mortality,
           especially among the frailest.

        -  To date, there is no effective model for predicting the severity of COVID-19 in an
           individual.

      The investigators hypothesize that there are specificities of COVID-19 in the elderly, both
      etiological, diagnostic and prognostic, all of which are not yet known and understood.

    <description>Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is defined as a multidisciplinary diagnostic and treatment process that identifies medical, psychosocial, and functional capabilities of an older adult in order to develop a coordinated plan to maximize overall health with aging. CGA is based on the premise that a systematic evaluation of frail older persons by a team of health professionals may identify a variety of treatable health problems and lead to better health outcomes.</description>
