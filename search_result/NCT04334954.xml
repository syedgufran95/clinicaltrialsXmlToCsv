      Background:

      Respiratory virus outbreaks and pandemics, such as SARS, MERS, and the new SARS-COV2 virus,
      have major impacts worldwide. Researchers must act quickly to learn about the exposures and
      immunity in the general population. This can be done by studying people s blood serum to find
      those with antibodies to the virus. This knowledge can help in current and future pandemics.
      In this study, researchers want to find people who have anti-SARS-COV2 antibodies but no
      known exposure or illness.

      Objective:

      To find the number of people with detectable antibodies to SARS-COV2 from a sampling of
      adults who have no known exposure or clinical illness.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18 and older without a confirmed COVID19 infection or current symptoms consistent
      with COVID19

      Design:

      Participants will enroll and give consent over the phone. They will be screened over the
      phone with a health assessment questionnaire. They will be screened for COVID19 using the NIH
      COVID19 screening questionnaire.

      Participants will give a blood sample. They can go to the NIH Clinical Center or do home
      blood sampling. In-person collection at NIH is preferred.

      If participants go to NIH, 2 tubes of blood will be taken.

      If participants do home sampling, they will be sent a home sampling kit. The kit contains
      gauze, an alcohol pad, a lancet, collection devices, and shipping materials. It also contains
      detailed instructions. They will collect 80ul of blood and mail it to the NIH lab.

      Participants may enroll in the study up to 4 times. They cannot enroll within 30 days of
      previous enrollment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated that respiratory virus outbreaks and pandemics, such as influenza,
      SARS, MERS, and now the newly emerged SARS-COV2 virus, have a major impact on morbidity and
      mortality worldwide, as well as having devastating global economic and societal impact.
      During these outbreaks it is critical to gain a rapid understanding of the exposures and
      immunity in the general population. Identifying exposures can be accomplished through
      analysis of serum during an outbreak to identify those with specific antibodies to the
      pathogen. The knowledge of the level of exposures could greatly impact the response to
      current and future pandemics. In this natural history study, we will collect blood from
      individuals to identify those who have anti-SARS-COV2 antibodies present despite no confirmed
      disease or known exposures.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. &gt;= 18 years of age.

               2. Willing and able to complete a verbal telephone consent.

               3. Willing to undergo one blood draw or home blood sampling.

               4. Willing to have blood samples stored for future research.

               5. Have previously participated in Phase 1 of this study (inclusion for Phase II
                  only)

        Co-enrollment Guidelines

        Participants may be co-enrolled in other research studies.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Confirmed history of COVID19 infection or exposure (exclusion for Phase I only)

          2. Current symptoms consistent with COVID19 infection

          3. Any condition or event that, in the PI s opinion, may substantially increase the risk
             associated with study participation or compromise the study's scientific objectives.
             Conditions that exclude a subject are considered to be unlikely, but an example would
             include having a blood clotting disorder that would make it unsafe to obtain blood
             samples.

          4. Not willing to have blood samples stored for future research.
