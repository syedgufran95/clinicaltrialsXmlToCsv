      This study aims to advance research on group sessions for mental health. The
      first-of-its-kind study measuring various features in a group setting, combining rich
      metadata in creating state-of-the-art machine learning models, and developing workflows for
      mental health that are both scalable and personalized.

      The anticipated impact of this study is defining voice biomarker features and reward
      functions for a deep reinforcement learning based system from group interactions that improve
      depression and anxiety outcomes. The investigators' ability to quantify the real-time impact
      of human-intervention in scaled group video sessions can be very meaningful for creating best
      practices in the area where measurement is infrequent.

      The investigators' priority is to scale the optimal mix of individuals for group therapy
      sessions based on reward functions that maximize improvements in depression and anxiety
      scores. Current group therapy appointments may track little save few who use various group
      feedback questionnaires (e.g. OQ, GCQ, or GQ). Voice biomarkers can play a key role in the
      real-time measurement of mental health.

      The proposed work is to conduct a feasibility study on creating reward functions that most
      effectively enable engagement for group sessions as measured by voice biomarkers before,
      during, and after group video meetings.
