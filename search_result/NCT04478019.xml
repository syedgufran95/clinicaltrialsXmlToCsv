  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthcare workers in Wisconsin caring for critically ill COVID-19 patients will be most
      impacted by the proposed project. Evidence has shown that the SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus is
      easily transmissable through close contact between individuals, especially during
      aerosol-generating procedures such as intubation of patients. The intervention proposed in
      this study (nasal and oral decontamination with povidone-iodine and chlorhexidine,
      respectively) presents an opportunity for a safe, effective, and feasible treatment to
      decontaminate the primary entry points for SARS-CoV-2. As such, the intervention to be
      studied in this project may protect healthcare workers by preventing transmission of
      SARS-CoV-2 from patients to healthcare workers, and thus reducing the incidence of COVID-19
      in these healthcare workers.
