  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brazil has the Latin America's largest coronavirus outbreak, numbers second only to the
      United States in the western hemisphere. The first COVID-19 confirmed case in Brazil was on
      February of 2020. A 61yrs old man tested positive after returning from a trip to Italy. Few
      other very first cases were also imported from Europe by returning travelers. The first
      locally transmitted case was registered on March of 2020, when a total of 8 cases have
      already been confirmed. At the time the WHO declares the outbreak as a pandemic (March 11)
      Brazil had 52 confirmed cases being 6 of those locally transmitted.

      Healthcare professionals are now more important than ever. Given the intrinsic nature of the
      hands-on treatment of the Chiropractic profession, it is extremely important to understand
      what strategies chiropractors have put in place to address patient care, safety, and self
      report COVID contamination of those professionals.
