    <textblock>
      Phase 2a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial of EIDD-2801 in adult
      men and women who have tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2
      (SARS-CoV-2) infection within 48 hours of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmation and
      are hospitalized with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Rapid enrollment and treatment will be
      initiated such that the first dose of EIDD-2801 or placebo will be administered as soon as
      possible and within 7 days of onset of symptoms.

      Stratified randomization of participants who will receive remdesivir at enrollment and those
      who will not receive remdesivir at enrollment.
