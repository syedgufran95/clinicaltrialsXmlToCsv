      The COPE Trial is a randomized controlled trial that will provide currently isolated yet
      generally physically healthy 18-64 year old adults who are pre-retirement with the
      opportunity to receive a free 3-month subscription to either a yoga or moderate-to-high
      intensity aerobic exercise app or be randomized to a waitlist control group. Study outcomes
      include measures of psychological wellbeing and physical health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Global stay-at-home mandates implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are having
      substantial negative effects on mental health. Developing approaches to maintain the mental
      health of all individuals during this unprecedented time of physical distancing is of
      paramount importance. In the proposed low cost randomized controlled trial (RCT), the
      investigators seek to answer whether the use of a mobile app that provides a variety of
      physical activities appropriate for home workouts [i.e., high intensity interval training
      (HIIT), yoga] can improve wellbeing and health in adults mandated to stay at home. Should the
      results of this trial support the efficacy of the intervention (via app delivery), this has
      the potential to be implemented and delivered rapidly and at scale.

      Engaging in regular physical activity confers reduced risk for mental disorders (e.g.
      depression, anxiety) in clinical and non-clinical populations. The investigators' recent
      evidence also suggests that becoming physically active reduces depressive symptoms, as well
      as negative affect and rumination on a daily basis, while improving daily positive affect and
      a sense of control in highly stressed adults. With fitness centres currently closed by
      mandate, becoming physically active during the COVID-19 pandemic could prove to be a
      challenge for individuals who are typically inactive, those mandated to stay-at-home, or
      those who do not have opportunities to access outdoor spaces that provide the recommended two
      meters of distance between people. Thus, the investigators seek to support those living under
      stay-at-home mandates with access to mobile apps that provide opportunities to be physically
      active in the home environment.

      The study will focus on physical activities requiring little physical space or equipment that
      are easily completed at home. The study includes yoga, a movement-based activity that
      promotes relaxation and mindfulness and only requires space for the full length and width of
      one's body, and a mat as equipment. Yoga has been shown to be effective in improving physical
      function and quality of life in RCTs. The study also includes whole body weight (WBW)-based
      HIIT, which also only requires a mat, making it an excellent home-based form of aerobic
      exercise. HIIT is characterized as bouts of high-intensity exercise combined with periods of
      recovery or lower intensity activity. Its physical and psychological benefits compared to
      continuous moderate intensity training are often evidenced to be equal or significantly
      stronger.

      Aims. The primary outcome will be a measure of depressive symptomology. It is hypothesized
      that those who actively use the yoga and/or WBW-HIIT mobile apps will improve in their
      depressive symptomatology compared to the waitlist control group over the course of the
      6-week RCT. The study will also include measures of, as secondary outcomes, psychological
      distress, quality of life, and self-reported physical health, and expect decreases in
      distress and increases in the remaining outcomes. The researchers will also investigate
      whether effects are stronger in those (a) who currently live alone vs. live with others, or
      (b) with poorer levels of psychological health pre-randomization.

    <measure>Changes in psychological distress as measured by the K10 over the course of the exercise intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>Tracked weekly for 7 weeks (baseline, followed by 6 weeks of exercise intervention) and then a final survey at week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The 10 Item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) will be used in the baseline survey and in each weekly survey to track changes in psychological distress over the study period. The K10 measures general psychological distress, typically over the last 30 days, but the investigators will be using the survey on a weekly basis to track changes potentially related to the exercise intervention. Scores range from 10-50, with higher scores indicating more symptoms or more frequent experience of those symptoms. Scores are weighted by how often the symptoms are experienced in a period of time, which in this case is the previous 7 days.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in life satisfaction over the course of the exercise intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Tracked weekly for 7 weeks (baseline, followed by 6 weeks of exercise intervention) and then a final survey at week 12</time_frame>
    <description>A Life Satisfaction item, consisting of three questions, will be used in the baseline and weekly surveys to track changes over the study period. The first item is scored 0-10, with 10 indicating &quot;the best possible life overall&quot;. Two follow-up questions asking individuals to rate their physical and mental/emotional health on a five point scale from poor to excellent. Higher scores overall indicate more satisfaction with life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in weekly strain as a result of health problems, financial/work issues, and relationship trouble using the Chronic Burden Scale over the course of the exercise intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>Tracked weekly for 7 weeks (baseline, followed by 6 weeks of exercise intervention) and then a final survey at week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Chronic Burden Scale (CBS) is an eight-item question asking about how much perceived strain individuals have experienced over the last week. This includes health problems with themselves, family members, and/or others close to them; problems with their job or ability to work; financial strain; and problems with relationships. There is a possible score of 8-32, with lower scores indicating less perceived strain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in general affect over the course of the exercise intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Tracked weekly for 7 weeks (baseline, followed by 6 weeks of exercise intervention) and then a final survey at week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Using the positive and negative affect scale and a scale developed by Mroczek and Kolarz (1998) the investigators will be tracking participants affect. There are 25 items, scored 1 (felt all the time) to 5 (felt none of the time), with 13 negative affect and 18 positive affect items. PANAS Positive and negative affect will be considered separately, as will the positive items from Mroczek and Kolarz's measure, such that in each case higher scores will indicate higher amounts of positive or negative affect, respectively.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in leisure time physical activity over the course of the exercise intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Tracked weekly for 7 weeks (baseline, followed by 6 weeks of exercise intervention) and then a final survey at week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators are tracking leisure time physical activity at baseline, and weekly (outside of the exercise intervention) using a version of the leisure score index (LSI) that was modified from the original LSI that was part of Godin's Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ). This question is open-ended and allows participants to tell us the frequency per week and time per exercise session of any mild, moderate, or strenuous exercise the participants have completed.</description>

    <time_frame>Tracked weekly for 7 weeks (baseline, followed by 6 weeks of exercise intervention) and then a final survey at week 12</time_frame>
    <description>A Physical Health item will be used in the baseline and weekly surveys to track changes in physical health (e.g. headache, backache, fever, sore throat, fatigue etc.) over the course of the study period. There are 13 physical symptoms, with the scoring based on how many symptoms were experienced in the past week. The scoring range is 0-13, with higher numbers indicating experiencing more negative physical health symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in alcohol habits over the course of the exercise intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Tracked weekly for 7 weeks (baseline, followed by 6 weeks of exercise intervention) and then a final survey at week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Using a 2-item alcohol habits question the investigators are tracking any changes in participants alcohol behaviours. Participants are asked if they drank at all in the last week, and if so, how many days per week they consumed alcohol. This is a modified version of the CDC's Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance.</description>
