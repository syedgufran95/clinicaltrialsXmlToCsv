  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the impact of hydroxychloroquine in hospitalized patients
      with COVID-19 and risk factors for severe/critical disease.

    <textblock>
      This study will utilize a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded design. Patients
      admitted with confirmed COVID-19, and at least 1 of the following: requiring oxygen
      supplementation (≤4 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula or increase from baseline), bilateral
      infiltrates on CT/CXR, age &gt;65, diabetes, hypertension, BMI &gt; 35, chronic lung disease,
      cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, cancer (hematologic malignancies, lung
      cancer, and metastatic disease), will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to hydroxychloroquine
      400 mg PO BID x 2 doses, then 200 mg PO BID x 8 doses or placebo at a matching schedule.

    <description>The impact will be evaluated by comparing rates of a composite primary outcome in patients randomized to hydroxychloroquine versus those randomized to placebo. The composite outcome includes progression to severe/critical disease or death (including withdrawal of care/hospice transfer). Progression to severe/critical disease is defined by requiring oxygen delivery via high flow nasal cannula, non-rebreather mask, bipap, or transfer to intensive care (ICU) or intermediate care units (IMCU) due to COVID-19-related complications.</description>
