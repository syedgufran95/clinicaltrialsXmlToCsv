  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      People who get infected with COVID-19 have an unpredictable risk to worsen and die. This
      makes it hard to decide who can quarantine at home and who should be treated at a hospital.
      Researchers think the risk may be related to how a person s B and T cells respond to the
      virus. B and T cells are the major components of a person s immune response. B and T cells
      responding to the virus with a favorable pattern may lead to recovery, and this favorable
      pattern may be helpful to establish. If people in a vaccine trial get this same favorable
      pattern when responding to a vaccine, this may be a useful early signal that the vaccine will
      be successful.

      Objective:

      To examine how immune cells respond to COVID-19 infection.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18 and older who have a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection or had COVID-19
      in the past.

      Also, healthy donors with no suspected COVID-19 infection

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with medical record review.

      Participants will be tested with a research assay to determine who was infected with COVID-19
      and who was not. This test will be used to understand research results, not to advise
      patients.

      Participants with active infection must be isolated, usually in a hospital.

      Other participants may give blood samples at NIH or at their local doctor s office or lab.

      Participants may give blood samples up to three times a week for a total of ten times, and
      may also give blood samples after starting a vaccine trial.

      Participants will be contacted by phone or email every 2 months for up to 2 years.

      Background:

        -  Patients infected with COVID-19 have an unpredictable risk to worsen and die, making it
           difficult to decide who can quarantine at home and who should be monitored for
           respiratory failure as an inpatient. This risk may be related in part to the patient s
           immune response which can be characterized with respect to the B- and T-cell repertoire.
           Determining patterns of immune response which correlate with clinically effective
           immunity may help in determining risk.

        -  Patients receiving a vaccine for COVID-19 are tested for antibody production, but
           ultimately protection from infection and survival are the most important endpoints,
           which will take time. If patients can be checked for a pre-defined favorable pattern of
           immune response, it may significantly speed selection of effective candidate vaccines.

        -  In patients with hematologic malignancies, including patients with hairy cell leukemia
           (HCL) who we have extensive experience treating, we do not know if we should be steering
           away more from treatments which harm B-cell immunity, like rituximab or obinutuzumab, or
           steering away more from treatments which harm T-cell immunity, like purine analogs.
           Characterizing the immune response in COVID-19 patients will quickly answer this
           question.

      Objective:

      - To characterize immune response in patients with current or prior COVID-19 infection

      Eligibility:

        -  Age 18 years or older

        -  Patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection, or normal donors (i.e., those
           individuals without COVID-19)

      Design:

        -  Blood and urine samples will be collected for research to characterize immune response.

        -  In individuals with known current or prior COVID-19, samples will be obtained up to
           every three days but no more than 10 times overall during the acute phase of infection
           and after recovery. In individuals without COVID-19 at the time of enrollment (i.e.,
           normal donors), samples will be collected once; in the case of future COVID-19
           infection, samples may be collected at the same times during/post-infection as an
           individual with COVID-19 at enrollment.

        -  All subjects will be followed for approximately 2 years. An additional blood sample may
           be collected in all subjects at one additional time after the receipt of future
           COVID-19- related vaccination.

        -  This protocol does not involve treatment. The accrual ceiling is set at 150 subjects.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Individuals with COVID-19

        - Desire of the patient or normal donor not to submit samples, or medical contraindication
        to sending samples.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Normal Donors

        - Immunosuppressive treatments, such as cytotoxic chemotherapy and current rituximab which
