  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to capture data, laboratory markers, and clinical outcomes of
      obstetric and neonatal outcomes in cases of COVID-19 during pregnancy in Cuyahoga County.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A review of the 55 cases of obstetric COVID-19 cases world-wide demonstrate the following
      fetal complications of COVID-19: miscarriage (2%), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR;
      10%), pre-eclampsia, and pre-term birth (39%). In Wuhan, China, nine women who were COVID-19
      positive were surveilled for vertical transmission and overall obstetric and early neonatal
      outcomes. Amniotic fluid, umbilical cord blood, and neonatal throat swabs were collected at
      the time of delivery, and breastmilk samples were collected after lactation commenced. There
      was no viral detection of COVID-19 demonstrated.2 However, two neonates in the United Kingdom
      have tested positively for COVID-19 after delivery from an infected mother. Most recently,
      antibodies were detected (IgM and IgG) in the serum of a neonate born via cesarean delivery
      to a known positive mother. Therefore, vertical transmission has not been completely ruled
      out.

      Additionally, infection at varying times of pregnancy has not been well delineated or
      correlated to neonatal or maternal outcomes at time of delivery. Therefore, there is a need
      to continue surveying and documenting clinical findings in obstetric COVID-19 cases.

      This study will follow pregnant women who are diagnosed during any point of their pregnancy
      with COVID-19. The aim will be to evaluate maternal and neonatal specimens for the presence
      of COVID-19 virus, immune and cellular response.
