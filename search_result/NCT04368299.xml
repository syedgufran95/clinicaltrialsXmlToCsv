    <textblock>
      Background Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) might be more susceptible to
      Covid-19 due to the underlying disease, co-morbidities and the use of immunosuppressive
      drugs. The investigators hypothesize that telemedicine (TM) can be an effective mode of
      health-care delivery minimizing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, while maintaining disease
      control in these patients.

      Objectives The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness to achieve
      remission or lupus low disease activity state (LLDAS) using TM delivered care compared to
      conventional in-person outpatient follow-up in SLE. The secondary objectives are to compare
      the patient reported outcomes and cost between the two modes of health care delivery.

      Study design This is a 12-months single centered pragmatic randomized controlled study. A
      total of 150 enrolled patients with SLE being followed at the Prince of Wales Hospital
      rheumatology clinics will be randomized to either TM (TM group) or standard care (SC group)
      in a 1:1 ratio. Patients in the TM group will receive scheduled follow-ups via
      videoconferencing using a custom-made mobile app. SC group patients will continue
      conventional standard in-person outpatient care. The disease and patient reported outcomes as
      well as the health care related costs will be compared.

      Expected outcomes Data from this study will support the notion that TM based care is as
      effective as conventional in-person care in achieving disease remission or LLDAS, as well as
      addressing psychosocial implications to ensure the best possible care for our patients in a
      cost-effective manner during this pandemic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a single-center pragmatic randomized controlled trial over a 12-month period. The
      study will be performed at the Rheumatology clinics at the Prince of Wales Hospital, which is
      a regional hospital in Hong Kong.

      From May to October 2020, all consecutive patients with a diagnosis of SLE according to the
      2019 European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology classification
      criteria will be invited to participate in the study if they are aged &gt;18 years, able to
      speak or understand Chinese and are willing to come back for routine blood and urine tests
      [18]. Patients (or carers) need to possess the technology needed to conduct a TM visit - a
      smartphone, tablet, or computer. Patients will be excluded if they are pregnant or incapable
      of answering a questionnaire. Patients will be randomization to either TM (TM group) or
      standard follow-ups (SF group 1). Patients who refused to be randomized will be offered
      standard in-person outpatient follow-up (SF group 2). All patients who fulfill the inclusion
      criteria and have given written informed consent will be asked to complete the Systemic Lupus
      Activity Questionnaire (SLAQ), LupusPRO, Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index
      (HAQ-DI), Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form (SF-36), Functional Assessment of Chronic
      Illness Therapy (FACIT) Fatigue Scale (version 4) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
      (HADS). They will also be asked to rate the confidence to the mode of care on a 10-point
      Likert scale (0 = not at all confident to 10 = very much confident). Their demographic,
      socio-economic and clinical data will be collected. Patient will be randomized in a ratio of
      1:1 to either TM group or SF group 1 using a computer-generated random number sequence.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>LupusQoL evaluates 8 domains including physical health, pain, planning, intimate relationships, burden to others, emotional health, body image, and fatigue. Questionnaire has a 5-point Likert response format (0=all the time, 1=most of the time, 2=a good bit of the time, 3=occasionally, and 4=never). Higher score means better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>The change of (Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index HAQ-DI) at one year.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ-DI covers various common daily activities to assess disability.It consists of 8 questions. Each question asks on a scale ranging from 0 to 3 if the categories can be performed without any difficulty (scale 0) up to cannot be done at all (scale 3). Higher score means higher disability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) HADS at one year.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>HADS was developed to assess anxiety and depression in medical patients. Each domain has 7 items. Each item are answered by the patient on a four point (0-3) response category so the possible scores ranged from 0 to 21 for anxiety and 0 to 21 for depression. Higher score means more likely the patient has anxiety or depression.</description>
