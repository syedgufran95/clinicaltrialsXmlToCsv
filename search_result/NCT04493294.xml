      Background: Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) carry a high mortality rate among older
      patients and minorities such as ethnic Africans and Latinos. The chronic baseline systemic
      inflammation of older patients and minorities may make them more vulnerable to the cytokines
      storm generated by the viral infection in addition to preexisting co-morbidity.

      Even though multiple organs failure result from the cytokine storm, pneumonia and respiratory
      failure often lead to death. Low dose whole lung radiotherapy (LDWLRT) may modulate the
      inflammatory response and may decrease the need for artificial ventilation, thus improving
      mortality rate.

      Methods: A phase I-II prospective trials enrolling 500 patients, 65 years old or older from
      26 countries will be conducted to investigate the impact of LDWLRT on mortality rate of
      COVID-19 patients. The patients who will be selected would have developed pneumonias but did
      not require artificial ventilation. These patients will be followed for a year after
      receiving this treatment. Their physical activities will be monitored through the ordinal
      scale and will be correlated with their cytokines status and oxygen saturation rate to assess
      the impact of the residual inflammation on their daily life. Mortality rates between
      different ethnic group will be compared and correlated with their cytokines response to the
      virus and number of co-morbidities.

      Discussion and importance of the study: We postulate that LDWLRT may improve survival rates
      of all patients by preventing the need for artificial ventilation which is associated with a
      high mortality. The inflammatory response between different ethnic groups before and
      following radiotherapy will be valuable to serve as baseline for future prospective pandemic
      studies as it has not been reported before.
