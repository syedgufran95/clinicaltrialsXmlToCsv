  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center observational autopsy study, conducted during the first wave of the
      coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in France. The main objective is to evaluate brain
      damages in patients who died from COVID-19 to inform the cause of death. Investigations
      include macroscopic and histology examinations, and virology analyses.

      Setting: academic center designed as a referral center for patients with COVID-19 Design:
      single center observational autopsy study Participants: intensive care unit (ICU) adults who
      died from confirmed COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic in France.

      Oversight: As per legal health authority requirement only patients with suspected or
      confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)- related to coronavirus 2 infection were
      admitted to the ICU. The department of pathology and forensic medicine is allowed by legal
      authority to perform autopsy of non-survivors from COVID-19 to inform the cause of death as
      per ministerial decree of July 12 2017 and March 28, 2020. In this context, of autopsy for
      medical purpose and public interest there is no requirement for institutional review board
      submission. However, consent from patients legal representative or closest relatives is
      required for autopsy.

    <description>The left hemisphere will be fixed in 10% buffered formalin. Multiple fresh samples will be acquired from different areas of the right hemisphere for freezing. For each frozen sample, a mirror sample of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue will be taken from the left hemisphere. Samples were fixed with 3.6% glutaraldehyde and embedded in plastic for electron microscopy. Paraffin sections cut to 3-µm thickness will be stained with hematoxylin and eosin stain. Immunohistochemistry will be performed with Clusters of Differentiation 3,4, 20, 68, 138, and glial fibrillary acid protein antibodies on automated immunostainer. Slides will be scanned and analyzed. Electron microscopy will be performed and images will be acquired.</description>
