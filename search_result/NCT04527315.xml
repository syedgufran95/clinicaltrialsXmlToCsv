  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is associated with acute pulmonary and cardiac injury. To better understand the
      degree and severity of cardiopulmonary injury as well as short and long-term sequelae of
      COVID-19 infection, this study will perform longitudinal study in patients who had recent
      known diagnosis of COVID-19.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives for this study include providing structural and function information about
      lung and heart using chest imaging, MRI, Echo, Spirometry, and blood markers in order to
      assess severity of cardiopulmonary injury and short- and long-term sequelae of COVID-19
      infection as well as assess indicators of mental health and quality of life.

        Patients who have had a positive COVID-19 test, but were not hospitalized/admitted will
        also be identified and eligible to participate in the study. Age and sex matched controls
        will also be recruited from those with no clinical history of COVID-19.
