      Background:

      COVID-19 virus infection differs among people. Some people have no or mild symptoms. For
      others, COVID-19 is life threatening and causes damage to the body s organs. Researchers want
      to better understand the virus to learn how to kill it.

      Objective:

      To understand how the COVID-19 virus causes wide differences in how sick one can become from
      the infection.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18-80 with COVID-19 infection

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a review of their medical records.

      Participants who enter the study at the beginning of their COVID-19 infection will stay in
      the hospital until they are healthy enough to go home. Those who enter after they have
      recovered may need to stay in the hospital 1-2 nights to perform the study tests.

      Participants will have MRI and CT scans of the brain, heart, and lungs. They will lie in a
      machine that takes pictures of the body. For the MRI, soft padding or a coil will be placed
      around their head and chest. They may receive a dye injected into a vein.

      Participants will have an ultrasound of the kidneys and heart.

      Participants will provide blood and urine samples. They will provide nasal swabs.

      Participants will have a bronchoscopy. A thin tube will be placed through the nose or mouth
      into the airway. Saltwater will be squirted into the lungs and removed by suction.

      Participants may provide a spinal fluid sample. A needle injected into the spinal canal will
      obtain fluid.

      Participants will have lung and heart function tests.

      At various points after recovery, participants will repeat many of these tests.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is little sequential, methodically collected data on patients with COVID-19 that can be
      correlated with the severity of disease or the long-term sequelae. Such information is
      necessary to understand how to most logically intervene with directly acting antiviral agents
      and immunologic response modifiers. The variability of the clinical course of patients who
      may be asymptomatic throughout their clinical course to those patients who develop
      progressive multisystem organ failure represents a challenge to understand the host and viral
      factors that result in these dramatically different outcomes.

      This protocol will enroll patients to the Clinical Center in a longitudinal study using
      granular clinical, laboratory, and imaging data including extensive pulmonary and cardiac
      functional assessments, neurologic evaluation, comprehensive immunologic evaluations, and
      innovative imaging. In patients with COVID-19 infection, linking sequential analysis of
      blood, urine and bronchoalveolar lavage with simultaneous cardiopulmonary imaging can provide
      novel insights into mechanisms associated with the initiation, progression and resolution of
      lung, cardiac and systemic inflammation. These mechanisms are presumed to be essential in the
      pathogenesis and survival from this infection. This information will help guide diagnostic
      and therapeutic innovation and assess long-term consequences of this infection.

        Subjects 18-80 years old, male or female will be enrolled within 14 - 28 days of documented
        COVID-19 infection for acute care OR during recovery and convalescent phase of the acute
        illness (day 28 and beyond) if care has been received at a facility outside of NIH. Subject
        will be from the MDV medtropolitan area.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        In order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the
        following criteria:

        Subjects within 1-28 days of documented COVID-19 infection for acute care:

          -  Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the
             duration of the study

          -  Male or female, aged 18 to 80 years

               -  Only a minority of children and adolescents have been described as developing
                  serious illness with COVID-19 infection. As such, this is not an age group at
                  significant risk from complications due to this infection. Adults older than 80
                  years of age represent a group with the greatest risk of mortality from COVID-19
                  infection. The presence of significant co-morbidities requiring care that cannot
                  be

        provided at the CC would present a disadvantage to them to have their acute care provided
        for in the CC.

          -  Documentation of positive SARSCoV-19 test by nucleic acid detection (COVID-19
             infection , RT-PCR)

          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed
             consent document.

        Subjects during recovery phase of the acute illness (day 28 and beyond) if care has been
        received at a facility outside of NIH:

          -  Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the
             duration of the study

          -  Male or female, aged 18 to 80 years

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation
        in this study:

          -  Pregnancy or lactation

          -  Serious mental illness (e.g. schizophrenia, manic depression) that would limit the
             ability of the participant to participate willingly into the study.

             --The conduct of the study requires participation in studies that may be unduly
             stressful (e.g. MRI, bronchoscopy).

          -  Severe claustrophobia that would prohibit the conduct of imaging by MRI even if
             sedation is provided.

          -  Patients requiring mechanical ventilation at an outside hospital prior to transfer.
             Transporting these patients adds risk to their care.
