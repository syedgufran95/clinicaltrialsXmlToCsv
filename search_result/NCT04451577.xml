  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study cohort will be enrolled among all Humanitas group employees (including ICH,
      Humanitas University and Gavazzeni), and two validation cohorts. Participants will be asked
      consent for the research use of blood, pharyngeal swab, and for those hospitalized for
      COVID-19, also for the bronchoalveolar lavage and fecal samples. Biological samples will be
      used to perform cellular, microbial and molecular analyses aimed at better understanding the
      disease pathogenesis and the individual differences in susceptibility to the disease.

      The analysis will include:

        -  study the expression levels of molecules known to mediated viral infection, like the
           Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and genetic variants in these genes, which could
           be related to susceptibility to the viral infection and/or to the severity of the
           clinical course of the disease

        -  compare the frequency of genetic variants potentially related with COVID-19
           susceptibility/severity in different subgroups of patients, ranging from individuals
           positive for the virus but asymptomatic to individuals affected by COVID-19 with ARDS
           requiring admission to ICU

        -  germline DNA analysis to search for genetic factors predisposing or protecting against
           severe pulmonary affection in COVID-19 infected participants. To this aim DNA will be
           analyzed by a GWAS (Genome Wide Association Study) approach by using the GSA Illumina
           chip. The obtained data will also be used to try to develop a polygenic risk score to
           stratify individuals with a particularly high or low risk for severe disease course

        -  explore the contribution of rare variants by studying the exome

        -  sepsis and ARDS biomarkers developed at ICH (e.g. PTX3, sIL-1R2, MSF) analysis to
           address their prognostic potential in Covid-19 patients

        -  PBMC analysis by FACS to investigate the immunophenotype and correlate it to the
           clinical outcome

        -  microbiota analysis of residual BAL and pharyngeal swab to evaluate whether different
           microbial or metabolome profiles are associated to worsen disease or to protection

        -  plasma and saliva/sputum test for anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies (IgM, IgG, IgE and IgA) and
           for microbiota analysis

employees that are Sars-Cov-2 positive both symptomatic and asymptomatic, there will be at least 2 peripheral blood samples (5 and 3 ml) at every control visit until ascertained negativity. They will also undergo a pharyngeal swab for viral titers and microbiota analysis at enrollment and at negativity. In addition, a sample of saliva/sputum will be collected for most of the employees at positivity and at every control visit.
For employees hospitalized but not requiring intensive care the following samples will be collected:
an aliquot of samples from the respiratory tract (e.g., bronchial aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage) residual from the normal clinical practice
