  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This questionnaire is distributed via a mailing list (e-mail) of patients treated within the
      framework of the FHU for pathologies including chronic inflammatory bowel diseases or IBD
      (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), inflammatory rheumatic diseases (such as rheumatoid
      arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis), but also asthma, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis as well
      as systemic autoimmune (such as scleroderma, lupus, angioedema) and neurological (multiple
      sclerosis) diseases.

      A two-step analysis will be conducted: impact of lock down(March 17, 2020 - May 11, 2020) and
      a 2-month assessment of end of lock down (from May 11, 2020) on issues addressing: overall
      impact, impact on the disease, treatment and follow-up, and access to information related to
      the epidemic during these periods.
