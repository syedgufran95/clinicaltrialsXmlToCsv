  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will enroll subjects with a clinical
      diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by laboratory testing. Eligible subjects will be randomized
      to either CAP-1002 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Intravenous administration of CAP-1002 or
      placebo will occur at the clinical site on Day 1 and Day 7 (± 1 day) for a maximum of 2
      doses, based on clinical course. Subjects will complete Screening, a Treatment Phase and a
      Follow-up Phase. The Treatment Phase is variable based on each subject's clinical status
      while the subject remains in the hospital and will contain either one or two treatment
      periods.

      Baseline safety and efficacy assessments will be conducted prior to the first infusion.
      Follow-up will be conducted on Day 15 and Day 30 from the first infusion in Treatment Period
      1. Subjects will be observed during the index hospitalization and monitored for outcome and
      safety. Transthoracic echocardiograms will be performed when indicated by clinical or
      laboratory evidence of cardiac involvement during the index hospitalization. Use of any
      concomitant medications to treat COVID-19 will be documented.

      Stopping rules on the subject-level and study-level have been defined to ensure subjects are
      not exposed to significant risk. Oversight of the trial will be provided by independent
      Clinical Event Committee (CEC), Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), and Medical Monitor.

    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will enroll subjects with a clinical
      diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by laboratory testing. Prior to protocol procedures, informed
      consent will be obtained from the subject or a legally authorized representative. Eligible
      subjects will be randomized to either CAP-1002 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Intravenous
      administration of CAP-1002 or placebo will occur at the clinical site on Day 1 and Day 7 (± 1
      day) for a maximum of 2 doses, based on clinical course.

      Subjects will complete Screening, a Treatment Phase and a Follow-up Phase. A detailed medical
      history will be collected, including the presence of any co-morbidities and risk factors
      believed to be associated with COVID-19 outcomes (e.g., age, gender, diabetes, COPD or
      respiratory conditions, body mass index, cardiovascular or renal disease) or emergent factors
      since the time of infection. The Treatment Phase is variable based on each subject's clinical
      status while the subject remains in the hospital and will contain either one or two treatment
      periods. Baseline safety and efficacy assessments will be conducted prior to the first
      infusion. Follow-up will be conducted on Day 15 and Day 30 from the first infusion in
      Treatment Period 1. Follow-up will either be conducted in the inpatient setting or as a phone
      follow-up should the subject be discharged. Subjects will be observed during the index
      hospitalization and monitored for outcome and safety with vital signs (heart rate, blood
      pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation), physical examinations, electrocardiograms
      (ECGs), clinical laboratory testing (CBC, CMP, BNP, CRP, ESR, cytokine assay, viral load,
      troponin I, myoglobin, ferritin, procalcitonin, ABGs, and lipid panel), chest x-rays, and
      adverse events. A blood sample will be collected at the clinical site and sent to a central
      laboratory for proteomic assay testing. Transthoracic echocardiograms will be performed when
      indicated by clinical or laboratory evidence of cardiac involvement during the index
      hospitalization. Use of any concomitant medications to treat COVID-19 will be documented.

      Stopping rules on the subject-level and study-level have been defined to ensure subjects are
      not exposed to significant risk. Oversight of the trial will be provided by independent
      Clinical Event Committee (CEC), Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), and Medical Monitor.
