  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous
      (IV) infusion of ulinastatin compared to placebo with respect to time to recovery, disease
      severity, need for ventilator support, and mortality in patients with COVID 19.
