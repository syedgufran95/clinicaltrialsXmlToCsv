  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first case of a person infected with SARS-Cov-2 virus can be tracked back on November the
      17th, 2019, in China. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared
      COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. On April 13, COVID-19 is affecting 210 countries and
      territories worldwide, about 2 million positive cases have been officially declared along
      with 115.000 deaths. The real number of infected and deaths is scarily higher, considering
      that up to 65% people are asymptomatic and thus, not tested.

      The percentage of patients with COVID-19 needed for intensive care unit (ICU) varied from 5
      to 32% in Wuhan, China. It was up to 9% in Lombardy, Italy. According to available data from
      Lombardy, 99% of patients admitted to the ICU needed respiratory support (88% invasive
      ventilation, 11% non invasive ventilation).

      The aim of the present investigation is to test the hypothesis whether transcutaneous partial
      O2 and CO2 pressures may be reliable predictive factors for acute respiratory distress
      syndrome (ARDS) development in hospitalized clinically stable COVID-19 positive patients and
      to clarify the role of the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and its final product,
      angiotensin 2 (Ang II) in the pathogenesis of this systemic disease.

      We also aim to test the hypothesis that plasma concentration of Clara Cell protein (CC16) and
      surfactant protein D (SPD), which are a biomarkers of acute lung injury, are severely
      decreased in COVID-19 positive patients and the plasma concentration is related to the
      severity of lung injury.

    <description>Percutaneous O2 and CO2 partial pressures. A PeriFlux system 5000 (Perimed©, Järfälla, Sweden) will be used to monitor TcpO2 and TcpCO2 tensions by means of a PF 5040 unit and a dual TcpO2/CO2 E5280 electrode. The E5280 electrode, covered by a membrane permeable to oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) heats (44°C) the underlying tissue to maximize gas diffusion through the skin. .
Pulse Oximeter and hemodynamic parameters Pulse oximeter is a portable device largely used to measure real time finger oxygen saturation (SatO2) and heart rate Blood collection After the above said measurements, a venous blood simple will be realized. Plasma concentration of ACE2, Angiotensin II, Angiotensin 1-7, angiotensin 1-9, CC16, will be measured at the Erasme hospital (ELISA method).</description>
