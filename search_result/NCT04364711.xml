      Background Rapid European COVID-19 Emergency Research response (RECoVER), is a project
      involving 10 international partners that has been selected for funding by the European Union
      under the Horizon 2020 research framework responding to call topic SC1-PHE-CORONAVIRUS-2020:
      Advancing knowledge for the clinical and public health response to the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
      MERMAIDS 2.0 is the hospital care study within RECOVER.

      Rationale Detailed patient-oriented studies are needed to determine the spectrum of
      SARS-CoV-2 disease and the combined influences of age, comorbidities and pathogen
      co-infections on the development of severe disease, together with virological and
      immunological profiles. This research is key to understanding the pathophysiology and
      epidemiology of this new disease, as well as to identifying potential targets for therapeutic
      or preventive interventions.

      Objective To establish the prevalence, disease spectrum and severity, clinical features, risk
      factors, spread and outcomes of novel 2019 coronavirus infection (SARS-CoV-2) in Hospital
      Care.

      Study design Prospective observational cohort study in selected European countries.

      Study population

      Children and adults with 1) acute respiratory illness (ARI) presenting to hospital care
      during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic (including both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients) and 2)
      patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, but with atypical presentation (non-ARI) or with
      nosocomial acquisition. Sites can optionally participate in the following tiers:

      Tier 0 (Clinical data collection only) - Clinical data will be collected but no biological
      samples will be obtained for research purposes. Summary of the illness episode and outcome,
      including a selection of risk factors and comorbidities and medications.

      Tier 1 (Clinical data and biological sampling) - Clinical samples and data will be collected
      on enrolment day and then at scheduled time points.

      Tier 2 (Clinical data an extended biological sampling).

      Optional add-on study In a subset of sites and patients, COVID-19 positive patients will be
      followed post-discharge for 6 months to study clinical recovery and long-term sequelae Main
      study parameters/endpoints: Prevalence of COVID-19 among patients with acute respiratory
      illness. COVID-19 disease spectrum and host and pathogen risk factors for severity. Long-term
      sequelae of COVID-19 requiring hospital care. Proportion hospital-acquired COVID-19
      infections and characteristics of nosocomial transmission.

      Study Duration Scheduled 2 years and based on COVID-19 dynamics.

      Nature and extent of the burden associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness
      This study is observational in nature. There will be no direct benefit to research
      participants. The study may include biological sampling in addition to sampling required for
      medical management. The results of the tests done on these samples may not contribute to
      improving the participant's health. Minimal inconvenience and discomfort to the participant
      may arise from study visits and biological sampling.

        This is a descriptive study of the clinical syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2. Patients will
        only be considered for enrolment if appropriate local infection control and prevention
        measures are in place and can be maintained. In hospital, potential participants will be
        identified through hospital workers upon presentation at recruiting sites. The clinical
        research infrastructures of COMBACTE CLIN-NET will be used for site selection for an
        efficient establishment of a clinical network with broad European coverage providing access
        to a large patient population across all age groups and differing healthcare environments.
