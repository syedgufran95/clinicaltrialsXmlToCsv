    <textblock>
      During SARS-Cov2 infection with serious respiratory implication and high systemic
      inflammation level, intravenous ANAKINRA alone or associated with RUXOLITINIB for severe
      cases might reduce inappropriate systemic inflammatory response, improve breathing and
      decrease occurrence or duration of ARDS and associated mortality.

    <textblock>
      Two physiopathological phases exist during COVID-19 disease: The early phase is mainly
      induced by the virus itself. It is imperative not to decrease the immune host response during
      this phase by prohibiting the use of non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids
      at this stage and developing an anti-viral strategy. The late phase, around Day 7-9, depends
      only upon host response and is linked to an excessive inflammatory response with a major
      increase of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, MCP-1, GCSF indicative of IL-1b excess, as
      well as IP-10, MIP-1, indicative of IFNg signature, corresponding to a &quot;cytokine storm&quot;.
      Clinical and biological features during Still's disease (complicated in 10% of cases with
      hemophagocytosic lymphohistiocytosis inducing cytopenia, hepatic insufficiency, major
      hyperferritinemia and multi-organ failure) are close to those reported during COVID-19 and
      underline physiopathological similarities.

      Anakinra (KINERET) is an IL-1 pathway (IL-1ra) specific inhibitor that has been used for 15
      years, also largely blocking IL-18 production. Adult Still's disease is very effectively
      treated with anakinra. During sepsis with hyperferritinemia, IL-1ra demonstrated patient
      survival improvement. Ruxolitinib (JAKAVI) inhibits the downstream IFNg pathway targeting JAK
      kinase receptor. It has recently proved its efficiency in hemophagocytosic
      lymphohistiocytosis refractory forms associated with a multi-organ failure.
