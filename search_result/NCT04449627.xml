  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that admission to hospital during a coronavirus epidemic is associated
      with increased levels of anxiety, depression and panic disorder. During the SARS-CoV-2
      pandemic in North London the Royal Free Hospital admitted over 500 patients with Covid-19. As
      part of the standard of care, these patients are screened at 8 weeks post discharge for signs
      of anxiety and depression. The Feeling Good app is a NHS approved digital application which
      utilises applied relaxation, mindfulness based cognitive therapy and positive visualisation
      through audio tracks for the treatment of anxiety and depression.

      This is a naturalistic cohort study aimed to track the post illness psychological symptoms of
      those who have been admitted with Covid-19 to the Royal Free hospital up to 5-7 months after
      discharge. The study population is those who are exhibiting anxiety or depressive symptoms as
      measure by the PHQ-2 or TSQ questionnaires. All those with symptoms will be offered free
      access to a NHS approved app for anxiety and depression, and followed up for 3 months after
      recruitment to track changes to their symptoms.

  <detailed_description>

      It is important that the long-term wellbeing of patients who have been admitted with Covid-19
      during the pandemic is addressed. A newly published meta analysis (Rogers et al 2020) has
      looked at the neuropsychiatric consequences of all coronavirus epidemics, including Serious
      Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory (MERS) outbreaks, as well as
      the first emerging studies from SARS-CoV-2. These studies demonstrate that postillness
      neuropsychiatric complications including anxiety and depression can persist up to 36 months
      after the original illness. This is a naturalistic cohort trial with a digital intervention.
      The study population consists of those patients who were admitted with Covid-19, during the
      SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, who at 8 weeks after discharge were found to have symptoms relating to
      anxiety and depression. In this context Covid-19 refers to the disease caused by the virus
      (named SARS-CoV-2). The study population does not include those who required intensive care
      admission during their stay. Excluding usual community psychiatric services (for example
      improving access to psychological therapies) and some specialist intensive care follow up
      services, no interventions at the Royal Free have been set up to address the long-term
      psychological impacts of admission to hospital with COVID-19. The digital intervention is an
      app that consists of twelve audio tracks that combine applied relaxation, mindfulness,
      cognitive behaviour therapy and positive visualisation. It is a validated guided self-help
      tool for treatment of anxiety and depression in the NHS, and recommended by NHS digital.
      Participants are asked to listen to one or two tracks daily for the initial 14 days, and as
      they find beneficial thereafter. They are then followed up, at 2 and 12 weeks, with their
      anxiety and depression scales (the GAD-7 and PHQ-9). The trial is a single site study that
      will take place at the Royal Free, with discharged patients in the community

    <time_frame>Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Generalised anxiety disorder score (GAD-7) scale. Score 0-21, with a higher score associated with greater anxiety symptoms. Scores of 5, 10, and 15 represent cut-points for mild, moderate, and severe anxiety, respectively. GAD-7 score at baseline will be controlled for.</description>

    <measure>Depression as measured by the patient health questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is a screening tool for the identification of depressive disorders, which has been validated for use in primary care. Each of the nine items in the questionnaire is based on the DSM diagnostic criteria for clinical depression. The PHQ-9 is scored out of 27 according to severity, where score of 5-9 indicates mild depression, 10-14 moderate, 15-19 moderately severe, and 20 or above severe depression.</description>
