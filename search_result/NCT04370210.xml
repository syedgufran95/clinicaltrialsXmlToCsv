    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether sleep disturbances in children aged 7 to 12
      during COVID-19 containment are more prevalent in children who received routine psychiatric
      care before containment compared to children who don't have any psychiatric care.

      The coronavirus epidemic reached France in January 2020 and the WHO declared the COVID-19
      outbreak was a pandemic on 11 March 2020. In response to this pandemic the French government
      announced national containment starting on 17 March 2020. Some recent studies suggest that a
      containment duration of more than 10 days and an extension beyond the originally announced
      duration would increase the psychological impact of it.

      Sleep is a vital function that contributes to the proper neurophysiological and psychological
      development of human beings especially children. Sleep disorders can have a major impact on a
      child's behavior, mood, cognitive performance and metabolism. Sleep disorders are often
      associated with depression, anxiety and cognitive changes. Chronic sleep disorders are also
      risk factors for mental illness To our knowledge, no study targeting the quality of sleep in
      children who usually receive psychiatric care is underway or has been published. It is
      essential to ask what the quality of sleep in children with a psychiatric diagnosis who
      suddenly lose their bearings and their usual daily routine (school, therapeutic groups, day
      hospitals, etc.) after several weeks of containment.

      This study is designed to assess different parameters in the 2 groups of children (healthy
      volunteers and Child with follow-up in child psychiatry) :

        -  the sleep quality,

        -  the depression level,

        -  the anxiety level,

        -  if socio-demographic factors have an influence on sleep disorders,

        -  if there is a correlation between children's sleep quality, and anxiety level / sleep
           quality in their parents.

    <description>Sleep quality is assessed with the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC scale). For their parents, sleep quality and anxiety level are measured with a numerical scale between 0 and 10. For sleep quality, 0 correspond to a very poor quality and 10 to a very good quality. For anxiety level, 0 correspond to no anxiety and 10 to a severe anxiety. The score obtained for child is interpreted in function of their parents score.</description>
