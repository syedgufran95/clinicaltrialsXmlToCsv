  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The federal government of Malaysia implemented a nationwide Movement Control Order (MCO) to
      control the COVID-19 outbreak. The MCO, however, has been found to have a negative impact on
      people's mental wellbeing. Interventions that can improve mental health under restricted
      movement condition is urgently. The present study investigated the impact of a brief, online
      mindfulness-based intervention on mental health using two-arm randomized controlled trial
      design. A total of 161 participants self-reported their feeling, anxiety, psychological
      insecurity, and well-being at baseline (T1) and post-test (T2), while 61 of them answered the
      same set of measures and the fear of COVID-19 scale in a follow-up study two weeks later
      (T3).

    <description>We adapted and contextualized the original RAIN protocol to local pandemic-induced lockdown situation, with short journaling prompts that engage participants in self-reflection. Journaling is known to be a creative way to engage people in a therapeutic activity which promotes self-awareness (Utley &amp; Garza, 2011). Creating a visual narration of thoughts, feelings and experiences help individuals make internal experiences more tangible and manageable, especially during these uncertain times.</description>
