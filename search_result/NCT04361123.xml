  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to collect information about coronavirus exposures, symptoms,
      and health care visits due to the among Atrium Health clients and health care workers.
      Participation in this study will involve completing a daily questionnaire which covers
      participants coronavirus illness history or symptoms, health care seeking behaviors and
      treatments, contact with other sick people, and for health care workers, their use of
      personal protective equipment.

      Investigators will conduct a prospective, cohort study for SARS-CoV-2 infections among
      clients and health care workers of Atrium Health. Investigators will conduct real-time
      syndromic respiratory disease surveillance and, for SARS-CoV-2 infections, calculate baseline
      seroprevalence and seroconversion rates, hazard risks from close contacts, estimate efficacy
      of personal protective equipment, and assess sequelae incidence. Investigators will utilize
      the COVID-19 Therapeutic Learning System, an Oracle developed self-reporting data collection
      system that can be easily modified to address these specific questions. Over the course of
      the study, volunteers will report daily exposures, risk reduction behaviors, and symptoms
      through a secure app on their smartphone, tablet, or computer. In addition to daily syndromic
      surveillance, at baseline and once every month after that we will use a serologic IgM/G test
      kit to identify infections and reinfections in volunteers and send results to the Oracle
      developed database. The areas covered by this study are experiencing community spread of
      COVID-19 but are early enough in the epidemic to capture potentially a significant number of
      seroconversions over the 12 months of the study.
