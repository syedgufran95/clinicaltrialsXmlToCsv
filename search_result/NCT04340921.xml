  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is associated with complications including ARDS and myocardial injury, which informs
      prognosis and patient outcome. The laboratory plans to perform immunophenotyping of
      peripheral T-cells in patients with COVID-19 and complications (ARDS, ITU admission,
      myocardial injury) and map this against clinical patient outcomes. The aim is to determine if
      there is a specific T-cell immunophenotype associated with COVID-19 and/or complications,
      which can be used to inform prognosis and potential therapies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infection with the novel coronavirus COVID-19 is designated a pandemic by the World Health
      Organisation (WHO).COVID-19 infection can result in severe lung inflammation which, when
      present, dominates the clinical course for most patients. However, other organs may also be
      involved and the cardiovascular (CV) system appears to have complex interactions with
      COVID-19. Published reports suggest evidence of heart muscle damage in 20-40% of hospitalised
      cases presenting as cardiac chest pain, heart failure, abnormal heart rhythms and cardiac
      death.

      Many affected were previously well, but approximately half of those admitted to hospital
      COVID-19 have other medical problems, increasing in those requiring ITU admission or those
      that died. Patients with pre-existing CV conditions have some of the worst outcomes. Although
      pre-existing disorders reduce an individual's capacity to withstand severe illness, it is
      also likely that CV diseases may increase the risk of developing complicated COVID-19
      disease. Our hypothesis is that immunological abnormalities acquired as a consequence of
      pre-existing disorders is responsible for this.

      A question central to potential therapeutic options is the extent to which COVID-19 related
      myocardial injury results from viral replication (cytopathic), is immune mediated or is due
      to other mechanisms. Given that rapid onset cardiac injury can occur at 7-14 days after onset
      of COVID symptoms we propose to evaluate the contribution of adaptive T-cell mediated
      immunity in patients with and without myocardial injury. If successful, we may be able to
      identify treatments that suppress discrete components of the immune system to prevent
      myocardial damage without depressing protective immune function.
