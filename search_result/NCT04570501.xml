  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous (IV) infusion of
      Ang (1-7) compared to placebo with respect to time to recovery, disease severity, need for
      mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and mortality in
      patients with COVID 19.
