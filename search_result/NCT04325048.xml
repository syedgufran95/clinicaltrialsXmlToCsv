      Study on adult patients positive to COVID-19 virus. After signing informed consent and
      undergoing screening assessments, eligible patients will record few times a day several
      pre-defined sentences to the Cordio App installed in a smartphone/tablet.

      The app will upload the vocal data to the sponsor's servers for analysis. The patient will
      record at hospital admittance (COVID-19 positive) until patient defined as COVID-19 negative
      and free of relevant clinical symptoms.
