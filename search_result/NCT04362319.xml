  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We plan to perform an observational study to evaluate the prevalence of burnout, depression
      and medical errors in a designated exclusive Covid-19 patients hospital in Malaysia, during
      the Covid-19 pandemic. We also seek to assess the relationship between burnout and depression
      with medical errors. The population studied will be the anaesthesiology fraternity, who are
      at higher risk to the nature of their work at the frontlines of the pandemic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During this unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic crisis in the whole world, Malaysia is also
      affected, with more than 5000 patients infected in the whole country as of 20th April, 2020.
      Many anaesthesiology clinicians, who are at the frontlines of managing Covid-19 patients,
      face increased workload, in addition to psychological stress from managing these patients,
      with stress also coming from being exposed to the risk of cross infection. Hence, they are
      possibly at high risk of burnout and depression. In such a time of increased stress, we also
      seek to find out the prevalence of medical errors by anaesthetic clinicians during this
      pandemic, and whether the medical errors are associated with burnout. Factors associated with
      burnout, depression and medical errors will also be evaluated.
