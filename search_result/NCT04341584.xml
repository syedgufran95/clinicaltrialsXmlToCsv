  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the study is to determine the therapeutic effect and tolerance of
      Anakinra in patients with moderate, severe pneumonia or critical pneumonia associated with
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Anakinra (ANA) is a recombinant human decoy IL-1Ra and
      therefore blocks IL-1α and IL-1β. The study has a cohort multiple Randomized Controlled
      Trials (cmRCT) design. Randomization will occur prior to offering Anakinra administration to
      patients enrolled in the COVIMUNO-19 cohort. Anakinra will be administered to consenting
      adult patients hospitalized with CORVID-19 either diagnosed with moderate or severe pneumonia
      requiring no mechanical ventilation or critical pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation.
      Patients who will chose not to receive Anakinra will receive standard of cares. Outcomes of
      Anakinra -treated patients will be compared with outcomes of standard of care treated
      patients as well as outcomes of patients treated with other immune modulators.

    <description>Cumulative incidence of successful tracheal extubation (defined as duration extubation &gt; 48h) at day 14 if patients have been intubated before day 14 ; or removal of NIV or high flow (for &gt; 48h) if they were included under oxygen by NIV or High flow (score 6) and remained without intubation.
