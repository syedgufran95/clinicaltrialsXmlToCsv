  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This original study will assess the impact of the coronavirus health crisis on the management
      of patients undergoing medical treatment for cancer, in particularly on the modification of
      the hospital organization. It will also provide a record of the progress of patients who will
      have been treated during the epidemic period and infected by the virus.

      We will also assess the psychological impact of the pandemic in patients but also in
      caregivers
