  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial with adaptive design assessing the
      efficacy of setting the ventilator based on measurements of respiratory mechanics
      (recruitability and effort) to reduce Day 60 mortality in patients with acute respiratory
      distress syndrome (ARDS)

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major public health problem affecting
      approximately 10% of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) and 23% of all patients on a
      breathing machine (mechanical ventilator). The short-term mortality of patients with ARDS is
      approximately 40% and better ventilation of these patients has the greatest potential to
      improve outcomes.

      The lungs in patients with ARDS are severely inflamed which reduces lung volume and their
      ability to stretch, making ventilation difficult and dangerous. However, mechanical
      ventilation is the mainstay of supportive therapy. Although it is life-saving, it can also
      can generate secondary injury and inflammation, called ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).
      The investigators know that inadequate mechanical ventilation worsens outcomes but are
      uncertain of the optimal way to manage ventilators at the bedside.

      Furthermore, ARDS is challenging because there is no treatment for the alveolar-capillary
      leak characterizing this syndrome; aside from treating the underlying cause, the only
      supportive therapy is mechanical ventilation. This is specially the case for COVID-19 induced
      ARDS. Despite best practices, over-distension of the lung or inappropriate positive end
      expiratory pressure (PEEP) is common. Finally, once spontaneous breathing has resumed and is
      assisted by the ventilator, an additional phenomenon occurs, called patient self-inflicted
      lung injury. The drive for breathing in many patients is stimulated by lung inflammation, and
      strong breathing efforts can generate high distending pressures, causing lung (and systemic)
      inflammation and organ damage.

      Recent advances in our understanding of bedside physiology (airway closure, recruitability,
      lung distension, respiratory drive) can now be applied for an individual titration of
      mechanical ventilation.

    <description>Different maneuvers based on respiratory mechanics will be assessed at the bedside and will be used to individualize ventilator parameters. Recruitability will be assessed with a one breath decremental PEEP maneuver, and search for airway closure with a low-flow pressure volume or pressure-time curve. If the patient has airway closure, the minimal PEEP will be set at the airway opening pressure to avoid closure. If the patient is considered recruitable, the goal is to set PEEP at or above 15cmH20 to maximize alveolar recruitment, until the plateau pressure reaches the safety limit. Volume control ventilation at 6ml·kg-1 will be used.
Once spontaneous breathing has started, the occlusion pressure (P0.1) will be maintained within targets.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the control arm will receive standard care. The PEEP is adjusted for oxygenation based on a PEEP-FiO2 table, either the low PEEP-FiO2 or the high PEEP-FiO2 table. Volume targeted ventilation with initial VT 6 mL·kg-1 and Plateau pressure at 30 cmH2O or below, targeting PaO2 60-80 or SpO2 90-95%, adjusted as per the protocol. Pressure-support ventilation is at physician's discretion, but recommended when FiO2 &lt;60%, and is titrated VT 6-8 mL·kg-1.</description>
