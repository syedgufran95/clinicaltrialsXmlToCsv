  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed tremendous stress on the global
      economy since its outbreak in December 2019. Currently, with nearly 1.3 million confirmed
      cases, there is still no effective way to contain the disease. The transmission of COVID-19
      occurs via direct (prolonged close interaction, within 2 meters for more than 30 minutes) and
      indirect (fomites) contacts. Locally, the risk of COVID-19 infection in household contacts of
      confirmed cases is about 4%. These at-risk individuals are identified through contact tracing
      and infectious may be preventable using post-exposure-prophylaxis (PEP). However, there has
      yet to be a single effective, safe, and affordable pharmacological agent with such
      capabilities. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a cheap anti-malarial and immunomodulatory agent
      which may potentially be used as PEP against COVID-19. HCQ is capable of blocking the
      invasion and intracellular replication of the virus. Existing studies have reported efficacy
      of HCQ in treating COVID-19, with reduced time to clinical recovery and few reports of
      patients suffering from significant side effects. However, existing studies are largely
      limited by their small sample sizes. Furthermore, there has yet to be a published trial on
      HCQ's role in PEP. This cluster randomized trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      oral HCQ PEP, taken over for 5 days, in reducing the number of infected household contacts of
      confirmed COVID-19 patients under home quarantine. Comparison will be made between HCQ PEP
      (treatment group) and no treatment (control group). Subjects will be followed up over a
      course of 28 days, with daily symptom monitoring conducted over phone calls. Positive
      outcomes from this study will provide a means for us to battle the COVID-19 pandemic.

    The number of patients with COVID-19 in Singapore was coming down for the community and the
    concerns about the potential side effects particularly when the baseline ECG and serum
    electrolytes was not proposed.
