    <textblock>
      The present study aims to assess the determinants of health-related quality of life and
      patient-centered long-term outcomes among survivors of hospitalization for Covid-19 in
      Brazil. The investigators will conduct a multicenter prospective cohort study nested in
      randomized clinical trials (coalition Covid-19 Brazil initiative) originally designed to
      assess the effects of specific Covid-19 treatments. Adult survivors of hospitalization due to
      proven or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection will be followed up for a period of one year by
      means of structured telephone interviews. The primary outcome is one-year health-related
      quality of life assessed by the EQ-5D-3L. Secondary outcomes include all-cause mortality,
      rehospitalizations, return to work or study, physical functional status assessed by the
      Lawton &amp; Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, dyspnea assessed by the
      modified medical research council dyspnea scale, need of long-term ventilatory support,
      symptoms of anxiety and depression assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and
      symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-revised. Four
      sets of variables (1-demographic characteristics, 2-pre-morbid state of health,
      3-characteristics of acute illness, and 4- specific Covid-19 treatments received) will be
      assessed as potential risk factors for health-related quality of life and secondary outcomes.
