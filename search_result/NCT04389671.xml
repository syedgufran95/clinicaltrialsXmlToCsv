      This is a multicenter, single-treatment study. Subjects will consist of adults with COVID-19
      associated acute lung injury who are being cared for in a critical care environment.

      Lucinactant is a synthetic surfactant that was approved for the prevention of respiratory
      distress syndrome (RDS) in premature infants. It has been studied in over 2000 children and
      adults. Preliminary data from animal and adult human studies indicate that lucinactant may be
      able to benefit those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the context of
      COVID-19 infection, improving oxygenation and lung compliance. When given to intubated
      patients, lucinactant could potentially decrease the duration of ventilation.

      Lucinactant has an extensive safety profile in different patient populations for different
      indications.

      It is hypothesized that lucinactant may improve the respiratory status of patients suffering
      from COVID-19.
