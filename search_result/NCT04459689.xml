  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need to
      understand the impact of infection on immunodeficient individuals. Whilst co-morbidities
      (such as diabetes, cancer, arterial hypertension, heart disease...) have been documented in
      people infected with SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no information on the consequences and
      outcomes for individuals with primary immunodeficiencies (PID).

      Following the 1st phase of the survey (launched by Isabelle Meyts (ESID), Nizar Mahlaoui
      (CEREDIH &amp; IPOPI) and Kate Sullivan with Stuart Tangye (IUIS), that gave an idea of the
      number of affected PID patients and the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and directly focusing on
      obtaining this top level of information), we are launching the 2nd phase: &quot;COPID19&quot;.

      COPID19 survey is a secured online GDPR compliant platform based in Paris (Imagine
      Institute). It has been approved by the Paris-Necker-Enfants malades IRB and Ethics
      Committee. However, this retrospective survey is designed for global distribution. Data can
      be entered by a health care professional (mostly clinicians) through a personal login and
      password.

      Each documenting person will have access to his/her own patients' data. COPID19 require a
      greater level of information than the 1st phase. The eCRF will be open to evolutions
      depending on progresses in our knowledge of this pandemic.
