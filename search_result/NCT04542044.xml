  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the strategy of investigators for outpatients
      SARS-CoV-2 moderate pneumonia management in terms of efficacy and patient safety. The
      investigators ultimate goal is to validate first wave management strategy in order to support
      the investigators future approach in the event of a second wave, and spare the hospital
      resources by safely keeping at home as many patients as possible.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators focused on participants consulting in the emergency department at the HUG
      who remained in an outpatient setting, with pneumonia and moderate illness, defined by
      individuals who have evidence of lower respiratory disease by clinical assessment or imaging
      and a saturation of oxygen (SaO2) &gt;93% on room air and no other hospitalization criteria
      (CURB 65 score below 2points).

      For patients' follow-up, the investigators have created an aftercare ambulatory unit, open
      5/7 days. The investigators were able to conduct 64 consultations between April 2 and May 5,
      2020. Every participant had suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary tract infection.

      The follow-up data was entered into DPI (patient's medical record at HUG) on a specific
      consultation form. Patients followed in the investigators consultation were contacted between
      30 and 60 days after diagnosis by the Covicare team. The Covicare team is call-center
      composed of medical students and primary care physicians who remotely followed patients with
      COVID-19 by calling them by phone or telemedicine every day or every other day depending on
      patients' needs and health status. The investigators will export data from RedCap concerning
      post-hospitalization, satisfaction survey on our care and oral consent for use of data (ARGOS
      study CCER number 2020-01273).
