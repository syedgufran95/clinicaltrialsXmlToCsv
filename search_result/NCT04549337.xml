  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This current protocol encompasses an investigator-blinded randomized exercise intervention in
      10 COVID-19 survivors that have been discharged from hospital. The subjects will be
      randomized to perform three different exercise training protocols in a random order.

      The aim is to clarify the feasibility and safety of three training protocols in COVID-19
      survivors. The hypothesis is that patients surviving COVID-19 will be able to comply to all
      training protocols.

    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized crossover trial testing the feasibility and safety of three
      different training protocols in 10 COVID-19 survivors that have been discharged from
      hospital. The subjects will be randomized to perform three different exercise training
      protocols in a random order.

      The aim is to clarify the feasibility and safety of three training protocols in COVID-19
      survivors. The hypothesis is that patients surviving COVID-19 will be able to comply to all
      training protocols.

      The study consists of 4 visits with 1 baseline session (a medical screening and fitness test)
      and 3 different training sessions. Each training is separated by 1-week washout, to account
      for potential confounding by leisure activity performed just before the training, patients
      will be wearing activity watches (Polar).

      Feasibility and safety evaluation will be based on 1) how tolerable and enjoyable the
      training was based on a subjective questionnaire (Likert Scale) 2) compliance to the
      prescribed exercise protocol with regard to duration and intensity and 3) experienced side
      effects.

    <masking>Double (Participant, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Participants are randomly allocated following successful completion of the baseline measurements. A researcher, that is not involved in testing or training procedures, generates a computer-generated block randomization schedule with balanced permutations. To ascertain allocation concealment, the block sizes will not be disclosed. The schedule is forwarded to a research assistant, who is not involved in any study procedures and stored on a password protected computer. Following the baseline measurements, the participants are given consecutive numbers. These are forwarded to the research assistant, who returns the corresponding allocation sequence to the study coordinator. The participants are blinded for treatment allocation until treatment assignment. However, following the initial two treatments blinding of the participants is no longer possible. All study personal involved with data collection will be blinded during baseline testing.</masking_description>

    <description>the 10-point Likert scale, which evaluates enjoyment and perceived tolerance of each training protocol at the end of each training session using a 10-point Likert scale, which is one of the most fundamental and frequently used psychometric tools in social science research. Patients have to indicate the degree to which they agreed with the following statement before training: &quot;How motivated are you for today's training?&quot; following two statements after the training: &quot;How enjoyable have today´s training session been?&quot; and &quot;How tolerant has today´s training been?&quot; A higher number describes better agreement.</description>

    <description>An exercise training protocol with a duration of 38 minutes consisting of a 10 minutes warm up with a heart rate of 60-70% of HRmax followed by 4 intervals of 4 minutes at an intensity that will induce at least 85% of HRmax (we will start with 75% of watt max).
Each interval is separated by 3-minute active pauses, biking at 50-70% of HRmax. Following this a 3-minute cooldown (at warm up intensity) will be performed.</description>

Each interval consists of 5 minutes of 5 repeated 30-20-10 intervals, consisting of 30 seconds at easy pace, 20 seconds at medium pace and 10 seconds at all-out. Following this a 7-minute cooldown (at warm up intensity) will be performed.</description>

    <description>Feasibility and safety of 3 different training protocols will be tested. Therefore the intervention is three different exercise protocols (4X4, 6X1, and 10-20-30). The exercise workload is set according to the patients HRmax or wattmax from a VO2max test at the baseline testing. All training protocols have a duration of 38 minutes and start with a 10-minute warm up and a 3-7-minute cool-down period. The intervals in the training protocols are interspersed with a 3-minute active rest. Therefore the three exercise protocols are matched on duration, and they all fall within the category of high-intensity-interval training.
The accumulated time spend with a heart rate &gt;85% of HR max will be evaluated to determine the intensity.</description>
