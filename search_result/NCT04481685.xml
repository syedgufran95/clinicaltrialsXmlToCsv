  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 morbidity and mortality has been associated with Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and
      Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).

      ATI-450 is an oral small molecule MAPKAPK2 (MK2) inhibitor that potently inhibits multiple
      inflammatory cytokines.

      The investigator hypothesizes that MK2 pathway blockade during active COVID-19 infection in
      hospitalized participants will result in improvement in respiratory-failure free survival.
