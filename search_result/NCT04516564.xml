  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1, single-center, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and
      immunogenicity of AK119, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the CD73. The study will
      consist of 4 cohorts of healthy subjects. Eight subjects will be enrolled per cohort,
      randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive a single dose of either the active drug AK119 (N=6) or
      matching placebo (N=2). Approximately 32 subjects (24 receiving active drug and 8 receiving
      placebo) will participate in this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must meet ALL the following inclusion criteria (as applicable) to be eligible for
        participation in this study:

          -  Adults between 18 and 55 years of age, inclusive, at screening.

          -  Must have a calculated body mass index (BMI, weight [kg]/height [m2]) within 18.0 to
             30.0 kg/m2 (inclusive) at screening, and a total body weight ≥50 kg for men or ≥45 kg
             for women at screening and Day -1 before randomization.

          -  Must, in the opinion of the Investigator, be in good general health based upon medical
             history, physical examination (including vital signs), and 12-lead ECG; and clinical
             laboratory tests (up to 1 repeat permitted) must fall within the clinical laboratory&quot;s
             reference normal ranges.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who meet ANY of the following exclusion criteria will not be enrolled in this
        study

          -  Have a history of latent or active granulomatous infection, including histoplasmosis,
             candidiasis, or coccidioidomycosis prior to screening, or a history of any other
             infectious disease within 4 weeks prior to screening that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, affects the subject&quot;s ability to participate in the study.

          -  Have a history of multiple drug allergies or a known allergy or hypersensitivity to
             any biologic therapy at screening that is important in the opinion of the
             Investigator.

          -  Have a known allergy or reaction to any component of the AK119 formulation.

          -  Have any known malignancy or have a history of malignancy within the previous 5 years.

          -  Have a 12-lead ECG demonstrating QTcF interval &gt; 450 msec for male subjects and &gt;470
             msec for female subjects at screening and Day -1 from average of 3 ECGs obtained after
             5 minutes of supine rest.

          -  Blood pressure (BP) &gt;150 mmHg (systolic) or &gt; 95 mmHg (diastolic) at screening and Day
             -1, following at least 5 minutes of supine rest.

          -  Have had a live vaccination within 12 weeks prior to the study dosing or intend to
             have a live vaccination during the course of the study or have participated in a
             vaccine clinical study within 12 weeks prior to the study dosing.
