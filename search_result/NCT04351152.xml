  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess whether the use of lenzilumab in addition to
      current standard of care can alleviate the immune-mediated cytokine release syndrome (CRS)
      and reduce the time to recovery in hospitalized subjects with severe or critical COVID-19
      pneumonia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In COVID-19, high levels of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and
      inflammatory myeloid cells correlate with disease severity, cytokine storm, and respiratory
      failure. This phase 3 randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical
      trial will evaluate the impact of lenzilumab (anti-human GM-CSF monoclonal antibody) on time
      to recovery in hospitalized patients with severe or critical COVID-19 pneumonia.

      Approximately 300 patients will be randomized to receive lenzilumab + SOC vs. SOC in a 1:1
      ratio. A pre-specified interim futility analysis is planned for the DSMB.
