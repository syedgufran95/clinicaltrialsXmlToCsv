  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pragmatic controlled clinical trial taking place in the first phase of COVID-19
      lockdown re-opening in Spain. Patients of 52 chiropractic clinics were invited to participate
      in a pseudo-random order (one out of every three contacted patients) as they were contacted
      to either schedule an appointment with their current chiropractor or not, depending on the
      clinic's and the patient's availability. Patients would receive chiropractic in-person care
      (one or more than one visits) or no care at all, for a two-week period. According to the care
      received, they were assigned to one of three groups (receiving no care, receiving care once,
      and more than once). Participants filled an online questionnaire with self-reported
      outcome-measures at the beginning of the two week period. A follow-up questionnaire was
      completed 14 days after.
