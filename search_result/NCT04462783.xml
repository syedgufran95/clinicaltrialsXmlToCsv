  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This feasibility study is being conducted to understand how discharged emergency department
      patients who were tested for the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) engage with a symptom-tracking
      web application. Study participants that are enrolled in the study will be asked to enter
      daily information about their health into the CovidX web application (app.). In addition,
      patients will answer questions regarding anxiety levels, use a pulse oximeter to record
      information (if you own one or are given one).

      The investigators predict that participants will be able to engage with the CovidX web
      application over several days to weeks for the purposes of symptom tracking, and may have
      decreased anxiety over the study period.

    <description>The PROMIS Emotional Distress-Anxiety-Short Form 4a is a 4-item scale that assesses fear, anxiety, worry, and uneasiness. It uses a 5-point Likert scale (1 = never to 5 = always). Raw scores range from 4-20 with lower scores representing less endorsement of anxiety.</description>
