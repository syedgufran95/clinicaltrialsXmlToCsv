    <textblock>
      This is an observational study, meaning that no interventions is tested, to determine
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 in different clinical sites in Brazil in
      several age groups. The study aims to assess baseline number of infected participants and
      perform a follow-up along two years to determine the new cases occurring among participants
      during the period. All participants will collect blood samples to get more details on the
      immune response.

      This is an observational longitudinal study to assess incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in
      Brazil. The study sample is stratified in nine age groups according decades of life, equally
      distributed in both sexes, with an expected incidence of 10%, at least, during the study
      period of 24 months. For the first age groups, (0-9, 10-19 and 20-29 years), sample was
      calculated with the minimum expected incidence of COVID-19 among infected, regardless
      severity, is 10%. For the latest age groups (30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79 and 80+), the
      sample was calculated with the expected minimum incidence of hospitalization due to COVID-19
      according to estimates per age group reported by Verity R et al.
      https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30243-7 After the consent procedure, all participants
      will have a short interview, a IgG/IgM SARS-CoV-2 rapid test and a blood withdrawal to obtain
      serum for neutralizing antibodies. These procedures will be repeated every four weeks until
      the end of the study. Individuals with symptoms compatible will be followed-up to confirm
      COVID-19 diagnosis as well as to assess severity, need for hospitalization and assisted
      ventilation, sequels, and eventual reinfection. Levels of neutralizing antibodies and other
      immune markers will be prospectively assessed in all infected participants, either
      asymptomatic and symptomatic.

        The sample size will be equally distributed in ten different cities of Brazil. Then, each
        site will have same representation of each age group. Participants can be selected from
        other ongoing community-based studies conducted in the site and from community in general.
        Balance of participant according to sex is recommended to the sites in all age group.
