             methodology, or, with presumptive diagnosis of COVID-19 (other respiratory causes
             ruled out and COVID-19 test pending);

          -  Hospitalized with COVID-19-induced pneumonia;

          -  Elevated CRP or ferritin levels;

          -  Body weight ≥ 40kg.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             metabolites of similar chemical classes as canakinumab;

          -  On the day of canakinumab treatment initiation; treatment with biologic
             immunomodulators or immunosuppressant drugs, including but not limited to TNF
             inhibitors and anti-IL-17 agents. Immunomodulators (topical or inhaled) for asthma and
             atopic dermatitis are permitted as are systemic low-dose corticosteroids (e.g. ≤10 mg
             prednisone per day);

          -  Use of tocilizumab within 3 weeks prior to dosing with canakinumab;

          -  Suspected or known active bacterial, fungal, or parasitic infection (besides
             COVID-19);

          -  Patients with significant neutropenia (ANC &lt;1000/mm3);

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 5 half-lives or 30 days (whichever is
