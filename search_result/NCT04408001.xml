  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is a pathology linked to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a new virus of the coronaviridae
      family that emerged in China in December 2019 before rapidly becoming a pandemic according to
      the WHO on March 11, 2020. The epidemic affected France from February 2020. On February 24, a
      patient hospitalized at Percy hospital was the cause of a major nosocomial epidemic,
      potentially responsible for more than 250 symptomatic people in the hospital as of April 6.
      The outbreak was identified by Percy hospital management on March 16, and barrier measures
      were immediately put in place. From March 20, a mixed investigation unit set up a chain of
      nasopharyngeal swabs for Percy hospital staff.

      A COVID-19 case reporting unit was set up at Percy hospital in response to the identification
      of the outbreak within the hospital. This unit carried out rapid identification and regular
      follow-up until the return to work of the staff. Thus all symptomatic patients are identified
      and the COVID-19 case census cell will follow all Percy hospital staff, including volunteers
      recruited to deal with the epidemic, throughout the duration of the epidemic. This
      population, captive by nature, will be one of the few described in the world during this
      epidemic.

      Current data on short-, medium- and long-term immunity induced by COVID-19 infection are
      fragmentary, as is the existence of a large asymptomatic population, making it difficult to
      cut the chains of transmission in the absence of an effective diagnostic tool.

      Another important issue is the quality of immunity induced by the infection, as it conditions
      the future of the pandemic, which could become endemic and recurrent if immunity were not
      sterilizing. As yet unpublished data in primates show that in the primate model re-infection
      is not possible in the short term, while patients cured from the Wuhan epidemic seem to be
      detected again positive for virus shedding.

      The objective of this study is to characterize the immunity (systemic and local) induced by
      SARS-Cov-2 infection among Percy hospital staff who are at high risk of contamination even in
      a period of confinement.
