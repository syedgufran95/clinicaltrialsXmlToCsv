  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The actual worldwide context (disease outbreak, confinements instaured in many countries) is
      a stressful factor for many people. It can have consequences on mental health : separation
      from loved ones, loss of freedom, uncertainty about infection status, boredom. Patients with
      mental disorders are especially vulnerable.

      On march 17th, the french government ordonned a national confinement to slow the progression
      of the COVID-19 outbreak, for 15 days at first then renewed several times. This situation has
      led to a reorganization of care as requested on March 22nd, 2020 in the recommendations
      applicable to the organization of care in psychiatric services : priority to telephone
      contacts and teleconsultation by multiplying contacts and assessments.

      By the time the reorganization of care became operational, the most vulnerable patients may
      have experienced a decompensation of their disease.

      It is important to know if the COVID-19 outbreak combined with the confinement increased the
      number of unvoluntary commitment the month after the announce of the confinement.

      This could help us understand which patients are more vulnerable is this context, and improve
      our organization (ambulatory and hospitalization care) if this situation occurs again.

      The main objective is to notice if we can observe a increase in the number of unvonluntary
      commitment the month after the announce of the confinement in the psychiatric hospital La
      Colombière, CHU Montpellier, France.

      Secondary objectives :

        -  Describe the causes of unvonluntary commitment, and the principal psychiatric diagnostic
           of the patients

        -  Assess the lengh of the hospitalization

        -  Assess the number of patients hospitalized without psychiatric antecedent

        -  Assess the number of treatment interruptions in the recent history before
           hospitalization

        -  Asses the number of patients living alone

        -  Asses the number of patients using drugs

      It is expected to highlight :

        -  An increase of the number of unvontuntary commitment

        -  If one or several mental disorders were more at risk of requiring an unvonluntary
           commitment

        -  An increased lengh of hospitalization

        -  An increased number of unvonluntary commitment of patients without psychiatric
           antecedent

        -  An increased number of treatment interruptions

        -  A link between hospitalization and living alone

        -  A link between hospitalization and using drugs

      The medical file of all the patients unvonlutary commited from march 12th to April 09th 2020
      are screened, and compared to the patients unvonlutary commited during the same period in
      2019.

      The caracteristics of interest are their age and sex, if the patient lives alone, the matter
      of hospitalization, its lengh, their primary psychiatric diagnostic, the use of toxics at the
      moment of the hospitalization and if this psychiatric decompensation happens in a context of
      treatment interruption.
