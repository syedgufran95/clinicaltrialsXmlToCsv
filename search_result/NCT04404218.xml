  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Açaí trial will be testing if the açaí berry extract, a safe natural product with
      anti-inflammatory properties, can be used as a treatment option in adult patients with
      COVID-19 in the community.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2). The virus
      origins have been studied and evidence so far suggests it originates in bats, with spread to
      humans likely mediated by an intermediate mammalian. Bats have a dampened Nod-like receptor
      family, pyrin-containing 3 (NLRP3)-mediated inflammation. Dampening NLRP3-mediated
      inflammation has been associated with the asymptotic viral status, therefore it is plausible
      that the pathogenic inflammatory response of SARS-CoV-2 might be associated with activation
      of NLRP3 inflammasome. Data show that the natural extract of Açaí Palm Berry (Euterpe
      oleracea Mart.) is a potent inhibitor of NLRP3. This is a safe, inexpensive, and readily
      available natural health supplement which could be a rapid response treatment intervention
      for patients with COVID-19.

      Our primary objective is to establish whether açai palm berry extract (Euterpe oleracea),
      given to community-dwelling adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19, compared to placebo,
      improves outcomes over 30 days on the 7-point ordinal scale described by Cao et al, and which
      is being used widely in COVID-19 trials with the aim of harmonizing endpoints. This study
      will be a prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicentre clinical
      trial of Açaí Palm Berry extract in adult patients tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 in the last
      7 days and that are currently being treated in the outpatient setting. The intervention group
      will receive 3 capsules of 520mg (one capsule every eight hours) of Acai Palm Berry extract
      (Nature's Way, NPN80038874) for 30 days. The non-intervention group will receive placebo
      pills, on top of standard clinical care. Our main endpoint will be the 7-point ordinal scale.

      This project has the benefit of offering a safe and widely used natural extract as a
      potential treatment strategy to decrease inflammation and improve disease outcomes in
      patients with COVID-19. With no vaccine currently available, the search for effective
      treatments is a timely approach. The potential impact of such a therapeutic agent, if
      effective, can be quite vast given that it can be readily used by anyone and, most
      importantly, is affordable in many countries.

    <description>Açaí palm berry extract is a powerful antioxidant with no known side-effects and is widely consumed in Brazil. Açaí palm berry chemical composition has been established and includes several antioxidants - gallic acid, catechin, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, epicatechin, orientin, cyanidin-3-0-glucoside, luteolin and apigenin. Orientin is the most concentrated compound (7,96mg/g) and this compound is able to modulate the NLRP3 inflammasome.</description>

    <description>This study will be double-blinded and placebo-controlled. To ensure double-blinding, placebo and active compound capsules will be over-encapsulated with DBCAPS® capsules, which were developed with a tamper-evident design to address the clinical trial challenges of testing without bias. These capsules are made of gelatin and have no interaction with bioavailability.</description>
