  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blinded, randomized control trial to assess the efficacy and safety of
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma in two groups, RT PCR-positive and asymptomatic or mildly
      symptomatic at baseline (group B) and PCR-negative at baseline (group C). Both groups will be
      randomized 1:1 to receive either convalescent plasma qualitatively positive for SARS-CoV-2
      antibody (anti-SARS-CoV-2 plasma) or control (albumin 5%).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are no approved therapies for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), also known as severe
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Exposure to viruses results in an
      adaptive immune response that commonly include antibodies with neutralization activity.
      Plasma from subjects who have recovered from viral infections has been used to both prevent
      or treat disease. Notable examples of the successful use of convalescent plasma (CP) include
      influenza, measles, Argentine hemorrhagic fever, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS),
      Ebola and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In recent work in China, an open label
      safety trial of CP in patients with COVID-19 suggested a substantive benefit.
