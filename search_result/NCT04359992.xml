  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 outbreak has led to a significant increase in the number of patients admitted to
      intensive care for respiratory distress. Early data indicate a particularly high risk of
      thrombotic risk to viral lung disease, particularly in the most severe patients, with a
      particularly high incidence of pulmonary embolism. Catheter thrombosis and extra-renal
      purification filters are also abnormally common. These thrombotic complications could
      contribute to the mortality observed in this pathology. The introduction of early curative
      anticoagulation in the most severe patients has just been proposed by the perioperative
      hemostasis interest group

      Biologically, a significant proportion of patients hospitalized in intensive care have a
      marked biological inflammatory syndrome, associated with signs of activation of clotting (a
      frank increase in D-dimers). The presence of circulating anticoagulants is common.
      Interestingly, thrombocytosis, normally observed in such inflammatory syndromes, is absent.

      In this context, it seems legitimate to explore these patients from a hemostasis perspective
      to identify the factors that cause this thrombotic over-risk, in order to minimize the
      occurrence of these complications.
