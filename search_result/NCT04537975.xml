    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A patient, or legal authorized representative (LAR), has provided informed consent and
             a written informed consent form.

          -  Positive COVID-19 test.

          -  Must be receiving medical care in an intensive care nursing situation.

          -  Respiratory failure due to COVID-19 disease requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.
             This care may include but is not required to include the use of dexamethasone.

          -  Within 18 hours of tracheal intubation to support invasive mechanical ventilation. A
             goal of this study is that T0 will occur within 24 hours of tracheal intubation to
             support invasive mechanical ventilation.

          -  Age 18 to 80 years.

          -  Males and females (females of childbearing potential who are not pregnant confirmed by
             a negative serum pregnancy test) and not lactating if recently post-partum).

          -  Intent to deliver full supportive care through aggressive management utilizing all
             available therapies for a minimum of 96 hours.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cardiovascular instability that precludes initiation of hemofiltration.

          -  Irreversible brain damage based on available historical and clinical information.

          -  Presence of any solid organ transplant at any time.

          -  Patients with stem cell transplant in the previous 100 days or who have not engrafted.

          -  Acute or chronic use of circulatory support device such as extracorporeal membrane
             oxygenation (ECMO), left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), right ventricular assist
             devices (RVADs), biventricular assist devices (BIVADs).

          -  Metastatic malignancy which is actively being treated or may be treated with
             chemotherapy or radiation during the subsequent three-month period after study
             treatment.

          -  Chronic immunosuppression defined as use of any immunosuppressant medications
             (cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, rituximab, mycophenolate,
             cyclosporine); prednisone use is excepted.

          -  Patient is moribund or chronically debilitated for whom full supportive care is not
             indicated.

          -  Concurrent enrollment in another interventional clinical trial except trials of
             COVID-19 convalescent plasma, anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV2
             monoclonal antibodies, or RemdesivirTM. Patients enrolled in observational studies
             (without the use of an investigative device or drug), are allowed to participate. Any
             communication between the Principal Investigator (PI) of this Protocol and the PI of
             any other clinical study will include the Medical Director of the Sponsor; all such
             correspondence will be documented.
