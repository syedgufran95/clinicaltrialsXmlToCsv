  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mortality rates caused by SARS CoV-2 differ between countries and this difference might be
      explained by several reasons. Childhood vaccination rate is thought to be one of them.
      Therefore present study aimed to examine the possible relationship between DTaP (diphtheria,
      tetanus, pertussis) and measles vaccination rates of Organization for Economic Co-operation
      and Development (OECD) countries and case fatality rate (CFR) caused by SARS CoV-2.

      The mortality rates caused by SARS CoV-2 differ between countries and this difference might
      be explained by several reasons. Childhood vaccination rate is thought to be one of them.
      Therefore present study aimed to examine the possible relationship between DTaP (diphtheria,
      tetanus, pertussis) and measles vaccination rates of Organization for Economic Co-operation
      and Development (OECD) countries and case fatality rate (CFR) caused by SARS CoV-2.A total of
      32 OECD countries, of northern hemisphere, have been included in this study. Statistical
      analysis performed according to the CFR data of these countries based on SARS CoV-2. The CFR
      data calculated according to the total mortality count of a specific country for the 3-month
      period down from the date when first SARS CoV-2 case was observed.
