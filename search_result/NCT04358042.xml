  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the possible risks and complications of a comorbidity between psychiatric disorder and
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it seems particularly important to specify the impact of
      the COVID-19 pandemic in patients with psychiatric disorders and suspected of infection,
      hospitalized in a specific unit, at the psychiatric, somatic and pharmacological level.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19's possible impact on psychiatric disorders has been little studied. However,
      patients with psychiatric disorders may be at higher risk of COVID-19 contamination, may
      experience delayed treatment when infected, may have a poor prognosis in terms of
      complications and success of treatment for COVID-19 but also for the underlying psychiatric
      disorder which could be exacerbated, and finally their psychotropic pharmacological treatment
      could be impacted by the inflammatory state linked to COVID-19.

      The present study is an observatory of patients with psychiatric disorders and suspected to
      be infected by the COVID-19, hospitalized in a specific unit dedicated to the treatment of
      this comorbidity in the University Hospital of Nantes (France). The primary objective is to
      investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the level of acute traumatic stress
      response. Secondary objectives include: (i) a description of the sample included; (ii) an
      assessment of the clinical evolution of these patients 4-6 weeks after admission; (iii) to
      investigate the links between the levels of stress, peritraumatic distress, and traumatic
      stress (whether it is acute or has evolved into a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD));
      (iv) to investigate the links between resilience and coping on the one hand, and stress,
      peritraumatic distress and traumatic stress (acute or PTSD) on the other hand; and (v) to
      measure the impact of COVID infection and of the reduction on the residual plasma
      concentrations of psychotropic medications (especially antipsychotics and lithium).

    <description>The Abbreviated Psychiatric Rating Scale is a clinical scale for measuring symptomatic change in psychiatric inpatients for various conditions. It includes an accurate and complete description of the major characteristic symptoms. It is based both on patient responses and on observations made during the interview by the clinician. The usual reference period is the last two weeks.</description>

    <intervention_name>Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale</intervention_name>
    <description>evaluation of 3 dimensions of psychological distress: depression, anxiety and stress. The scale consists of 21 items and the patient is instructed to choose for each item the one that best corresponds to his or her experience over the past week, on a scale of 0 (&quot;does not apply to me at all&quot;) to 3 (&quot;applies entirely to me, or the vast majority of the time&quot;). A score is calculated for each dimension according to a predefined rating.</description>

    <intervention_name>Impact of Event Scale-Revised</intervention_name>
    <description>is a 22-item self-questionnaire that measures perceived stress in reference to a traumatic event during the previous 7 days. Each item is rated on a scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely) and 3 sub-scores of post-traumatic symptoms are calculated: Revivification, Avoidance, Psychophysiological Activation, as well as a total score of severity of the state of stress. Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) share the same symptoms, the former lasting between 3 days and one month, while the latter is diagnosed when symptoms persist beyond one month. Since the exposure to the stressful event will have occurred less than a month ago, this questionnaire here will help identify a state of acute stress. A total R-ESI score equal to or greater than 33 suggests a significant level of symptoms</description>
