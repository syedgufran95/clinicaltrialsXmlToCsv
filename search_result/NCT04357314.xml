  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In late December 2019, an emerging disease due to a novel coronavirus (named SARS-CoV-2)
      rapidly spread in China and outside. France is currently facing the COVID-19 wave with more
      than 131 863 confirmed cases and almost 25 201 deaths. Systems of care have been reorganized
      in an effort to preserve hospital bed capacity, resources, and avoid exposure of patients to
      the hospital environment where COVID-19 may be more prevalent. Therefore, elective procedures
      of catheterization and programmed hospitalizations have been delayed. However, a significant
      proportion of procedures within the catheterization laboratory such as ST-elevation
      myocardial infarction (STEMI), non ST elevation myocardial infarction or unstable angina are
      mandatory and cannot be postponed. Surprisingly, invasive cardiologist noticed a drop in
      STEMI volume without reliable data to confirm this impression. Furthermore, a recent single
      center report in Hong Kong pointed out longer delays of taking care when compared to patients
      with STEMI treated with percutaneous intervention the previous year. These data are at major
      concern because delay in seeking care or not seeking care could have detrimental impact on
      outcomes.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the rates and characteristics of patients presenting
      with acute myocardial infarction between march 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020 and compared those
      data with those of this year (march 1, 2019 to May 31, 2019).

      The following elements will aslo been collected:

        -  Clinical presentation

        -  Mode of admission (SAMU (Service d'Aide Médicale Urgente in French ie Emergency Medical
           Aid Service) / emergency department / in hospital)

        -  Call for SAMU : delay, number of calls, response

        -  Thrombolysis

        -  Delays (symptom onset to first medical contact / door to balloon)

        -  Final Result : TIMI (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction)

        -  COVID-19 status if known

        -  Underlying known ischemic cardiopathy

        -  ECG (electrocardiogram) Q waves.

        -  Complication after PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention): Discharged date, LVEF (Left
           Ventricular Ejection Fraction), ventricular tachycardia Data will be collected through
           all participating centers under the supervision of the cath lab director.
