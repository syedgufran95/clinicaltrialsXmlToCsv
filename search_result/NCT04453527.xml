  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is a new disease and therefore it is still not clear exactly how the virus affects
      the body and why people are affected so differently. It causes infection in the lungs and the
      virus can then attack blood vessels in the lungs and other organs to spark off an
      inflammatory process that can make a person very ill. It also can cause damage within tiny
      blood vessels that makes a person's blood thicken up and stop flow in vital organs. The
      investigators believe complement (which is a chemical in the body which can be harmful in
      excess) orchestrates the inflammation and thickening of the blood that can make a person
      sick. The investigators now need to know which of these complement chemicals are elevated in
      COVID-19 and compare to healthy volunteers, and assess whether the levels are higher in
      people with severe lung disease. The investigators believe that if levels are increased there
      are special treatments that can counteract them and potentially be an effective treatment for
      COVID-19.

      In this study the investigators will measure different parts of the inflammation process to
      better understand what may be causing severe disease and to see if there may be benefits from
      a new treatment to reduce inflammation

      This study is an observational cross-sectional and cohort study to assess whether there is
      evidence of increased complement activation and/or LTB4 levels and other parameters of
      inflammation and a pro-coagulative state in adult patients hospitalised with COVID-19
      compared to healthy controls and also whether these measures differ with increasing severity
      of respiratory failure.

      Blood samples (serum and plasma) will be obtained from each participant at the time of
      recruitment into the trial, to assess the profile of complement activation, cytokines/
      chemokines, leukotrienes (specifically leukotriene B4) and markers of coagulation and
      inflammation in patients with COVID-19.

      Participants within the cohort study will be recruited at the point of admission or as close
      to it as possible. Baseline sampling will be performed at time of recruitment. There will be
      up to 2 additional sampling points (with not more than one sample per day) if there is any
      worsening of the participants respiratory failure (i.e. deteriorating from mild to moderate
      or moderate to severe disease).

      Patients just admitted to hospital will be asked to consent for both the case control and the
      cohort study

      Data will be collected at baseline for all participants and then again at each further
      sampling point for the participants within the cohort study.

      Patient status will be measured at 14 days from the last point of sampling.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - 1. Adults ≥18 years old requiring hospital admission for COVID-19

        2. COVID-19 confirmed by either*:

          -  A positive swab (using RT-PCR)

          -  OR based on a high level of clinical probability confirmed by the presence of typical
             symptoms and compatible radiological findings on imaging with no alternative cause for
             these findings identified by the treating physician.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Renal replacement therapy on ITU

             2. Significant trauma (including an acute fracture or significant head injury)

             3. Massive transfusion of blood products

             4. Confirmed bacteraemia with pathogenic organism on blood cultures or other severe
             bacterial infections (including abscess/empyema) which persist despite broad-spectrum
             antibiotics and are thought to be significantly contributing to the patient's symptoms
             and clinical state. Recruitment will not be delayed however pending a negative
             culture.
