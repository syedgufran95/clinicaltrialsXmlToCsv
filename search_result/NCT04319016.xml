      Coronaviruses (CoVs) are the largest group of viruses belonging to the Nidovirales order.
      They are enveloped, non-segmented positive-sense RNA viruses.

      Coronavirus are believed to cause a significant proportion of all common colds in adults and
      children. The Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), also known as Wuhan coronavirus, causes the
      2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease. The initial cases of 2019-nCoV occurred in Wuahn, China
      in December 2019.

      A recent review evaluated the potential impact of 2019-nCoV in pregnancy. The authors
      reported published data on CoVs in pregnant women, including 2019-nCoV, severe acute
      respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-COV). The review
      included 12 women with SARS-COV,4 11 women MERS-COV,5 and 9 women with 2019-n-CoV6 in
      pregnancy. No cases of vertical trasmission were reported, but the authors showed an high
      rate of preterm birth (45.8%), cesarean delivery (70.8%), maternal admission to intensive
      care unit (ICU) (63.3%), and maternal death (18.8%).

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of pregnant women
      with 2019-n-CoV.

      This was a multicenter, retrospective, cohort study. Clinical records and compiled data of
      all consecutive hospitalized and outpatient pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed
      2019-n-CoV Data on recent exposure history, clinical symptoms or signs, laboratory findings,
      and maternal and perinatal outcomes were collected. All medical recors were sent to the
      coordinator center. Data were entered into a computerized database and cross-checked. If the
      core data were missing, requests for clarification were sent to the coordinators.
