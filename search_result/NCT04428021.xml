  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date no specific treatment has been proven to be effective for Severe Acute Respiratory
      Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection. It is possible that convalescent plasma that
      contains antibodies to SARS-Cov-2 might be effective against the progression of infection.
      Promising results have been shown by preliminary data from China cases. The investigators
      planned to compare effectiveness of adding COVID-19 convalescent plasma to standard therapy
      protocol (STP) versus adding plasma donated in pre-COVID era versus STP alone in patient with
      COVID-19 within 5 days from the onset of respiratory distress. STP at enrolment is the best
      evidence based therapy approved for treatment of COVID patients by regional Health system
      emergency committee.

      500-700 ml of Plasma will be collected by apheresis from COVID recovered donors showing the
      presence of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-Cov-2 (anti-SARS-Cov-2). All plasma will be
      screened for transmissible diseases according to italian law (Hepatitis B Virus,Hepatitis C
      Virus, Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1-2, Syphilis) plus adjunctive screening for Hepatitis A
      Virus and Hepatitis E Virus-RNA and Parvovirus B19-DNA as requested from Italian National
      Blood Authority. Apheresis will be divided in two/three units (170-300 ml each), virus
      inactivated with Riboflavin and ultraviolet light illumination technology and immediately
      frozen and stored separately from other plasma bags.

      Enrolled patients will be stratified according to severity of respiratory failure and
      randomized in three arms: 1) Standard Therapy Protocol (STP), 2) Standard Therapy Protocol +
      170-350 ml standard Plasma (SP) on day 1-3-5 after randomization, 3) Standard Therapy
      Protocol + 170-350 ml COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma on day 1-3-5 after randomization.

      The three therapeutic units of COVID-19 Convalescent plasma will be chosen in order to
      minimize variations among patients in the total amount of infused SARS-Cov-2 antibodies.
