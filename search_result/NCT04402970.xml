  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate a potential mechanism by which a hyperactive immune
      response may contribute to death from SARS-CoV-2; by an excessive neutrophil-mediated
      deposition of cell-free DNA in neutrophil extracellular traps (NET). Excessive amounts of
      NETs can increase rigidity of mucus, clog airways, and be agents for the development of acute
      respiratory distress (Narasaraju et al., Am J Pathol. 2011). Many aspects of this pathway
      have been observed in severe SARS-CoV-2 (Zhang et al., Respiratory research. 2020). Dornase
      alfa (DNAse I; Pulmozyme (Genentech) is a nebulized drug that works by degrading cell-free
      DNA and thus promoting airway clearance and recovery. The investigators hypothesize that by
      thinning mucus and degrading these NETs further lung damage may be prevented and a reduction
      in time to recovery may occur. The two aims of the study are to see if inhaled/nebulized
      dornase alfa will improve clinical outcome measures in SARS-CoV-2 related acute respiratory
      distress syndrome (ARDS) and to see if dornase alfa reduces the amount of bronchoalveolar
      lavage and blood markers of NET activity.

      The study will recruit patients who are on mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure
      related to SARS-CoV-2 positive infection and have ARDS based upon Berlin criteria.

      The investigators aim to recruit 20 patients for this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection have shown an inflammatory neutrophil and mucus-mediated
      airway exclusion pathway similar to previously described acute respiratory distress syndrome
      (ARDS) in other viral syndromes (Narasaraju et al., Am J Pathol. 2011). Lung neutrophilia in
      ARDS is related to significant neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) production and formation.
      Thus, NET production is likely contributing to the severe lung pathology in SARS-CoV-2 (Yu
      Zuo et al. JCI Insight. 2020). Recent connections have been made between NET formation in
      SARS-CoV-2 patients and excessive thrombosis and the development of cytokine storm further
      warranting evaluation as a potential site for consideration of treatment (Barnes, Betsy et
      al. J exp Med. 2020). Dornase alfa (Pulmozyme) is a recombinant human deoxyribonuclease I,
      that acts as a mucolytic by cleaving extracellular chromosomal DNA from NETs and other
      cell-free DNA. Unknown are the effects of dornase alfa therapy on SARS-CoV-2 related ARDS and
      if therapy with dornase alfa truly reduces the amount of NETs in the severely damaged lungs.

      This study is a non-randomized, single-center, open-label clinical trial to evaluate the
      potential benefit and cellular mechanism of nebulized dornase alfa administration in
      mechanically ventilated patients with SARS-CoV-2 related ARDS. Evaluation of dornase alfa
      effects at a cellular level will be measured by analysis of blood samples before and after
      the 3 days of therapy for cell-free DNA, quantification of citrullinated histone H3,
      quantification of MPO-DNA complexes and analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage samples for
      quantification of NETs and cell count and differential.
