    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in adult subjects with
      Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This clinical trial will evaluate the preliminary safety
      and efficacy of BM-Allo.MSC vs placebo in treating subjects with severe disease requiring
      ventilator support during COVID 19 infection.

Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen
Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen
Not hospitalized, limitation on activities
Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities</description>

The ordinal scale is as follows:
Death
Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)
Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices
Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen
Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>NEWS</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Change in NEWS from baseline.
The following 7 clinical parameters will be assessed:
Respiration rate
Oxygen saturation
Any supplemental oxygen
Temperature
Systolic blood pressure
Heart rate
Level of consciousness
Measurements within normal ranges are assigned a 0. If the measurement in each category is substantially above or below the normal range, it is given a +1, +2, or +3. The more far off than normal, the bigger the number (in each category). A higher number indicates worse outcome. Each category can be 0-3, except for supplemental oxygen which is only 0-2. The highest value a patient can get is 20.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 18 years old.

          2. Able to understand and provide a signed informed consent that fulfills the relevant
             Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) guidelines. For
             subjects that are intubated and/or sedated, or otherwise unable to provide consent,
             prospective consent from a legally-authorized representative is required. The subject
             or his/her legally authorized representative must be able to provide consent.

          3. Has laboratory-confirmed positive novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) test, as determined
             by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or other commercial or public health assay in any
             specimen &lt; 72 hours prior to enrollment, or meets the criteria to guide the evaluation
             and testing of patients under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19
             (https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2020/HAN00428.asp).

          4. Requiring mechanical ventilatory support with moderate to severe Acute Respiratory
             Distress Syndrome (ARDS) as determined by the Berlin criteria:

               1. Bilateral opacities present on a chest radiograph or computed tomographic (CT)
                  scan. These opacities are not fully explained by pleural effusions, lobar
                  collapse, lung collapse, or pulmonary nodules.

               2. Origin of Edema: Respiratory failure not fully explained by cardiac failure or
                  fluid overload.

               3. Oxygenation: Moderate to severe impairment of oxygenation must be present, as
                  defined by the ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fraction of inspired oxygen
                  (PaO2/FiO2). The severity of the hypoxemia defines the severity of the ARDS:

                    -  Moderate: PaO2/FiO2 &gt;100 mmHg and ≤ 200 mmHg, on ventilator settings that
                       include PEEP ≥ 5 cm H2O

                    -  Severe: PaO2/FiO2 ≤100 mmHg on ventilator settings that include PEEP ≥5 cm
                       H2O Subjects receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) will not
                       be enrolled in this study.

          5. High-sensitivity C-reactive Protein (hs-CRP) serum level &gt; 4.0 mg/dL

          6. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE IV) score &gt; 5

          7. Agrees to the collection of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and venous blood per protocol.

          8. Ability to attend required study visits and return for adequate follow-up, as required
             by this protocol.

          9. Agreement to practice effective contraception for female subjects of child-bearing
             potential and non-sterile males. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must agree
             to use effective contraception while on study and for at least 1 month after the last
             dose of BM-Allo.MSC. Non-sterile male subjects must agree to use a condom while on
             study and for up to 1 month after the dose of BM-Allo.MSC. Effective contraception
             includes surgical sterilization (eg, vasectomy, tubal ligation), two forms of barrier
             methods (eg, condom, diaphragm) used with spermicide, intrauterine devices (IUDs),
             oral contraceptives, and abstinence.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known hypersensitivity to any component of the study medication(s).

          2. Signs of multisystem organ failure. Liver function tests (LFTs) &gt; 5x normal.

          3. Intubated &gt; 72 continuous hours.

          4. Assessed by the Investigator to be unable or unwilling to comply with the requirements
             of the protocol.

          5. Pregnant and nursing women. A negative serum pregnancy test during screening (within
             72 hours prior to the first dose) must be documented before MSCs are administered to a
             female subject of child-bearing potential.
