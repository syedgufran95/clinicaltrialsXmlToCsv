  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 disease has been subject to numerous publications since its emergence. Almost
      20% of people suffering from COVID-19 develop severe to critical symptoms and require
      hospitalization, often in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Respiratory failure is the main reason
      for admission in ICU of these patients. Therapeutic strategies implemented for the management
      of critically-ill patients may often lead to short-term muscular and functional alterations
      resulting in ICU-Acquired Weakness (ICUAW). These lead to long-term disabilities expressing
      trough dependence and quality of life impairment of survivors.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the quality of life, dependence and survival at one
      year in patients who survived from COVID-19 in ICU and are admitted in post-ICU setting for
      difficult weaning purpose.

      Ancillary studies aim to assess the course of muscle function (atrophy, structural
      modifications), lung function (loss of aeration) and safety of early mobilization.

      SARS-Cov-2, a virus causing a new infectious disease called COVID-19, has been subject to
      numerous publications since its emergence. Almost 20% of people infected with SARS-Cov-2
      develop severe to critical symptoms and required hospitalization, often in Intensive Care
      Unit (ICU).

      Respiratory failure is the main reason for admission in ICU of patients with COVID-19, which
      develop an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Respiratory failure may be associated
      to liver, renal, coagulation and hemodynamic failure.

      Therapeutic strategies implemented for the management of critically-ill patients with
      COVID-19 may often lead to short-term muscular and functional alterations resulting in
      ICU-Acquired Weakness (ICUAW), as studied in other ICU population.

      The muscular and functional impairments of patients are associated to a longer duration of
      mechanical ventilation and hospital length of stay and increased mortality. Long-term impacts
      are also reported like dependence and quality of life impairment of survivors.

      The COVID-19 pandemic currently leads to an increasing number of ICU admission in France with
      a high risk of settings saturation. Specialized settings for post-ICU rehabilitation are
      preparing to early receive difficult-to-wean patients with ICUAW after admission in ICU for
      severe or critical form of COVID-19.

      To our best knowledge, no data is obviously available regarding at the future of these
      patients in terms of quality of life, dependence or survival. Moreover, no short-term data
      are available concerning the course of lung damages and muscle function after ICU stay. The
      safety of early mobilization usually delivered in patients admitted to post-ICU settings has
      never been assessed in patients with COVID-19.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the quality of life, dependence and survival at one
      year in patients who survived from COVID-19 in ICU and are admitted in post-ICU setting for
      difficult weaning purpose.

      Ancillary studies aim to assess course of muscle function (atrophy, structure modification),
      lung function (loss of aeration) and safety of early mobilization.

    <measure>Change from baseline in lung ultrasound aeration score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day of enrollement, day 14, day 21, day 28 and day 35 from initial admission in ICU</time_frame>
    <description>Lung aeration will be assessed using the Lung Ultrasound Score (LUS). Patient is in semi-recumbent position (30°). Lung ultrasound will be performed in 12 thorax area: anterior, lateral and posterior, each area divided in superior and inferior area, for each hemithorax.
Lung Ultrasound Score will be recorded using a convex probe with a transverse view.
For each thorax area a subscore is calculated: 0 = normal profil; 1 = multiple and well-defined B-lines; 2 = confluent B-lines; 3 = lung consolidation.
Sum of this subscores allows calculation of the total score out of 60. Presence of pleural thickening and subpleural consolidations will be also recorded.</description>
