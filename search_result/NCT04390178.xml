  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no effective treatment for COVID-19 except best supportive care. The aim
      is assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of convalescent plasma for treatment of
      patients with varying degrees of COVID-19 illness. Convalescent plasma has been shown to be
      safe and effective for treatment of several diseases. Preliminary data indicates that it is
      safe and effective for treatment of COVID-19. However, data is limited to small studies and
      case series on severely ill patients. The proposed study assesses the safety and efficacy
      earlier in the course of illness, in slightly less severe patients with the possibility of
      detecting less severe adverse events and the potential for early treatment to hinder the
      development of severe disease. Plasma is collected from consenting donors who have recovered
      from SARS-CoV-2.

The safety of the intervention will be assessed with regard to AEs, baseline medical conditions, and findings from the physical examination and laboratory tests. Possible adverse events will be elicited using a modification and Swedish translation (appendix 6) of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0 and they will be continuously reported to the sponsor. Adverse events related to convalescent plasma therapy shall be followed to assess reversibility.</description>

The first 10 patients will receive 1, 5, 10, 50 and 134 ml of plasma at 30 minute intervals while being closely monitored for adverse events, especially allergic reactions. The remaining twenty patients will receive the convalescent plasma as a slow infusion according to normal routines.</description>
