  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, COVID+ infected patients who are on ambulatory home monitoring self-assess their
      health status simply by completing questionnaires and measuring their temperature twice a
      day. The SECURADOM project proposes to facilitate the follow-up of COVID+ or suspected COVID+
      infected patients, followed at home, by collecting clinical signs on a telephone application
      and to monitor physiological safety parameters (respiratory rate, heart rate, temperature,
      blood pressure, activity) using connected objects developed by the company WITHINGS. This
      daily monitoring, which can be transmitted by patients to the doctors in charge of their
      surveillance, will improve the quality and safety of home monitoring.
