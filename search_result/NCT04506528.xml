    <textblock>
      This cohort study will obtain electronic health record (EHR) de-identified data from 21
      health systems affiliated with the Cancer Center Cessation Initiative (C3I) network or health
      systems with large numbers of COVID-19 patients to explore whether smoking status, cancer
      history, and other risk factors among patients diagnosed with COVID-19 are associated with
      mortality and/or COVID-19 disease severity/complications. Each site will provide
      de-identified data from their health system EHR on a monthly basis that includes all patients
      identified as having COVID-19 at some point in the interval from February 1, 2020, through
      December 31, 2020.

      This cohort study will obtain electronic health record (EHR) de-identified data from 21
      health systems affiliated with the Cancer Center Cessation Initiative (C3I) network or health
      systems with large numbers of COVID-19 patients to explore whether smoking status, cancer
      history, and other risk factors among patients diagnosed with COVID-19 are associated with
      mortality and/or COVID-19 disease severity/complications. The Cancer Center Cessation
      Initiative (C3I) is a project launched by the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) to improve
      the rate at which NCI-designated Cancer Centers provide evidence-based smoking cessation to
      patients diagnosed with and treated for cancer. The C3I is coordinated at the University of
      Wisconsin-Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention (UW-CTRI) and the University of
      Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center (UWCCC). Twenty-one health systems across the U.S. will
      provide EHR de-identified data to the UW-CTRI coordinating center on all COVID-19 patients
      identified during the period from February 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020.

      Current EHR-based data elements collected will include:

      Evidence of COVID-19: ICD-10-CM diagnosis of COVID-19, COVID-19 PCR lab test, and/or COVID-19
      antibody lab test

      Healthcare system encounter type: inpatient, outpatient, emergency department (ED), urgent
      care, or other

      SES/Demographics variables: insurance status, education, housing status, sex, age,
      race/ethnicity, height, weight, body mass index

      Comorbid diseases: chronic asthma, chronic COPD, chronic bronchiectasis, diabetes mellitus,
      cardiovascular disease, chronic renal disease, on dialysis, immunocompromised [due to SLE
      lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, organ transplant, HIV, Crohns], pregnant, cancer (lymphomas,
      leukemias, lung/respiratory, rectal, breast, prostate, pancreas), hypertension, depression,
      anxiety, alcohol abuse, pro- clotting disorders, and anti-clotting disorders

      Tobacco use variables: smoking status (current, former, never), passive smoke exposure for
      never smoker, years since quitting (for former smokers), packs smoked per day, years of
      smoking, pack years, smokeless tobacco user, and marijuana use

      Radiographic tests: chest CTs/MRIs, head CTs/MRIs, abdominal CTs/MRIs, lower extremities
      ultrasound, and cardiac echo

      Signs and symptoms: temperature, pulse, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure,
      oxygen saturation, septic shock, pneumonia, chills, muscle aches/myalgia, rhinorrhea, sore
      throat, chronic cough, shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting, headache, abdominal pain,
      diarrhea, dizziness, impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular event, ataxia, seizure,
      taste impairment, smell impairment, vision impairment, nerve pain, and skeletal muscular pain

      COVID-19 treatment variables: ICU admission, required supplemental oxygen, intubated for
      ventilator use, noninvasive positive pressure, and number of days hospitalized COVID-19
      medications: chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, remdesivir, dexamethasone,
      convalescent plasma, and ascorbic acid

      Classes of other medications used: nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs), varenicline
      medications; blood thinners, steroids, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,
      angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), short-acting adrenergic bronchodilators, long-acting
      adrenergic bronchodilators, anticholinergic bronchodilators, bronchodilators combos, inhaled
      corticosteroids (includes combo medications), and inhaled corticosteroid bronchodilators

      Lab tests: CBC, hematology (e.g., neutrophils, lymphocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit),
      chemistry (e.g., potassium, BUN, creatinine, glucose), liver function tests, coagulation
      (INR, D-dimer), inflammatory markers (e.g., ESR, IL-6, C-reactive protein), troponin,
      Hemoglobin A1C, and tests for various infections

      NOTE: As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves and additional relevant EHR variables are identified
      (e.g., convalescent plasma), they will be added to the list of variables collected.

      For the initial paper(s) to be prepared based on these data, the main analytic methods will
      include GUIDE classification and regression tree models. However, whole sample methods will
      also be used as complementary analytic methods, which will vary with regard to outcome type:
      i.e., logistic regression for binary outcomes and Cox proportional hazard analyses for
      time-to-event outcomes. Initial analyses will focus on hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Later
      waves of analyses may use different analytic approaches and address different questions.
      These will be described in subsequent CT.gov filings.

    <ipd_description>The investigators anticipate that the full de-identified data set will be secured, cleaned, harmonized, and undergo initial analyses through early 2021.The existing Data Transfer and Use Agreements (DTUA) negotiated with each 21 participating health systems precludes the University of Wisconsin (UW) from sharing these data with any entity at this time. This was a requirement of the UW IRB prior to transferring the de-identified site data sets to UW. Thus, until 2021, data will not be distributed outside of the University of Wisconsin. However renegotiation of the DTUAs between the 21 health systems and the University of Wisconsin is anticipated during 2021. The goal is that by the fourth quarter of 2021, UW will have obtained permission to share the de-identified data sets from all of the participating health systems, placing the complete data set in a secure location consistent with HIPAA and IRB requirements, so that other investigators can analyze and use the data.</ipd_description>
