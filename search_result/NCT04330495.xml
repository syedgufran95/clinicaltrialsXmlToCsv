  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to evaluate a strategy of chemoprophylaxis with hydroxyloquine (HCQ)
      against COVID-19 infection in patients diagnosed with an immunomediated inflammatory disease
      who are following a treatment with biological agents and / or Jak inhibitors. The strategy
      will be carried out through a randomised double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial and
      will assess comparative rates of infection (prevalence, incidence), severity including
      mortality, impact on clínical course of the primary diseases and toxicity. Such evaluation
      will require prospective surveillance to assess the different end-points.

      Drug interventions in this protocol will follow the Spanish law about off-label use of
      medicines.
