  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a cross-sectional survey study targeting patients aged 45-75 who had their
      screening or surveillance colonoscopy postponed or delayed due to the COVID pandemic. Study
      staff will survey a random subsample of patients to assess anxiety, COVID risk tolerance,
      cancer worry, willingness to screen and barriers to screening colonoscopy, and preference for
      colonoscopy and alternative colon cancer screening options.

      Eligible patients will be sent a survey packet in the mail that will include a cover letter,
      an information sheet describing the study, an incentive, and the survey. The cover letter
      will include information for participants to opt-out if they desire. Patients will be asked
      to complete the survey and return it back to study staff. Consent is implied with return of
      the survey.

      For the study, staff plan to invite 300 patients and expect to receive 195 completed surveys.
      Analyses will examine whether COVID-19 has changed patients' interest in colon cancer
      screening and the strength of patients' preferences for colonoscopy and other approaches to
      colon cancer screening. It will then examine factors associated with positive and negative
      views on rescheduling colonoscopies such as anxiety, worry, and risk perceptions.

      The study is a cross-sectional survey study targeting patients aged 45-75 who had their
      screening or surveillance colonoscopy postponed or delayed due to the COVID pandemic. Staff
      will survey a random subsample of patients to assess anxiety, COVID risk tolerance, cancer
      worry, willingness to screen and barriers to screening colonoscopy, and preference for
      colonoscopy and alternative colon cancer screening options.

      Study staff will work with the gastroenterology department to identify patients whose
      colonoscopy has been delayed due to COVID-19 and who meet the eligibility criteria. A random
      sample of about 300 eligible patients will be selected for the survey study.

      Eligible patients will be sent a survey packet in the mail that will include a cover letter,
      an information sheet describing the study, an incentive, and the survey. The cover letter
      will include information for participants to opt-out if they desire. Patients will be asked
      to complete the survey and return it back to study staff. Patients will also be able to
      complete the survey online via a RedCap link. Consent is implied with return of the completed
      survey. Staff will make up to three reminder phone calls and will send a reminder packet to
      non responders.

      The study staff will invite 300 patients and expect to receive about 195 completed surveys.

      Analyses will first examine whether there are differences between responders and non
      responders. Then, the analysis will examine descriptive statistics exploring patients'
      interest in colon cancer screening, strength of preference for switching to stool based
      testing or postponing colonoscopy for a year. The analyses will explore patients' perspective
      towards colonoscopy in the coming months and factors associated with positive or negative
      perceptions of colonoscopy such as anxiety, cancer worry, COVID worry and risk perceptions.
      The relationships between these factors will be examined using chi-square analysis (for
      categorical data) and correlations (for continuous data). Models will be used to explore
      factors associated with different preferences for screening.

    <ipd_description>To promote research replicability, transparency and future use of the data, de-identified data sets of the patient survey data will be created and will be available, by request, to outside researchers.
After the main manuscripts have been published, de-identified data sets will also be deposited in an open access service such as, ICPSR (https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/). Before a dataset is made available for access, ICPSR completes a detailed review of all datasets to assess disclosure risk. If necessary, ICPSR modifies data to reduce disclosure risk or limits access to datasets for which modifying the data would substantially limit their utility or the risk of disclosure remains high. No information that contains identifiers or that could be used to link an individual to the data will be included in the de-identified data set.</ipd_description>

    <ipd_time_frame>Three months after the end of the funded grant period, the study materials and de-identified data will be available, by request, from the PI. Once data are placed on an open access service such as ICPSR they will be available indefinitely.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>The PI will share a de-identified data set with outside investigators at no cost, according to approved Partners and Massachusetts General Hospital policies for data sharing. Investigators from other sites will be able to request the data and will be required to complete a data use agreement that ensures that all local Institutional Review Board requirements are met before using the data, that they will not attempt to identify any data in the dataset, and that they will not share the data set with anyone outside their project team.
On ICPSR, individuals must register and agree to ICPSR's Responsible Use statement prior to accessing datasets.</ipd_access_criteria>
