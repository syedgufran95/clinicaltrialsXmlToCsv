  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is insufficient knowledge about transmission routes and the effectiveness of general
      protective measures to prevent infection, such as the closure of schools or the wearing of
      mouthguards. This will be illustrated using the example of the COVID-19 outpatient clinic in
      Solingen and the positive COVID-19 tests registered there.

      Another aspect we would like to address in this study is the number of COVID-19 tests
      performed against the background of political events or dramatic accumulations of COVID-19
      cases in other parts of Germany or Europe. Do speeches by political leaders about the
      COVID-19 situation or a very strong regional spread of infection elsewhere have an impact on
      the frequency with which people react sensitively to suspicious symptoms and undergo testing
      for infection?

      The aim of this study is to analyse the frequency of positive COVID-19 tests and the
      infection chains in Solingen since February 2020:

        1. a prospective survey (telephone contact) of the positively tested patients is done to
           analyze the social environment and thus provide information about possible transmission
           routes. Is transmission mainly within the family through visits from relatives or rather
           through large extra-familial gatherings, such as in the case of the open huts and
           après-ski bars in Ischgl? Are there age- or gender-specific transmission routes
           (personal habits, travel)?

        2. analysis of the number of positive tests in connection with general measures to contain
           the infection (closure of schools, mouthguards obligation, etc.)

        3. characterization of positively tested patients based on anthropometric data and medical
           history.

        4. the effect of political events and developments in world affairs on the daily visitor
           frequency in the COVID-19 outpatient clinic will be retrospectively investigated. Is
           there an accumulation of tests after speeches by politicians or public figures (Angela
           Merkel, Armin Laschet, Queen Elizabeth II, etc.) or after dramatic infection numbers in
           other parts of Germany or Europe (Heinsberg, Ischgl, etc.)?
