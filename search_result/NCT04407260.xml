  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether the use of oxygen hoods as compared to conventional high-flow oxygen
      delivery systems, and the effects on oxygenation, mechanical ventilation and mortality rates
      in hypoxic patients with COVID-19.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether Oxygen hoods improve O2-saturation (SaO2), and how they effect length of
      hospitalization, and in-hospital mechanical ventilation and mortality rates in Covid-19
      patients when compared to conventional high-flow oxygen delivery systems. Oxy-hemoglobin
      saturation is continuously measured by pulse-oximetry including immediately before and after
      oxygen hood placement, and will be measured in controls.

      Comparison/Control Group The control cohort includes COVID-19 patients presenting for
      treatment prior to 4/3/20 when hyperbaric oxygen hoods were not available. Patients
      maintained on, or those failing on conventional O2- delivery systems and subsequently
      receiving mechanical ventilation will be studied.

      All patients included must have tested positive using PCR swabs and/or been diagnosed based
      on clinical/laboratory standard diagnostic criteria. Medical management will include evolving
      treatment regimens and other standard medical treatments widely used at time of study in all
      hypoxic COVID-19 patients.

      Prognostic/confounding covariates are to be collected through Electronic Medical Record (EMR)
      chart review and compared between intervention and control cohorts. including: Age, Body Mass
      Index (BMI), Gender, Chronic Lung disease - COPD, Asthma (CLD), cardiovascular disease - CAD,
      CHF, Chronic Dysrhythmia (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), Immunosuppression - History of
      Cancer, Immunosuppressive medication, HIV (Immunosuppression), Diabetes Mellitus (DM), and
      pertinent lab markers.

      Routine follow-up evaluation is maintained until final in-hospital outcomes are known
      including:

        1. Oxygen Difference pre/post-hood (SaO2 difference, %)

        2. Intubation/MV status (Intubated)

        3. Survival/Mortality (Expired)

        4. Hospital Length of Stay (LOS, days)

      Randomization/Blinding Randomization is not possible as it is unethical to deny a hypoxic
      patient an alternative approved means of oxygenation for patients failing on conventional
      oxygen delivery systems. No blinding of participants or investigators.
