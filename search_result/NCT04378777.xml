  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This surveillance study will collect detailed clinical, laboratory, and radiographic data in
      coordination with biologic sampling of blood and respiratory secretions and viral shedding in
      nasal secretions in order to identify immunophenotypic and genomic features of COVID-19
      -related susceptibility and/or progression. The aim: for the results obtained from this study
      to assist in generating hypotheses for effective host-directed therapeutic interventions, to
      help to prioritize proposals for such interventions, and/or optimize timing for
      administration of host-response directed therapeutics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational cohort surveillance study of up to 2,000 adult
      participants hospitalized with known or presumptive COVID-19. Detailed information will be
      collected regarding patient history and onset of illness upon enrollment. Participants will
      undergo longitudinal assessments of clinical status and pertinent clinical data (including
      clinical laboratory values, radiographic findings, medication use, oxygen and ventilatory
      support requirements, complications, etc.) will be recorded. In parallel, the study will
      conduct serial biologic sampling for detailed immunophenotyping to provide a comprehensive
      picture of immune changes that occur throughout the course of infection. The biologic samples
      to be collected for this observational study include blood, nasal swabs, and endotracheal
      aspirates.

      Participants will be followed in hospital through Day 28, unless discharged earlier. If a
      participant requires an escalation to Intensive Care Unit (ICU)-level care, either within or
      outside of a dedicated ICU, additional samples will be collected within 24 and 96 hours of
      care escalation. Convalescent questionnaires and biologic samples will be collected at
      3-month intervals up to Month 12 after infection symptom onset, if available. In addition, if
      a participant is discharged from the hospital prior to Day 28, attempts will be made to
      collect additional scheduled assessments through Day 28 on an outpatient basis, if feasible.
