      A population-based COVID19 surveillance in a household cohort will be set-up using an
      existing Household demographic surveillance system (HDSS). From any individual in this
      population with any respiratory symptom or loss of smell or taste, with or without fever,
      investigators will collect a respiratory specimen and test these for SARS-CoV-2 virus, during
      12 months. Demographic, epidemiological and clinical data of possible cases and of the source
      population will be recorded at baseline.

      An age-stratified serial sero-survey will be conducted at baseline in a subset of the
      population in the population-based COVID19 surveillance, and at 3, 6 and 12 months, after
      confirmation of community transmission.

      The investigators will use the established HDSS to set up population-based COVID19
      surveillance in a household cohort. From any individual in this population with any
      respiratory symptom or loss of smell or taste, with or without fever, investigators will
      collect a respiratory specimen and test these for SARS-CoV-2 virus by PCR, during 12 months.
      These cases will be identified through bi-weekly household visits, through an alert system
      involving community leaders and HDSS interviewers, or when presenting with symptoms at
      healthcare centres or the referral hospital. Demographic, epidemiological and clinical data
      (comorbidities, medication, obesity, HIV, TB, smoking) of possible cases and of the source
      population will be recorded at baseline; recent illness, potential risk exposure of each
      household member (including duration and type) to SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals, uptake of
      measures to reduce exposure/transmission, and barriers to the uptake of such measures, will
      be recorded/updated during every household visit.

      An age-stratified serial sero-survey will be conducted at baseline in a subset of the
      population in the population-based COVID19 surveillance, and at 3, 6 and 12 months, after
      confirmation of community transmission.

        The Polana Caniço-HDSS (Health- and Demographic Surveillance System) has been established
        since 2017. In total, 2108 households (defined as residents of the same building, sharing a
        cooking area) have been enrolled in the HDSS. All members residing in the household for at
        least 3 months (infants, children, adults, elderly) are enrolled in the HDSS.

        All households in the HDSS (2108 during the last round, in 2019) consenting to participate
        in the study will be visited biweekly by a trained HDSS interviewer, following the same
        procedures as in routine HDSS rounds, specified in the HDSS protocol (Instituto Nacional de
        Saude, 2016). We assume the same number of households will consent to participate as in
        other HDSS rounds.
