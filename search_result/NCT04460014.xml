  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is designed to investigate the effects of a remotely delivered simple
      cognitive task (a memory cue followed by playing the computer game &quot;Tetris&quot; with mental
      rotation instructions) on intrusive memories (&quot;flashbacks&quot;) and other symptoms after a
      traumatic event(s). Hospital staff who experienced a work-related traumatic event(s) during
      the COVID-19 pandemic will be randomly allocated to either the simple cognitive task
      intervention or control. Randomization to assigned intervention occurs on Day 1, after
      completion of baseline measures (note: baseline measures are not used in randomization
      process). Baseline measures include questionnaires on Day 1 and an intrusive memory diary
      during the previous week (Week -1). Participants will be followed up at one week and one
      month, and where possible 3 and 6 months. It is predicted that participants given the simple
      cognitive task intervention will develop fewer intrusive memories, less severe related
      clinical symptoms, and will show higher functioning (e.g. at work) than those who are not.
      This will inform the future development of a simple technique to prevent distressing
      psychological symptoms after a traumatic event(s). Implementation and training aspects
      regarding remote recruitment and intervention delivery in a hospital context will also be
      explored. Participants use e.g. their smartphone for part of the intervention in the study.

    <textblock>
      This is a Randomised Controlled Trial informed by prior feasibility and pilot work
      (ClinicalTrials.gov IDs: NCT03509792, NCT04185155). The primary outcome is the number of
      intrusive memories of the traumatic event(s) (week 5). The intervention is delivered remotely
      (e.g. via smartphone) with potential remote support (e.g. by phone) to medical staff in
      Swedish hospitals.

    <measure>Intrusion questionnaire - frequency item</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Week 1 and 5 and 1, 3, and 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>A single item measuring the frequency of intrusive/unwanted memories of the traumatic event(s) in the previous week on a 7-point scale (from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;many times a day&quot;, with a follow-up question to specify the number if necessary) that will be used as a convergent measure for medical hospital staff who may face time constraints completing the diary.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intrusion questionnaire - characteristics</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), One week and 1, 3, and 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>5 self-rated items measuring the characteristics of intrusive/unwanted memories in the previous week.
The level of distress, nowness, reliving, disconnectedness and whether different triggers are associated with the intrusive/unwanted memories of the traumatic event(s) are measured on a 101-point scale (from 0 to 100). Higher scores indicate more intrusive/unwanted memories, higher levels of distress/nowness/reliving/disconnectedness and a greater number of different triggers.</description>

    <measure>Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R): Degree of subjective distress of post-trauma intrusion and avoidance symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), One week and 1, 3, and 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report measure that assesses subjective distress after a traumatic event (with reference to study event[s]) in the last week. Here we include the intrusion subscale (8 items) and the avoidance subscale (8 items). Items are rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;extremely&quot;). Subscale scores are calculated for the Intrusion or Avoidance items summed (ranging from 0 to 32 each). Higher scores indicate worse outcome.</description>

    <description>The PCL-5 short version is an 8-item self-report measure that assesses current symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder in the last month [Baseline (Day 1), 1, 3, and 6 month follow-up] and in the last week (One week). Items are rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;extremely&quot;). The PCL-5 short version yields a total symptom severity score which ranges from 0 to 32. Subscale symptom severity scores for DSM-5 symptom cluster B - intrusion symptoms (items 1-2), cluster C - avoidance (items 3-4), cluster D - negative alterations in cognitions and mood (items 5-6), and cluster E - alterations in arousal and reactivity (items 7-8). Higher scores indicate worse severity.</description>
