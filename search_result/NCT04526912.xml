  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to assess the potential benefit and evaluate the safety and tolerability of a
      single subcutaneous (SC) dose of VIB7734 in hospitalized patients with documented infection
      of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) with pulmonary involvement.
      Subjects will be administered a single dose of VIB7734 injected under the skin, assessed for
      efficacy for 28 days and followed for an additional 42 days.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study intended to assess the potential
      benefit and evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single subcutaneous (SC) dose of
      VIB7734 in hospitalized patients with documented infection of severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) with pulmonary involvement. Efficacy will be assessed
      during the 28 days following a single administration of VIB7734. Safety will be assessed for
      10 weeks following dosing. The pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and
      immunogenicity of VIB7734 in patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections will also be
      assessed.
