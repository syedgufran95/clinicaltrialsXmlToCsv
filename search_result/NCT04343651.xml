      This is a Phase 2, two-arm, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled multicenter study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of leronlimab (PRO 140) in patients with mild-to-moderate
      symptoms of respiratory illness caused by coronavirus 2019 infection. Patients will be
      randomized to receive weekly doses of 700 mg leronlimab (PRO 140), or placebo. Leronlimab
      (PRO 140) and placebo will be administered via subcutaneous injection.

      The study will have three phases: Screening Period, Treatment Period, and Follow-Up Period.

      A total of 75 subjects will be randomized 2:1 in this study.

             viral load and are on a stable ART regimen. Investigators are required to review the
             subjects' medical records to confirm HIV-1 RNA suppression within the previous 3
             months.

             Note: Empirical antibiotic treatment for secondary bacterial infections is allowed
             during the course of study.

          9. Patients who are participating in other clinical trials;

         10. Patients who have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar
