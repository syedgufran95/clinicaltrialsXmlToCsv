      This prospective phase I/IIa trial studies the side effects of rintatolimod and Intron A
      (IFNa) alpha-2b in treating cancer patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 infection.
      Interferon alpha is a protein important for defense against viruses. It activates immune
      responses that help to clear viral infection. Rintatolimod is double stranded ribonucleic
      acid (RNA) designed to mimic viral infection by stimulating immune pathways that are normally
      activated during viral infection. Giving rintatolimod and interferon alpha-2b may activate
      the immune system to limit the replication and spread of the virus.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of the combination of intravenous (i.v.) rintatolimod administered
      with or without i.v. IFN alpha (recombinant interferon alfa-2b in patients with cancer with
      mild or moderate COVID-19.

      II. To determine the kinetics of viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs in the course of
      treatment and days 14 and 30.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  I. To assess the efficacy of the treatment combination in patients with cancer with mild
           or moderate COVID-19

        -  II.Determine the kinetics of viral load in the peripheral blood in the course of
           treatment and days 14 and 30

        -  III. Determine the kinetics of changes of the immune subsets and circulating
           inflammatory mediators (including C-reactive protein [CRP], cytokines, chemokines,
           interferons) in peripheral blood in the course of treatment and days 14 and 30.

        -  IV. Determine the induction of known mediators of antiviral immunity that include
           (myxovirus resistance gene, MxA; protein Kinase R (PKR); oligoadenylate synthetase-2
           (OAS2); RNAse-L, IFN-stimulated gene-15 (ISG15); IFN-induced proteins with
           tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT1) and IFN-inducible transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3),
           TLR3, RIG-I, MDA5, IRF3, IRF7, in nasopharyngeal swabs material and blood cells of
           patients on all tiers of treatment. Expression of ACE2 (receptor for SARS-Cov-2 entry)
           and potentially other genes involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection will be tested in
           nasopharyngeal samples

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of recombinant interferon alfa-2b.

      Patients receive rintatolimod IV over 2.5-3 hours and recombinant interferon alfa-2b IV over
      20 minutes on days 1, 3, 5, and 8 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed up at days 14 and 30 after initiation of the study regimen.
