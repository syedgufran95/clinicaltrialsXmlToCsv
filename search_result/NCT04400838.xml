      A phase 2/3 study to determine the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the candidate
      Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in healthy UK volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be 11 study groups and it is anticipated that a total of 12,330 volunteers will be
      enrolled. Groups 1, 7 &amp; 9 are adults aged 56-69 years; groups 2, 8 &amp; 10 are adults 70 years
      and over; group 3 is children aged 5-12 years inclusive; groups 4, 5, 6 &amp; 11 are adults aged
      18-55 years.

      All subjects will undergo follow-up for a total of 1 year post last vaccination. Additional
      visits or procedures may be performed at the discretion of the investigators, e.g., further
      medical history and physical examination, or additional blood tests and other investigations
      if clinically relevant

             requirements.

          -  Willing to allow the investigators to discuss the volunteer's medical history with
             their General Practitioner and access all medical records when relevant to study
             procedures.

          -  For females of childbearing potential only, willingness to practice continuous
             effective contraception (see below) during the study and a negative pregnancy test on
             the day(s) of screening and vaccination.

          -  Agreement to refrain from blood donation during the course of the study.

          -  Provide written informed consent.

        due to COVID-19. The COV002 study team should be informed as soon as possible.

        • Participation in SARS-CoV-2 serological surveys where participants are informed of their
        serostatus for the duration of the study.

        Note: Disclosure of serostatus post enrolment may accidently unblind participants to group
        allocation. Participation in COV002 can only be allowed if volunteers are kept blinded to
        their serology results from local/national serological surveys

          -  Receipt of any vaccine (licensed or investigational) other than the study intervention
             within 30 days before and after each study vaccination, with the exception of the

             vaccination at least 7 days before or after their study vaccine.

          -  Prior or planned receipt of an investigational or licensed vaccine or product likely
             to impact on interpretation of the trial data (e.g. Adenovirus vectored vaccines, any
             coronavirus vaccines). This exclusion criteria will not apply to group 11, as
             recruitment will be targeted at those volunteers who previously received a ChAdOx1
             vectored vaccine.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months
             preceding the planned administration of the vaccine candidate.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient state; asplenia;
             recurrent severe infections and use of immunosuppressant medication within the past 6
             months, except topical steroids or short-term oral steroids (course lasting ≤14 days)

             ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or MenACWY

          -  Any history of angioedema.

          -  Any history of anaphylaxis.

          -  Pregnancy, lactation or willingness/intention to become pregnant during the study.

          -  Current diagnosis of or treatment for cancer (except basal cell carcinoma of the skin
             and cervical carcinoma in situ).

          -  History of serious psychiatric condition likely to affect participation in the study.

          -  Bleeding disorder (e.g. factor deficiency, coagulopathy or platelet disorder), or

             venepuncture.

          -  Continuous use of anticoagulants, such as coumarins and related anticoagulants (i.e.
             warfarin) or novel oral anticoagulants (i.e. apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran and
             edoxaban)

          -  Suspected or known current alcohol or drug dependency.

          -  Any other significant disease, disorder or finding which may significantly increase
             the risk to the volunteer because of participation in the study, affect the ability of
             the volunteer to participate in the study or impair interpretation of the study data.

          -  Severe and/or uncontrolled cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease,
             gastrointestinal disease, liver disease, renal disease, endocrine disorder and
             neurological illness (mild/moderate well controlled comorbidities are allowed)

          -  History of laboratory confirmed COVID-19. o Seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2 before

        reactions likely to be exacerbated by Paracetamol

        o Note: Caution should be taken when recommending paracetamol to adults who already take
        paracetamol chronically

             Trisomy 21)

          -  Fulfil any of the contraindications to vaccination as specified in The Green Book

        Re-vaccination exclusion criteria (two-dose groups only)

          -  Anaphylactic reaction following administration of vaccine

          -  Pregnancy
