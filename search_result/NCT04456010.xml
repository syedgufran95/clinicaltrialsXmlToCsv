  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-urgent medical care, such as fertility treatments, has been massively postponed during
      the past weeks due to the COVID19 pandemic. The lockdown and the closure of IVF centers might
      cause anxiety and depression among infertile couples, who are already exposed to the
      distressing experience of infertility and for whom the wait for a baby already appears
      unending. Few data are available regarding the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on pregnant women and
      foetus, or on fertility.

      This study aims to assess the views of infertile couple regarding the potential risks of
      COVID during their fertility treatment and their personal experience of the COVID pandemic
      and their expectation for further treatment .
