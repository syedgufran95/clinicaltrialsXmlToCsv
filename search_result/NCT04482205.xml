      Covid-19 has adversely impacted the health care organizations by over burdening with Covid
      patients and suspending the elective surgeries and clinics A single center retrospective
      study was conducted to quantify losses due to postponement of elective surgeries and extra

      Covid-19 has impacted adversely the economy of Pakistan that has already poor and challenged
      socioeconomic conditions This is a single hospital retrospective cross sectional study
      conducted to quantify losses due postponement of elective surgeries and procurement of PPEs
      and see the effect of Covid -19 on the total costs of inpatient care during Covid era.

      We included all the patients admitted in orthopedic section for operative intervention of
      fractures and elective procedures from January 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020. We divided this
      period into two halves; the first half was from January first to March 15 named as PreCovid
      Era and second half was from March 16, to May 31, 2020, termed as Covid Era. The total number
      of trauma procedures and elective procedures were compared in both eras. We compared six
      procedures each from upper and lower limit for cost analysis and length of stay. We also
      analyzed the extra cost for procurement of PPEs.
