  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Access to mental health care by essential workers and the unemployed during the COVID19
      pandemic has been challenging. Usual access to mental health care is limited by social
      distancing, and for many now unemployed due to closures of businesses, insurance is
      insufficient to cover the costs of mental health care. For these individuals who are at risk
      for suicide (isolation, unemployment, financial crisis plus past suicide attempts,
      significant mental health challenges), access to care is crucial and many maybe turning to
      online and accessible interventions, such as mental health apps and other online resources.
      Indeed, organizations such as the VA have already created free access mobile applications for
      mental health in anticipation of this need. Using Psyberguide, the investigators will
      identify the top ten free apps that address mental health issues and conduct a nation-wide
      evaluation of these apps with participants who are essential workers and unemployed with risk
      for suicide. Participants will first be surveyed about which strategies they have used to
      manage mental health issues, what apps and online tools they have used, and what usability
      challenges they have faced. The investigators will then ask a random sample of participant to
      engage in a randomized trial of these top-rated apps for 4 weeks. Apps will be rated on
      usability, acceptability, feasibility and effectiveness. Results from this trial will be
      quickly disseminated through several avenues: (1) the UWAC website and ALACRITY Centers
      network; (2) through CREATIV Lab's partnership with Mental Health America; (3) through the UW
      Center for Suicide Prevention and Recovery (CSPAR) and partnerships with other suicide
      focused organizations including Forefront, the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention,
      that American Association of Suicidology, the Rocky Mountain MIRECC, and the Defense Suicide
      Prevention Office and (4) through local partnership with King County and WA state contact
      tracers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be recruited nationally via mTURK. Phase 1 will enroll 2,000 participants
      who are essential workers and/or unemployed due to COVID-19 and have a past history of mental
      health issues or experiencing suicide ideation motivational risk factors. Participants will
      be asked about their mental health needs, challenges they face accessing care, and strategies
      they have used to manage their mental health. All participants will then be shown App Store
      descriptions of ten apps that have received the highest rating by PsyberGuide, a non-profit
      company that consistently rates existing apps for their safety, data privacy and user
      ratings. Participants will provide initial impressions on the acceptability and feasibility
      of using these apps. The investigators will then ask participants if they would be willing to
      participate in a randomized trial to test these apps, with the aim of recruiting 1000
      participants. Participants will be randomized (100 per group) to one of the ten apps. They
      will be asked to download their assigned app and use it for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks of use,
      participants will be asked to provide an evaluation of acceptability, feasibility and
      usability of the app, how often they used the app, and if they found the app helpful.
      Participants will also be asked to complete clinical outcome measures.

    <time_frame>Change from baseline PHQ-9 at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 consists of 9 depression items and one disability item. Each time is associated with a DSM symptom of depression, which the participant rates whether or not they have experienced the symptom over the last two weeks, with severity rating of 0-3. It is one of the few measures that is brief (it takes less than one minute to give) and has been found to have excellent sensitivity to change over time.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline GAD-7 at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 7- item screener for generalized anxiety. It consists of items related to GAD. Participants rate on a scale of 0-3 how much they have experienced in the last two weeks. The scale is a valid screener for GAD.</description>

This scale has very high internal consistency with Alpha coefficients of 0.94 for females and 0.93 for males in both groups, furthermore reliability of 0.94 for students and 0.93 for depressed group.</description>

    <description>This 16-item scale asks participants to indicate on a 5-point scale the degree to which the items represent their thoughts and feelings. The response options are 0 = 'not at all like me', 1 = 'a little bit like me', 2 = 'moderately like me', 3= 'quite a bit like me' and 4 = 'extremely like me'. Gilbert and Allan (1998) reported high levels of internal consistency for both student and depressed groups, with Cronbach's alphas respectively of .93 and .86 in Internal Entrapment, and .88 and .89 in External Entrapment.</description>
