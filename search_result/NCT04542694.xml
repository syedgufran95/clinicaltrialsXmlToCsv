      Upon signing the informed consent form and screening, 200 eligible patients with polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR) confirmed COVID-19 are randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive either
      Favipiravir 1600 mg twice a day (BID) on Day 1 followed by 600 mg BID on Days 2-14 (1600/600
      mg), or SOC. The course of treatment by Favipiravir is 14 days.
