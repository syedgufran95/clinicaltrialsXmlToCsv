  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy of administering a
      dietary supplement containing resistant starch to non-hospitalized COVID-19 positive
      subjects, The intervention will begin as soon as possible after subjects test positive for
      COVID-19 and continue for 14 days. Investigators hypothesize that short-term administration
      of a dietary supplement containing resistant starch has the potential to reduce rates of
      hospitalization and improve time to clinical recovery and symptoms in non-hospitalized
      COVID-19 positive patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a substantial strain on the healthcare system, with at least
      14% of infected patients requiring hospitalization. Identifying ways to ameliorate the
      progression and severity of the COVID-19 infection and preventing hospitalization is
      critical. Patients suffering from COVID-19 have been shown to have a significant inflammatory
      response resembling that of cytokine release syndrome, and it is this inflammatory phase that
      is thought to drive fatality.

      To this end, a multi-center randomized clinical trial to determine the efficacy of resistant
      starch in reducing the need for hospitalization for COVID-19 positive patients will be
      studied. This study will enroll 1500 non-hospitalized COVID-19 positive individuals who are
      being monitored in the outpatient setting. Patients will be randomized to either a dietary
      supplement containing resistant starch or a placebo for 14 days. Our primary outcome is the
      rate of hospitalization for COVID-19 related complications. Secondary outcomes will look at
      time to recovery and symptom severity scores.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to clinical recovery (TTCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>One month from the start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Time to clinical recovery will be defined by a return to normal body temperature (97-99 degrees F) as reported by the patient, and resolution of major presenting symptoms (myalgia, cough, shortness of breath, and GI symptoms) maintained for 72 hours. Patients will be called every 2 days for the first 14 days of the study, and then once weekly for the following 14 days to assess symptoms via a pre-specified questionnaire. Patients will continue to be followed for an additional 3 months by electronic medical record review.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptom Severity Score</measure>
    <time_frame>One month from the start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This score will be evaluated using a subjective self-reporting questionnaire around 8 symptoms, which include: shortness of breath at rest or exertion, fatigue, myalgia/muscle aces, fever, cough, headache, GI symptoms, inability to taste or smell. Subjects will rate each of their symptoms on an ordinal scale as follows: absent (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3). These symptom ratings will be added to define the symptom severity score with a possible score range of 0-24 points. Subjects will be called every 2 days for the first 14 days of the study, and then once weekly for the following 14 days to assess symptoms via this pre-specified questionnaire. Patients will continue to be followed for an additional 3 months via EHR review.</description>
