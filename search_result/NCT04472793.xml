  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is 1) to conduct a prospective longitudinal surveillance
      research trial, enrolling up to 200 CCHMC employees as they come back to work, and then
      following their clinical and laboratory parameters for up to 12 months; and 2) to support the
      ongoing development of diagnostic techniques for COVID-19. The overall goal is to investigate
      patterns of SARS-COV-2 infection, including immunological recovery and genetic risk factors,
      among CCHMC employees to better understand how to safely reintroduce the CCHMC work force
      back into their normal routines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As the global and pandemic spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19) continues,
      many knowledge gaps remain with regard to the epidemiology and transmission of infection, as
      well as the normal immunological responses after viral exposure. Cincinnati only recently
      (March 14, 2020) had its first confirmed case of COVID-19, and through shelter-in-place and
      social distancing efforts, has avoided the community spread experienced by some other large
      metropolitan areas. As investigators contemplate the gradual reintroduction of the Cincinnati
      Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) workforce back into the hospital, it is imperative
      that investigators determine the current prevalence of infection among CCHMC employees,
      measure the cumulative incidence of infection over the next 12 months, investigate the normal
      antibody patterns after infection, and help elucidate what constitutes a protective
      immunological response. Investigators have a unique but time-limited opportunity to optimally
      track the epidemiology and natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection at CCHMC, including risk
      factors for transmission and immunological recovery. RETURN will investigate epidemiological
      and immunological features of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in a limited cohort of CCHMC
      employees, as they return from the current shelter-at-home directive toward a normal work
      environment. By collecting and analyzing weekly serial samples for SARS-CoV-2 (nasal swab for
      virus by PCR) and monthly serological exposure (serum antibodies by ELISA), investigators
      will determine the prevalence and cumulative incidence of exposure to SARS-CoV-2; document
      the antibody responses over time; identify cases of apparent viral recrudescence or
      re-infection; and create models of transmission risk among CCHMC employees.
