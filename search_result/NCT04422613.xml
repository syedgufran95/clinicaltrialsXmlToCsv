  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARS-CoV-2, name of the Coronavirus Group of international
      Committee on taxonomy of viruses, is an emerging virus from the family of coronaviridae,
      responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. This infection can progress to viral pneumonia, and in
      3% of cases up to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which conditions the prognosis
      of the disease.

      Due to its unusual clinical presentation with a risk of sudden deterioration on the 8th day
      as a result of possible hyperinflammatory response, the respiratory impairment of COVID is
      unique and many questions remain unanswered concerning its evolution once the acute phase has
      passed. Knowledge of the evolution of pulmonary involvement, particularly in patients
      requiring hospitalization, can help reduce the morbidity linked to the persistent
      abnormalities identified by establishing early therapeutic management. It can also provide a
      better understanding of the mechanisms of pulmonary involvement in the acute phase. Current
      data regarding the acute phase of COVID-19 suggest that persistent abnormalities remain
      distant from this infection at all levels of the respiratory system: gas exchange, perfusion,
      ventilatory mechanics, and interstitial lung disease.

      The main objective is to characterize persistent gas exchange anomalies 4 months after
      documented COVID-19 pneumonia, resulting in oxygen desaturation and requiring
      hospitalization.
