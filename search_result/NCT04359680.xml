        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females at least 18 years of age or of legal consenting age based on local
             requirements.

          2. Persons at increased risk of contracting COVID-19, including:

               1. Healthcare workers with known direct occupational exposure to COVID-19 within 7
                  days prior to enrollment. A qualifying person (i) provides healthcare to patients
                  and/or (ii) typically positions themselves within 6 feet of patients (&quot;close
                  contact&quot;) and (iii) is a full- time employee (average of â‰¥ 24 hours/week) in a
                  high contact area (Emergency Department, Intensive Care Unit, COVID-specific Care
                  Unit, Walk-in Clinic, Paramedic/First Responder).

               2. Persons participating in social activities without the practice of generally
                  accepted social distancing practices at least three times per week. Qualifying
                  activities include the presence of at least 10 people in close (&lt;6 feet)
                  proximity to each other without masks or other personal protective equipment
                  (e.g., socializing at bars or community/social centers, in-home social
                  gatherings, classes or trainings, etc.). These subjects must have engaged in such
                  activities at least three times in the past 7 days and plan to continue these
                  activities during the study.

          3. Must have a smartphone, tablet, computer, or other qualifying internet- enabled device
             and daily internet access.

          4. Occupational exposure to a person infected with SAR-CoV-2 within 7 days prior to
             enrollment or social interaction as defined in criterion 2(b).

          5. Willing and able to provide written informed consent and comply with the requirements
             of the protocol, including completion of the subject diary.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects not at increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 from occupational or social
             behaviors.

          2. Subjects with known severe heart, lung, neurological or other systemic disease that
             the Investigator believes could preclude safe participation.

          3. Subjects with a history of COVID-19 or known to have developed anti- SARS-CoV-2
             antibodies.

          4. Subjects who experienced a previous episode of acute upper respiratory tract
             infection, otitis, bronchitis or sinusitis or received antibiotics for these
             conditions or antiviral therapy for influenza within two weeks prior to and including
             study day 1.

          5. Subjects residing in the same household with another family member currently
             participating in the study.

          6. Receipt of any dose of NTZ within 7 days prior to screening.

          7. Treatment with any investigational drug or vaccine therapy within 30 days prior to
             screening and willing to avoid them during the course of the study.

          8. Known sensitivity to NTZ or any of the excipients comprising the study medication.

          9. Subjects unable to swallow oral tablets or capsules.

         10. Females of childbearing potential who are either pregnant or sexually active without
             the use of birth control. Female subjects of child-bearing potential that are sexually
             active must have a negative baseline pregnancy test and must agree to continue an
             acceptable method of birth control for the duration of the study and for 1 month
             post-treatment. A double barrier method, oral birth control pills administered for at
             least 2 monthly cycle prior to study drug administration, an (intrauterine device)
             IUD, or medroxyprogesterone acetate administered intramuscularly for a minimum of one
             month prior to study drug administration are acceptable methods of birth control for
             inclusion into the study. Female subjects are considered of childbearing potential
             unless they are postmenopausal (absence of menstrual bleeding for 1 year or 6 months
             if laboratory confirmation of hormonal status), or have had a hysterectomy, bilateral
             tubular ligation or bilateral oophorectomy.

         11. Females who are breastfeeding.

         12. Subjects with active respiratory allergies or subjects expected to require
             anti-allergy medications during the study period for respiratory allergies.

         13. Subjects taking medications considered to be major CYP2C8 substrates.

         14. Subjects who, in the judgment of the Investigator, will be unlikely to comply with the
             requirements of this protocol including completion of the subject diary.
