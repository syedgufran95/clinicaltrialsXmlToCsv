  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID19 pandemic currently represents a public health emergency. Based on current data, 15%
      of the affected individuals will develop a severe form of the disease requiring admission to
      hospital and respiratory support. Data show that age and cardiovascular pre-existing
      comorbidities predict a poorer outcome. Some evidence suggests that a subset of patients with
      poorer outcome present with a cytokine mediated inflammatory response and with a secondary
      HLH like clinical phenotype. No data are so far available with regard to the risk of severe
      COVID19 disease in the post stem cell transplantation setting. Recipients of allogeneic stem
      cell transplantation are by definition immunologically dysregulated and could potentially
      present with a unique immune-inflammatory response to COVID 19 infection. Moreover, the
      immunosuppression used to prevent/treat GVHD may also impact clinical progression and it is
      possible that because of their immunological defects, SCT patients could potentially have
      prolonged carriage of the virus and hence act as &quot;super spreaders&quot;.

      The present study aims at documenting clinical and biological characteristics, including
      immunological profiling, of allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients presenting with severe
      COVID 19 infection and its impact on patients survival. This work may provide the scientific
      basis for targeted therapy with biological agents in this patient group.

      The transplant teams in each participating site will be identifying and approaching eligible
      patients. Adult and paediatric patients with a history of allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation who are admitted to hospital with a proven severe COVID19 infection will be
      eligible for the study. Within 72 hrs of admission, a 10 ml clotted blood (5 mls for pts
      below 15 kg weight) will be collected and serum frozen at -80 C. This sample will be sent
      with a 10ml blood sample (5 mls for pts below 15 kg weight) in EDTA to the Immunology
      Laboratories at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) in London for centralized cytokine and
      lymphocyte subset analysis. The sample will be divided into 2 aliquots, one being analyzed
      directly, the second one being frozen for further assays as developed. Other immunological
      and biochemical parameters will be tested locally and results with local reference ranges
      will be collected for the purpose of the current study.

      In case the patient deteriorates further from the respiratory perspective requiring either
      CPAP or mechanical ventilation, a second 5 ml serum sample may be collected, frozen at -80 C
      and sent to GOSH for repeated cytokine analysis.

      HScore will be calculated as per published data but bone marrow aspiration will be optional
      in calculating the scoring given the expected acute clinical situation of the patient.
      (Fardet et al, Arthritis Rheumatol 2014).

      Transplant research team members will collect demographic and clinical characteristics at the
      time samples are sent to GOS. Blood results, data on clinical course, therapy (including
      biological agents) and outcome data will be collected with a follow up survey 30 and 100 days
      after start of supplemental oxygen therapy for COVID19 infection.
