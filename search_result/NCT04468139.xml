  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are currently no antiviral drugs with proven efficacy nor are there vaccines for its
      prevention. Unfortunately, the scientific community has little knowledge of the molecular
      details of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The drugs we are chosen are used as clinical trials for
      antiviral and there is no proven guide for specificity and effectiveness against the virus so
      the results are different Now the clinical trials and research authorities are work speedily
      to target the most proven treatment for the virus so anything is infantile until now. the
      covid-19 with time be more explained by scientists it is steroid response disease and cause
      thromosis and cytokine storm , the aim of the study to inhibit viral replication and decrease
      the severity of the disease as antiviral and anticytokine storm , antithrombosis Zinc is a
      mineral element needed to regulate adaptive immune cells' functions. Higher level of
      intracellular zinc showed to increase intracellular pH; which affect on RNA-dependent RNA
      polymerase and decrease replication mechanism of RNA viruses. Therefore, drugs that described
      as zinc ionophores could be used with zinc supplement to act as antiviral against many RNA
      viruses including SARS-CoV-2 Quercetin is natural compound act as zinc ionophore to cause
      zinc influx intracellular.

      Quercetin is a safe natural anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory polyphenolic compound that
      found in various natural sources include onion, red grapes, honey and citrus fruits. It was
      shown that quercetin has the ability to chelate zinc ions and act as zinc ionophore.
      Therefore, quercetin could have antiviral activity against many RNA viruses . Quercetin, a
      flavonoid found in fruits and vegetables, has unique biological properties that may improve
      mental/physical performance and reduce infection risk ; These properties form the basis for
      potential benefits to overall health and disease resistance, including anti-carcinogenic,
      anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antioxidant, and psychostimulant activities, as well as the
      ability to inhibit lipid peroxidation, platelet aggregation and capillary permeability, and
      to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis .There are various studies that report the
      immunomodulatory effect of bromelain . Bromelain activates natural killer cells and augments
      the production of granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor, IL-2, IL-6 and decreases
      the activation of Thelper cells. Thus, bromelain decreases the majority of inflammatory
      mediators and has demonstrated a significant role as an anti-inflammatory agent in various
      conditions Vitamin C is known as an essential anti-oxidant.,and enzymatic co-factor for
      physiological reactions such as hormone production, collagen synthesis and immune
      potentiation . Naturally, an insufficiency of vitamin C leads to severe injuries to multiple
      organs, especially to the heart and brain, since they are both highly aerobic organs that
      produce more oxygen radicals. In fact, studies of in vivo effect on vitamin C are difficult
      since most animals, except human and some primate, are capable of synthesizing vitamin C
      endogenously
