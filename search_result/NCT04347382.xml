  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness of Nigella Sativa (1 gm seed powder in a capsule orally) and 30
      ml of honey stirred in 250 ml of distilled water 12 hourly till patient becomes asymptomatic
      or a maximum of 14 days with standard hospital care versus standard hospital care alone with
      placebo capsule and 250 ml water, in clearing the COVID-19 nucleic acid from throat and nasal
      swab, lowering disease detrimental effects on HRCT chest/X-ray and severity of symptoms along
      with duration of hospital stay till day 14th day of follow up and 30 days mortality (primary
      outcomes).

      This cohort, adaptive, randomized, double armed group, controlled, Investigator Initiated
      interventional study is designed to demonstrate the superiority of a combination of black
      cumin with honey over standard care in SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infected patients who consent to
      randomization following a new diagnosis in Pakistan with an SSC-2 score of &gt; 5 with positive
      RT-PCR of COVID-19. Investigators will follow up with participants every 4th day to access
      clinically the severity of symptoms along with RT-PCR and HRCT chest or X-ray to access the
      disease progression.Those positive on 8th day will be followed up further for monitoring of
      primary end points. Findings of this trial are expected to help establishing a new remedy for
      the treatment of this pandemic giving mortality benefit along with earlier decrease in viral
      load and lesser complications rate caused by SARS-Cov-2 virus
