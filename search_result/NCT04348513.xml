  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase II, parallel, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled
      trial. The present study will aim to address the efficacy and safety of acute administration
      of triiodothyronine on ICU patients diagnosed with pulmonary infection due to COVID-19 and
      require mechanical respiratory support or ECMO.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It seems that thyroid hormone is critical in the response to body injury and is now
      considered as potential pharmaceutical intervention to limit acute tissue injury. TH (via its
      regulation of stress induced p38 MAPK activation) exerts antiapoptotic action and protects
      tissue from injury, with additional favorable effects on immune system and on viral load in
      infected tissue. This may be a novel and more effective treatment for critically ill viral
      infected patients.

      ThyRepair is the first study which is underway and investigates the safety and efficacy of
      high dose T3 treatment in patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing primary
      angioplasty. The preliminary reports show that this treatment is safe and the efficacy on
      tissue repair is promising. This therapeutic modality could also be tested in the acute
      setting of sepsis in which thyroid hormone is involved in the pathophysiology of multi-organ
      dysfunction. The safety and efficacy of T3 on heamodynamics in sepsis has been previously
      demonstrated in a small trial.

      The present study is phase II, parallel, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo
      controlled trial which aims to investigate the potential effect of T3 intravenous use in the
      recovery of critically ill patients admitted in ICU due to COVID19 infection.

    <description>The primary objective of the study is to determine whether the administration of intravenous triiodothyronine in ICU patients diagnosed with pulmonary infection due to COVID-19 facilitates weaning from cardiorespiratory support compared to placebo. Successful weaning is defined as no requirement for ventilatory support after extubation (mechanical support) or support from ECMO for 48 hours. The primary objective will be measured as percentage of patients successfully weaned after 30 days of follow-up.</description>

The dose administered will be 0.8g/kg i.v. bolus starting within 60min after respiratory support and will be followed by an infusion of 0.113g. kg-1.h-1 i.v. for 48 hours (therapeutic dose). After the first 48h, a maintenance dose will be administered corresponding to 50% of the therapeutic dose (0.057g. kg-1.h-1 i.v.).

Then, the patient for the next 24 hours will receive 21ml of the product (total of 210 Î¼g of T3) that will be diluted in NaCl 0.9% and administered with a pump at a steady flow rate of 10.4 ml/h for a total duration of 48 hours. From day 3 till successful weaning or end of follow-up, the patient will receive 50% of this dose, 10.5 ml of the product (total of 105 Î¼g of T3) that will be diluted in NaCl 0.9% and administered with a pump at a steady flow rate of 5.2 ml/h.</description>
