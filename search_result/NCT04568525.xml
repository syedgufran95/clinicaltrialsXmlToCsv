  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 it as a global pandemic. It becomes clear
      that the virus spreading mostly deadly due to limited to access to diagnostics tests and
      equipment. Traditional radiography and CT remain the main methods of the initial examination
      of the chest organs. Now, most of the diagnostics has been focused on PCR, chest x-Ray/CT
      manifestations of COVID-19. However, there are problems with CT due to infection control
      issues, the inefficiencies introduced in CT room decontamination, and lack of CT availability
      in LMIC (Low Middle Income Countries). Passive microwave radiometry (MWR) is a cheap,
      non-radioactive and portable technology. It has already been used for diagnostics of cancer,
      and other diseases. The investigators have tested if MWR could be used for early diagnostics
      of pulmonary COVID-19 complications.

      This was a randomized controlled trial (195 subjects) to evaluate the effectiveness of
      diagnostics using MWR in patients with pneumonia caused by COVID-19 while they are in
      hospitals of Kyrgyzstan, and healthy individuals.

      The investigator have measured skin (IR) and internal (MWR) temperature by recording passive
      electromagnetic radiation through the chest wall in the projection of the lungs at 30
      symmetrical points on both sides. Pneumonia and lung damage were diagnosed by X-RAY/CT scan
      and doctor's final diagnosis (pn+/pn-). COVID-19 was determined by PCR test (covid+/covid-).

      Overall, the study suggests that the use of MWR is a convenient and safe method for screening
      diagnostics in COVID-19 patients with suspected pneumonia. Since MWR is an inexpensive, it
      will ease the financial burden for both patients and the countries, especially in LMIC

    <description>The MWR2020 (ormer RTM-01-RES) device is a unique commercially available CE marked device. It is registered in UK MHRA MDN 40802 as Microwave thermography system for clinical studies. The device is already registered in Kyrgyzstan for breast cancer diagnostics. During the 1980-90s there were several works on identification of excess of microwave emission due to fluid in lungs (on phantoms) which could be indication of inflammatory, process, cancer and other lung disorders.Later results were confirmed by clinical studies for lung cancer</description>
