  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Novel Coronavirus 2019 Disease (COVID-19) mortality is highly associated with viral pneumonia
      and its complications. Accurate and prompt diagnosis shown to be effective to improve outcome
      by providing early treatment strategies. While chest X-ray (CXR) and computerized tomography
      (CT) are defined as gold standard, given the advantage of being an ionized radiation free,
      practical technique point of care ultrasound (POCUS) is also reported as a diagnostic tool
      for COVID-19. There are limited studies regarding the importance of POCUS in diagnosis and
      review of COVID-19. Therefore the aim of this study is to evaluate the utility of bedside
      lung ultrasound on diagnosis of COVID-19 for patients admitted to emergency department .
