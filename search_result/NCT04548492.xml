  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In late 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified as the causative agent of a
      cluster of pneumonia cases (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China. Clinical symptoms of COVID-19 may be
      mild or severe. The location where a person will self-isolate will be determined by their
      healthcare provider and their health authority. When determining the location, several
      factors to determine the suitability of the home setting are described as the case should
      stay in a room of their own so that they can be isolated from other household members. The
      rapid increase and evolution of modern mobile applications for communication and messaging
      for personal purposes have proved great benefit in healthcare management
