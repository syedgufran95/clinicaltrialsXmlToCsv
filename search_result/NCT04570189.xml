      Auscul-X a touch free digital stethoscope will permit physical distancing of healthcare
      providers while maintaining the ability to auscultate patients from a safe distance (over 10
      feet away)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Auscul-X System (AusculSciences Canada, Inc.), is novel, professional grade, touch free,
      multichannel, touch-free electronic stethoscope with disposable elements designed to protect
      HCPs from exposure to infection diseases by allowing them to auscultate patients from a safe
      distance (10 feet away). The sensors can stay in place and enable providers to listen
      on-demand to a patient's heart and lungs over an extended period of time. This practice of
      distancing in the workplace is a key CDC and PHAC recommendation to protect the frontline HCP
      from exposure risk to the highly contagious COVID- 19 virus and other communicable diseases.
      The Auscul-X not only has the potential to better protect HCPs from infection, but also
      eliminates the potential transmission of pathogens through the use of conventional
      stethoscopes. In addition, the Auscul-X allows multiple HCPs to listen to the patient's heart
      and lung sounds simultaneously

    <time_frame>up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Determine if the quality of the real-time heart and lung sounds (Likert scale) for the Auscul-X will be similar to the conventional stethoscope and digital electronic stethoscope in the ICCU and CSICU (Appendix A).
Determine if the acoustic recordings taken as part of Phase II for the Auscul-X and conventional electronic stethoscope are similar (as evaluated by independent blinded cardiologists and respirologists using a Likert scale for acoustic and diagnostic quality (Appendix B)).
Determine if the acoustic recordings for the Auscul-X and conventional electronic stethoscope provide similar signal quality using objective acoustic metrics (e.g. signal to noise ratios, etc.) (Phase II only)</description>
