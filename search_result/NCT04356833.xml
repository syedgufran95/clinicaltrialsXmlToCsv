    <textblock>
      Some patients infected with COVID-19 require hospitalisation and develop patients a severe
      form of a lung disease called respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In these patients, the
      lungs become severely inflamed because of the virus. The inflammation causes fluid from
      nearby blood vessels to leak into the tiny air sacs in the lungs, making breathing
      increasingly difficult. This fluid forms small clots in the air sacs, creating a barrier
      until the cells regenerate.

      In some patients, this clot does not disappear in a timely fashion or interferes with the
      development of the new cells. Furthermore, the small clots in the air sacs obstruct the air
      and oxygen getting deep into the lungs, interfering with proper ventilation. The trial will
      recruit patients with COVID-19 induced ARDS. Eligible patients (or if patients lack capacity,
      their legal representative) will be provided with an information sheet and informed consent
      will be sought. Eligibility will be mainly assessed via routine clinical assessments.
      Patients will receive a nebulised version of a type of drug called tissue plasminogen
      activator (rt-PA) that is inhaled using a nebuliser. This is normally a drug used to break
      down blood clots. In this situation though, it might be useful for stopping clots forming in
      the lungs, because these might lead to even more difficulties with breathing.

      The first 12 consented patients will receive nebulised rt-PA in addition to standard of care
      (SOC). The second group of 12 patients will receive SOC alone as a comparison. To evaluate
      efficacy, the improvement of oxygen levels over time and safety will be be monitored
      throughout. Blood samples will be taken to measure markers of clotting and inflammation in
      both groups.

      From the end of the treatment phase (after Day 3) both groups will be followed up in
      accordance with SOC.

      This is a phase II, open label, single centre, uncontrolled, repeated dose, pilot trial of
      nebulised rt-PA in patients with COVID-19 ARDS.

      The study will recruit patients requiring either IMV or NIV. Eligible patients (or if
      patients lack capacity, their legal representative) will be provided with an information
      sheet and informed consent will be sought. Eligibility will be assessed via routine clinical
      assessments, which may have been done prior to consent. The only exceptions are a pregnancy
      test (blood or urine), and possibly any assessments that were not done as per routine care.
      These must be done following consent, and all screening assessments must have been done
      during the 24-hour period before dosing with rt-PA.

      The first 12 consented patients will receive nebulised rt-PA in addition to SOC. The second
      group of 12 patients will receive SOC alone as observational arm, to ensure that any changes
      are not entirely due to disease resolution. Within each group 6 patients will be receiving
      IMV and another six will be receiving NIV.

      A statistically powered randomised controlled trial (RCT) would be ideal to define the
      magnitude of benefit and impact on overall survival and is the typical design in patients
      with ARDS. Although there is clinical data on the safety of nebulised rt-PA, but there is no
      clinical data in this clinical condition to facilitate a sample size calculation. There is
      data from a small RCT that has used another fibrinolytic agent, but the doses are not
      comparable. When a patient is randomised to receive no treatment, this precludes
      participation in other interventional studies which might decrease the risk of mortality. The
      most recent figures suggest a 50% mortality in patients receiving IMV there is 50% mortality.
      Currently there is a concerted effort to introduce multiple therapies based on our
      understanding of the pathophysiologic basis of disorder. Further, if this pilot study shows
      significant effect in a subset of patients, there would be justification to progress to a
      statistically powered RCT. In the event of major adverse drug reactions or minor improvement
      in the oxygenation as assessed by PaO2/FiO2 , there are minimal gains to be had with a larger
      randomised control study.

      For patients in the rt-PA group, 10 mg of rt-PA dissolved in 5 ml of diluent will be given
      every 6 hrs for 66 hrs. Dose modifications will not be permitted. Efficacy will be assessed
      by the monitoring of arterial oxygen saturation.

      Safety monitoring will be performed by assessment of the incidence and severity of bleeding
      events, and by the monitoring of plasma fibrinogen levels and routine coagulation parameters.
      Additional samples will be taken for exploratory assessment of potential biomarkers,
      including (but not restricted to) PAI- 1, alpha 2 antiplasmin and a range of inflammatory
      cytokines and coagulation proteins. All other monitoring will be done as per SOC.

      From the end of the treatment phase (after Day 3) both groups will be followed up in
      accordance with SOC.

      Although there is extensive experience with the use of nebulised rt-PA in the context of the
      underlying inflammation, safety measures been included. A gap of 24hrs will be maintained
      between first and second patient. At 24hrs if patient 1 has no evidence of major pulmonary
      bleeding suggesting exaggerated alveolar fibrinolysis and no evidence of fibrinogen reduction
      of more than 50%, suggestive of systemic absorption a second patient will be dosed. Both
      patients will be evaluated for 72 hrs for major pulmonary bleeding and if no bleeding is
      noticed than the rest of the cohort can be recruited after the review of the safety data by
      the trial management group comprised of the investigators. If there are any concerns with the
      data this will be referred to the DMC for review. If the safety profile is acceptable, dosing
      of the third and subsequent patients in the rt-PA group will resume with no required interval
      between patients.

      Efficacy will be described as a relative improvement in PaO2/FiO2 (or SaO2/FiO2) ratio
      assessed at day 5 and day 7 after start of treatment.

      A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be set-up to review safety data within the trial along
      with the final study results and advise on progressing from a pilot study to a randomised
      control trial based on the safety and efficacy data that is collected. The DMC will receive
      weekly reports on bleeding complications, both major and minor along with fibrinogen levels.
      If at any time a patient has major pulmonary bleeding, further dosing of patients will be
      stopped and an adhoc DMC review will be arranged before resuming dosing (see section 12.2
      Data Monitoring Committee).
