  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and pneumonitis often have hypoxemic respiratory
      failure and a need of supplementary oxygen. Guidelines recommend controlled oxygen, for most
      patients with a recommended interval of SpO2 between 92 and 96 %. We aimed to determine if
      closed-loop control of oxygen was feasible in patients with COVID-19 and could maintain SpO2
      in the specified interval.

      Patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and pneumonitis often have hypoxemic respiratory
      failure and a need of supplementary oxygen. Guidelines recommend controlled oxygen, for most
      patients with a recommended interval of SpO2 between 92 and 96 %. We aimed to determine if
      closed-loop control of oxygen was feasible in patients with COVID-19 and could maintain SpO2
      in the specified interval.

      Patients were prospectively enrolled in an observational study on a medical ward dedicated to
      patients with COVID-19. Closed-loop controlled oxygen was delivered by O2matic® which can
      deliver 0-15 liters/min and adjusts flow every second based on 15 seconds averaging of SpO2
      measured by pulse oximetry. Lung function parameters were measured at admission.
