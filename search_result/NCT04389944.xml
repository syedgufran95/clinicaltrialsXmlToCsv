    <textblock>
      This project investigates individual treatments using convalescent severe acute respiratory
      Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) plasma in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients at risk for
      disease progression. In addition to standard of care, SARS-CoV-2 infected patients for whom
      blood group compatible convalescent plasma is available and who are willing to sign the
      informed consent receive convalescent plasma. Only patients with moderate to severe disease
      at risk for transfer to intensive care unit or patients at the intensive care unit with
      limited treatment options will be treated.

    <description>After confirmation of negative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in two consecutive nasal swabs or 28 days after resolution of symptoms, donor check is performed and plasma donation occurs by apheresis. The plasma is photochemically pathogen reduced using the INTERCEPT Blood System.
In addition to standard of care, SARS-CoV-2 infected patients for whom blood group compatible convalescent plasma is available and who are willing to sign the informed consent receive convalescent plasma as follows: 200ml at enrolment and 200ml at 12-24 hours follow-up.</description>
