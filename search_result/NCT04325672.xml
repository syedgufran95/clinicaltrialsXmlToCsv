  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are trying to assess the treatment potential and safety of anti-SARS-CoV-2
      convalescent plasma in patients with acute respiratory symptoms with confirmed COVID-19.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High titer human convalescent plasma will be extracted from apheresis donations from twenty
      recently-sick and currently-recovered COVID-19 patients. An open-label, phase 2A clinical
      trial will then be conducted to administer convalescent plasma to twenty individuals with
      confirmed cases of COVID-19 to investigate the novel application of convalescent plasma in
      the treatment strategy of SARS-CoV-2.
