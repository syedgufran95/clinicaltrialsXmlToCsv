  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan Province, China in December 2019 and rapidly
      spread around the world. To date, the data in the literature regarding the clinical and
      epidemiological characteristics of severe forms of CoVid-19 in patients with chronic
      respiratory disease are not well known.

      The hypothesis is that patients with chronic respiratory disease (COPD, asthma, bronchial
      dilatations, pulmonary hypertension, cystic fibrosis, obesity-hypoventilation syndrome,
      obstructive sleep apnea syndrome) infected with SARS-Cov-2 will have increased dyspnea and
      hypoxemia leading to hospitalization for severe forms more frequently than the general
      population. However, they do not appear to be more at risk of developing a critical form.

      This study is carried out in order to propose to estimate the prevalence of critical forms of
      CoVid19 among patients with chronic respiratory diseases hospitalized for severe forms.
