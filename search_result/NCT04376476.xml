  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The new Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) named coronavirus disease
      2019 (COVID-19) is currently responsible for a pandemic spread of febrile respiratory
      infections, responsible for a veritable global health crisis.

      In adults, several evolutionary patterns are observed: i) a/pauci-symptomatic forms; ii)
      severe forms immediately linked to rare extensive viral pneumonia; and iii) forms of moderate
      severity, some of which progress to secondary aggravation (Day 7-Day 10). Children can be
      affected, but are more rarely symptomatic and severe pediatric forms are exceptional.

      Like some other coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus
      (MERS-CoV)), these differences in clinical expression could be based on a variability in the
      immunological response, notably either via inhibition of the type I interferon (IFN-I)
      response, or on the contrary an immunological dysregulation responsible for a &quot;cytokine
      storm&quot; associated with the aggravation. Little is known about the impact of these innate
      immune response abnormalities on the adaptive response. In addition, certain genetic factors
      predisposing to a state of &quot;hyper-fragility&quot; and certain viral virulence factors could also
      be predictive of the clinical response.

      In this context, the main hypothesis is that the virological analysis and the initial
      biological and immunological profiles are correlated with the initial clinical presentation
      of COVID-19 infection. In particular, children forms and pauci-symptomatic disease in adults
      may be linked to a more robust innate immune response, including better production of IFN-I.
