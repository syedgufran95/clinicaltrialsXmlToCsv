  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research proposes to study a large healthy population active for the presence of
      antibodies directed against the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
      virus and this over time.

      After verification of the inclusion criteria and information by the coordinating
      investigative doctor, the volunteers sign a written consent. A nurse will take blood samples
      under safe conditions compatible with the pandemic period and while respecting the protection
      of the volunteer's personal data.

      The blood samples will be taken at 3 times: T0 (day of inclusion), between 6 weeks and 3
      months and 6 months' post-inclusion.

      Each blood sample consists of a collection of 5 mL of blood in a dry tube. The serum samples
      will be extracted and collected prospectively from the blood samples. A questionnaire will be
      completed by the inclusion volunteer (T0) in the study then 1, between 6 weeks and 3 months
      and 6 months' post-inclusion.

      The nasopharyngeal swabs will be performed at 2 times: between 6 weeks and 3 months and 6
      months post-inclusion for Institut Curie staff who have had at least one of the following
      three criteria on the sample or questionnaire carried out at T0:

        -  have had RT-PCR+

        -  and/or presence of antibodies at the 95% threshold

        -  and/or anosmia/ageusia

        -  and/or digestive syndrome with associated respiratory signs. In case of infection
           between sampling times, if the volunteer meets one of the three criteria above, a
           nasopharyngeal swab will be performed during the following visits.

      The nasopharyngeal swab shall also be proposed to volunteers not meeting the 4 above listed
      criteria in order to have a control group (about 100 volunteers) for future statistical
      analyses.

      If the volunteers accept, naso-pharyngeal swab shall be performed between 6 weeks and 3
      months and 6 months after inclusion.

      The nasopharyngeal swabs will be performed at 3 times for Institute Pasteur personnel: at T0
      (inclusion day), between 6 weeks and 3 months, and 6 months post-inclusion
