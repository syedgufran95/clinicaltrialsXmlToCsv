  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Context: On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the current corona virus
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak as a pandemic. The first laboratory-confirmed case of
      COVID-19 in Austria was announced on February 27, 2020. Since then, the incidence of
      infection follows a gradual increase. Measurements taken by the Austrian government include
      travel restrictions, closing of national borders, social distancing, a mandatory use of
      facemasks in public, and closing of stores and restaurants. The underlying aim of those
      imposed restrictions is to contain the viral transmission and to slow spreading of the severe
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

      Objectives: The aims of this study are to determine i) how many employees in Austrian trauma
      hospitals and rehabilitation facilities have virus specific IgG and IgM antibodies against
      SARS-CoV-2, ii) how many are active virus carriers (symptomatic and asymptomatic), iii) how
      many employees are in their incubation period during the study period, and iv) to calculate
      the SARS-CoV-2 prevalence together with a specific occupation associated infection risk
      within the different specifications of health care workers.

      Study Design: Open uncontrolled observational cross-sectional study.

      Setting/Participants: A total of 4000 employees in 11 Austrian trauma hospitals and
      rehabilitation facilities of the Austrian Social Insurance for Occupational Risks (AUVA) will
      be invited to participate in the study.

      Study Interventions and Measures: An antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgM
      antibodies, and a RT-PCR test based on oropharyngeal swab samples, as well as
      laboratory-based antibody tests using ELISA, will be implemented to ensure protection and
      preservation of health in hospital staff and are not part of the study. The tests will be
      conducted twice, with approximately two weeks in between testing. The results of the tests
      will be used for statistical analysis in this study together with a questionnaire including
      questions related to personal health, traveling activities, living situation, as well as
      inquiries of symptoms and comorbidities.
