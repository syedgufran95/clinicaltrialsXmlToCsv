      This exploratory study is a randomized, single center, open label study of four different
      experimental treatment arms versus standard of care for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection
      in symptomatic outpatients with mild disease at the time of enrollment.

    <textblock>
      This phase 2, exploratory study will be an adaptive, randomized, open label, trial for
      treatment of individuals in an outpatient settings with mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. The
      primary outcome is focused on the evaluation of efficacy of the proposed experimental drugs
      in reducing upper respiratory viral shedding, defined as viral clearance (i.e., negative
      swab) on Day 7. Key secondary outcomes focus on other measures of viral shedding, safety
      evaluation, progression to LRTI (defined by resting blood oxygen saturation level [SpO2] &lt;93%
      sustained for two readings two hours apart and presence of subjective dyspnoea or cough),
      disease severity, clinical resolution rate, and cumulative incidence of hospitalization or
      mortality at Day 28.

         14. Currently on treatment with drugs with known arrhythmogenic potential, or those known
             to induce significant QT-interval prolongation or TdP, as detailed in Appendix 6.

         15. Currently on treatment for tuberculosis (or on treatment with rifampicin for any other
             indication), or on treatment with a protease inhibitor-based antiretroviral regimen,
             or efavirenz, or carbamazepine.

         16. Inability/unlikely to be in the study area for the duration of the 28 day follow-up

         17. Any surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs, or which may jeopardize the safety of
             the volunteer or the objectives of the study. The Investigator should make this
             determination in consideration of the volunteer's medical history.

             conduct of the study.

         19. Participant is judged by the Investigator to be at significant risk of failing to
