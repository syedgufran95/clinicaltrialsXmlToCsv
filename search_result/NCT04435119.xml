  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      First epidemiological data about COVID-19 pandemic confirm that older adults are likely to
      experience severe and lethal forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in particular frail elderly
      living in nursing-homes. Vitamin D could be a biological determinant of COVID-19, as
      indicated by genomic-guided tracing of SARS-CoV-2 targets in human cells. Epidemiological
      observational data are necessary for better understanding the links between vitamin D
      supplementation and COVID-19 outcomes, in particular in nursing-homes (in which the risk of
      hypovitaminosis D is very high).

      The investigators had the opportunity to use information collected in a French middle-sized
      nursing-home affected by COVID-19 in March-April 2020, to determine whether recent vitamin D3
      supplementation was associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 in residents infected with
      SARS-CoV-2. As recommended in French nursing-homes, all residents are systematically and
      regularly supplemented with bolus vitamin D3 (every single, 2 or 3 months, depending on
      residents).

      The main objective of this study is to determine whether bolus vitamin D3 supplementation
      taken during or in the month before COVID-19 was effective in improving survival among frail
      elderly nursing-home residents infected with COVID-19 compared to those having received
      supplementation longer ago.

      The secondary objective is to determine whether bolus vitamin D3 supplementation taken during
      or in the month before COVID-19 was effective in limiting the clinical severity of the
      infection according to the World Health Organization's Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement
      (OSCI) for COVID-19 compared to those having received supplementation longer ago.

      Retrospective observational unicentric study in nursing-home residents with COVID-19. Health
      status monitoring data available until May 15, 2020. For all participants, gender, age,
      disability, history and comorbidities, treatments, date of last vitamin D3 supplementation,
      results of last blood test, date of suspicion / diagnosis of COVID-19, COVID-19 OSCI score,
      and eventual hospitalization or death (surveillance data available until May 15, 2020) are
      collected.
