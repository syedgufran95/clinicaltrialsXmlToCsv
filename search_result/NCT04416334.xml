  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3 clinical trial, randomized, single-center, opened, controlled, to evaluate
      efficacy and safety of early administration of colchicines in patients older than 70 years,
      with high risk of pulmonary complications due to coronavirus SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19). An
      approximately number of 1000 subjects meeting all inclusion and none exclusion criteria will
      be randomized either to receive colchicines or symptomatic treatment with paracetamol during
      21 days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether short term course of colchicines
      reduces number of deaths due to COVID-19 and severe complications due to the virus in elderly
      patients with comorbidities.

      The secondary objective is to determine the safety of colchicines in this patient population.

      Approximately 1000 subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none exclusion criteria will
      be randomized either to receive colchicines or symptomatic treatment (1:1 allocation ratio)
      during 21 days. Follow-up assessments will occur every 48 hours and always at day 7, 15 and
      21 following randomization for evaluation of the occurrence of any trial endpoints or other
      adverse events.
