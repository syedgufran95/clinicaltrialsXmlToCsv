  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the limitations of COVID-19 treatment and in the absence of licensed antiviral for
      COVID-19, the historical choice of therapeutic convalescent plasma (CP) is considered
      especially against RNA viruses .It was known that convalescent plasma does not only
      neutralize the pathogens but provide passive immunomodulatory properties that allows the
      recipient to control the exaggerated inflammatory cascade. However, still there is a lack of
      understanding of the mechanism of action of CCP therapeutic components. Reports from open
      label trials and case series show that CCP is safe and might be effective in severe cases
      with COVID-19 . Therefore, the World health organisation (WHO) and Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) issued guidelines for the CCP usage and standardised the donor selection
      , which was further supported by Emergency use Authorisation (EUA) .

      Therefore, the aim in the current study is to assess the effect of CCP on time to clinical
      improvement, hospital mortality and to evaluate the changes on oxygen saturation and
      laboratory markers (lymphocyte counts and C-reactive protein) compared with standard
      treatment alone in patients with moderate or severe COVID-19 disease.

    <description>Time to clinical improvement is defined as a time frame from CCP administration till 30 days or discharge, defined as a 2-grade decrease on an ordinal WHO clinical scale . The WHO clinical scale based on the following 7-grade ordinal levels: 1= ambulatory, independent; 2= ambulatory with assistance; 3=hospitalised, not requiring supplemental oxygen; 4= hospitalised, requiring supplemental oxygen; 5= hospitalised, requiring nasal high-flow oxygen therapy, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, or both; 6= hospitalised, requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, invasive mechanical ventilation, or both; and 7= death.</description>

Valid consent.
Request the CCP from the central blood bank (200-250 ml/dose - can be repeated again in 12 hours) this is through the local hospital blood bank.
How to transfuse CCP:
Dose required is 200-250 ml/hr (one dose, can be repeated in 12 hrs), max total 500ml.
Premedication prior to administration of CCP (Acetaminophen, diphenhydramine,steriods) or according to hospital guidelines.</description>

    <description>The source convalescent plasma is typically collected from individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 which contains antibodies titer against SARS-CoV-2 and is administered to patients with COVID-19. Donor eligibility criteria and qualification are based on American Accredited Blood Banks ( AABB) standards , including questionnaires and relevant transfusion-transmitted infections testing are performed. Furthermore, pathogen inactivation will be performed for each unit, CCP was only collected from individuals who meet all donor eligibility requirements (21 CFR 630.10 and 21 CFR 630.15). Donors must be found positive at a diagnostic test of nasopharyngeal swab at the time of illness and positive serological test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after recovery. All donors should have negative HLA antibodies.</description>
