      This is a multicenter, multinational observational cohort study to document neurologic
      manifestations of COVID 19 among pediatric patients requiring hospital admission for
      confirmed or suspected COVID 19 (Coronavirus 19 disease, caused by infection with the
      SARS-CoV-2 (acute respiratory syndrome 2 ) virus. SARS-CoV2 shares significant structural and
      biological similarities with SARS-CoV including using the ACE-2 receptor as a docking site, a
      property that confers neurotropism.

      This study is sponsored and led by members of the Pediatric Neurocritical Care Research Group
      (PNCRG).

    <textblock>
      Early reports of COVID-19 indicate that adults experience a variety of neurological symptoms
      and diagnoses in approximately 36% of patients, including headaches, seizures, coma,
      encephalitis, and cerebrovascular events including ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage,
      and cerebral venous sinus thromboses. In children, recent evidence highlights acute and
      long-term neurological manifestations due to other viral illnesses including Guillain Barre
      syndrome and neonatal microcephaly with Zika virus, encephalitis with H1N1 influenza, and
      acute flaccid paralysis with enterovirus-68. However, COVID-19 reports in children published
      thus far lack detailed information on the frequency and outcomes of neurological findings.

      COVID-19 cases are rapidly rising internationally, with experts forecasting subsequent global
      surges and continued activity. Thus, it is imperative to accurately document prevalence and
      outcomes of the neurological aspects of COVID-19 specifically in children. Such data will
      serve to alert clinicians and families about the possibility that children may present with
      neurologic rather than &quot;classic&quot; symptoms of COVID-19 who nevertheless would warrant testing,
      and that neurologic events can occur subsequent to the diagnosis that may impact long-term
      outcomes (e.g., cognitive, emotional, physical health). The investigators anticipate that
      improved knowledge about neurologic manifestations in children will bolster personalized
      treatment and rehabilitation strategies to optimize child outcomes and inform future
      interventional studies.
