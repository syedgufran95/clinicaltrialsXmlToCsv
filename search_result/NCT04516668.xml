    <textblock>
      The pandemic of COVID-19 (coronavirus desease 19) led to a strict quarantine from 15 March
      2020 to 11 May 2020. Maternal depression is a current pathology , especially in the
      post-partum (more than 15%). The quarantine could lead to anxious and/or depressive symptoms
      and difficulties in parents-children bonding.

      Women who have experenced post-partum period have more chance to developp subsequent
      depression.

      Among women who have experienced post-partum depression, those who were able to benefit from
      psychiatric follow-up during the quarantine by tele-consultation have a lower risk of anxious
      and depressive symptoms than those who did not receive follow-up.
