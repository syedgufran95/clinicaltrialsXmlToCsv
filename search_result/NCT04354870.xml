      Off label study to evaluate the efficacy of HCQ for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to
      prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. 350
      participants will be assigned to the group that takes HCQ or the group that opts to not take
      the study medication. Participants will be NYULH HCW at high risk for occupational exposure
      to SARS-CoV-2. Study timepoints will include screening/enrollment, 30 day, 60 day, and 90 day
      visits. Questionnaires, and DBS will be collected in all timepoints.

    <textblock>
      Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is licensed for the chemoprophylaxis and treatment of malaria and as
      a disease modifying antirheumatic drug. It has a long history of being safe and well
      tolerated at typical doses. HCQ has antiviral activity in vitro against coronaviruses, and
      specifically Covid-19. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine
      (HCQ) for pre exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among health care workers at high risk of occupational
      exposure to SARS-CoV-2 compared to the eligible cohort that declines treatment.
