    <textblock>
      This study seeks to investigate the role of lung ultrasound in caring for Covid-19 positive
      patients and whether it can be used to predict patient deterioration. This information will
      be vital for healthcare workers who seek to identify Covid-19 pneumonia or patients at risk
      for deterioration early in the disease course.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As Covid-19 continues to stress hospital-based resources (including personal protective
      equipment, ancillary staff availability, and imaging study utilization), it is important to
      assess whether alternative methods for evaluating patients can be utilized to appropriately
      triage and care for Covid-positive patients. Current limitations of caring for patients with
      Covid-19 include the exposure of ancillary healthcare workers (including radiological
      technicians) and the time/resources required to decontaminate traditional radiological
      equipment such as x-ray or computerized tomography (CT) machines.

      Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has the potential to transform healthcare delivery due to
      its diagnostic and therapeutic expediency. It can be quickly performed at the bedside by
      experienced clinicians. It it has been shown to reliably and accurately diagnose patients
      with a variety of lung diseases, including pneumonia. This study seeks to investigate the
      role of lung ultrasound in caring for Covid-19 positive patients and whether it can be used
      to predict patient deterioration. This information will be vital for healthcare workers who
      seek to identify the virus or patients at risk for deterioration early in the disease course.
      Moreover, it has the potential to reduce the need for x-rays or CTs for Covid-19 patients,
      which has the potential to alleviate a significant burden currently being placed on the
      healthcare system.
