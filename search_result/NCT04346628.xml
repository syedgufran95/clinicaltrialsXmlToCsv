      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of oral favipiravir plus standard of
      care treatment (SOC) compared with placebo plus SOC in reducing the duration of shedding of
      SARS-CoV2 virus in patients with mild or asymptomatic COVID-19.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of COVID-19 disease:

               -  If symptomatic, presence of mild to moderate symptoms without signs of
                  respiratory distress, with positive for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assay within 72
                  hours prior to.informed consent.

               -  If asymptomatic, initial diagnosis obtained no more than 72 hours prior to
                  informed consent

             incapable of fathering a child, OR, if of childbearing potential will strictly adhere

             of study medication

             Subjects on empirical antibiotic treatment for possible but unproven bacterial
             pneumonia, but who are positive for SARS-CoV-2, are allowed in the study (will be
             randomized to the same treatment to maintain blinding).

          -  History of abnormal uric acid metabolism.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to an anti-viral nucleoside-analog drug targeting a viral
             RNA polymerase.

          -  Use of adrenocorticosteroids (except topical or inhaled preparations or oral
             preparations equivalent to or less than 10 mg of oral prednisone) or immunosuppressive
             or immunomodulatory drugs (e.g., immunosuppressants, anticancer drugs, interleukins,
             interleukin antagonists or interleukin receptor blockers). NOTE: Treatment of study
             participants following institutional COVID-19 treatment policies or guidelines,
             including the use of immunomodulatory medications, is permitted. This excludes
             treatment with agents that have the potential for direct antiviral activity, including
             convalescent plasma and NO, and co-enrollment into other clinical studies that
             evaluate investigational agents for COVID-19.

          -  Serious chronic disease (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], cancer requiring
             chemotherapy within the preceding 6 months, and/or moderate or severe hepatic
             insufficiency).

          -  Previously received favipiravir within the past 30 days.

          -  Advanced kidney disease

          -  Advanced liver disease

          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse in the previous two years.

          -  Psychiatric illness that is not well controlled (defined as stable on a regimen for
             more than one year).

          -  Taken another investigational drug within the past 30 days.

          -  Seemed by the Investigator to be ineligible for any reason.
