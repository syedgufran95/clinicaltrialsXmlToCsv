      Experimental Use of Convalescent Plasma of Passive Immunisation In Current COVID-19 Pandemic
      in Pakistan in 2020 Rationale &amp; Objective: This study would help to gather real-life setting
      clinical data in local population, ultimately leading to increased evidence based management
      of the disease condition in the said population.

      Eligibility:

        1. informed consent must have been obtained

        2. confirmed COVID-19 cases confirmed by RT-PCR laboratory tests

        3. moderately severe or severe life-threatening COVID-19 related features: a) Moderately
           Severe disease as defined by the following features: i) Shortness of breath, ii)
           respiratory rate ≥ 30/min, iii) arterial blood oxygen saturation ≤ 92%, iv) and/or lung
           infiltrates &gt; 25% within 24 to 48 hours 67 b) Severe Life-threatening disease as defined
           by: i) respiratory failure, ii) shock, and/or § multiple organ dysfunction

           Exclusion Criteria:

           Allergy history of plasma, sodium citrate and methylene blue; 2. For patients with
           history of autoimmune system diseases or selective IgA deficiency, 3. the application of
           convalescent plasma should be evaluated cautiously by clinicians.

        4. Patients having evidence of uncontrolled cytokine release syndrome leading to end-stage
           multiorgan failure.

      Methodology:

      Total sample size is n=2000. A case report form (CRF) will have to be generated for each
      corona virus patient at baseline and the completion of study endpoint (at the time of
      discharge and at 4 weeks after experimental treatment modality using convalescent plasma.

        -  A unique identification number will be issued for each patient in this protocol.

        -  This data will be recorded in the national database. Data sources &amp; Analysis: Patient
           data originating from patient medical record and assessments (mentioned in table below)
           will be recorded in the study CRF. Safety data (AEs and SAEs) from any time point during
           the study will be recorded in the study CRF. All analyses will be performed by third
           party statistician on SPSS. For continuous variables, summary statistics included n
           (number of observations), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values,
           as well as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables will be presented.

    <textblock>
      Passive immunization involves the administration of antibodies against a given agent to a
      susceptible individual for the purpose of preventing or treating an infectious disease due to
      that agent. A general principle of passive antibody therapy is that it is more effective when
      used for prophylaxis than for treatment of disease. When used for therapy, antibody is most
      effective when administered shortly after the onset of symptoms. The reason for temporal
      variation in efficacy is not well understood but could reflect that passive antibody works by
      neutralizing the initial inoculums, which is likely to be much smaller than that of
      established disease. As an example, passive antibody therapy for pneumococcal pneumonia was
      most effective when administered shortly after the onset of symptoms, and there was no
      benefit if antibody administration was delayed past the third day of disease.

      The therapeutic benefits of convalescent plasma were formally studied in animal models in
      early 20th century. It efficacy was first determined in 1916, when 26 poliomyelitis patients
      were treated with convalescent plasma from polio survivors. Subsequently, therapeutic and
      prophylactic significance was explored in influenza and measles. Transfusion of immune plasma
      is a standard treatment modality for various viral hemorrhagic fevers. Its efficacy in
      treating Ebola Virus Disease is also well established. Studies have reported reduction viral
      load in patients with H1N1 influenza. Of special attention is the meta-analysis, carried out
      by Mair-Jenkinset al, concluding effectiveness of passive immunization as a treatment option
      for severe viral acute respiratory infections caused by SARS corona virus, influenza A
      (H1N1), avian influenza A (H5N1) and Spanish influenza A. Efficacy of convalescent plasma has
      been anecdotally reported in SARS-CoV-2 infections.
