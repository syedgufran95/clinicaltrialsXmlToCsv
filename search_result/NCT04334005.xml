  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The new outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is causing an important pandemic affecting a
      large number of people all-over the world. Vitamin D is a hormone precursor produced by our
      own body with the help of sunlight which has an important role on adaptive immunity and
      cellular differentiation, maturation and proliferation of several immune cells. Reduced
      levels of vitamin D in calves were positioned as the main cause of bovine coronavirus
      infection in the past. Therefore, it seems plausible that the use of vitamin D as a
      nutritional ergogenic aid could be a potential intervention to fight against COVID-19
      infected patients which remain asymptomatic or which have non-severe and severe symptoms.
      This study aims to investigate whether the use of vitamin D as an immune modulator agent
      induces significant improvements of health status and outcomes in non-severe symptomatic
      patients infected with COVID-19 as well as preventing COVID-19 health deterioration. We
      hypothesize that vitamin D will significantly improve hard endpoints related to COVID-19
      deleterious consequences compared with a usual care control group.
