    <textblock>
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) poses substantial challenges for
      health care systems. With a vastly expanding amount of publications on COVID-19, clinicians
      need evidence synthesis to produce guidance for handling patients with COVID-19.

      . Conavirus belongs to the subfamily of Ortho-coronavirinae in the family of Coronaviridae
      and the Order Nidovirales. In 2003, a SARS-CoV had caused the out- break of severe acute
      respiratory syndrome. In December 2019, an &quot;unknown viral pneumonia&quot; out- break has been
      reported. Finally, a novel coronavirus was detected, isolated virus was termed as SARS-CoV2,
      characterized as highly contagious and deadly. By the end of February 2020, more than 78,631
      cases infected with SARS-CoV-2, and more than 2747 deaths were confrmed in China, and the
      COVID-19 has been declared a pan- demic by World Health Organization. For those infected by
      SARS-CoV-2, some of the patients didnot show hypoxemia or respiratory stress during the
      course of COVID-19, indicating a multifaceted disease of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, one
      reliable and convenient biomarker is needed to predict the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia.
      Recently, several studies have reported that C-reactive protein (CRP) is positively
      asso-ciated with severe dengue infection, and patients with higher plasma CRP in the initial
      period of dengue, are at higher risk to develop plasma leakage. We examined which routine
      laboratory tests are associated with severe COVID-19 disease, and the relation between the
      laboratory results and the security of COVID19 diasease, in two of large Upper Egypt medical
      centers, which are Aswan University and assiut university hospitals.
