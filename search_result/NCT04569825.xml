    <textblock>
      Background: Anosmia is a debilitating common symptom of COVID-19. The therapeutic effect of
      systemic steroid for the treatment of anosmia has been studied with various findings of its
      efficacy. However, the effect of local steroid was not assessed before.

      Objective: To estimate the efficacy of local steroid in the treatment of anosmia in COVID-19
      patients.

      Background: Anosmia is a debilitating common symptom of COVID-19. The therapeutic effect of
      systemic steroid for the treatment of anosmia has been studied with various findings of its
      efficacy. However, the effect of local steroid was not assessed before.

      Objective: To estimate the efficacy of local steroid in the treatment of anosmia in COVID-19
      patients.

      Materials and Methods: A double-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted at
      Al-Ramadi Teaching Hospital and Tikrit Teaching Hospital during the period from 23th August
      to 30th September. Proven cases by real-time polymerase chain reaction and presented with
      anosmia alone or with ageusia were enrolled in the study. The patients divided into 4 groups
      according to the treatment modalities. Group A (local steroid nasal drops), group B (local
      normal saline nasal drops), group C (systemic and local steroid), and group D (systemic
      steroid and local normal saline). Comparison between the groups concerning the fate and the
      recovery time of the anosmia was analyzed.

      Results and Conclusion: Depends on the finding of the studied patients.
