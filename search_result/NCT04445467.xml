  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised placebo controlled phase II trial to examine the efficacy of antivirals
      to treat COVID-19 infection compared to placebo for virological cure and improved clinical
      outcomes. Individuals will be randomised to the candidate antiviral which in the first
      instance is Favipiravir or matched placebo and randomisation will be stratified according to
      whether the participant requires hospitalisation or not. This treatment will be given in
      addition to the usual standard of care in the participating hospital.
