    <textblock>
      Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of NTX in adult patients (≥18 years and &lt;60 years),
      with SARS-CoV-2 infection with mild symptoms of COVID-19, compared to a placebo control arm.
      135 patients will be randomized to either Nitazoxanide (n=90) or placebo (n=45) (2:1). Simple
      blind design. Primary endpoint: eradication of virus from patients' respiratory tract
      secretions by the 7th day of treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rapid spread of COVID-19 has overwhelmed the capabilities of the Public Health System in
      major nations due to the large number of critically ill patients and patients seriously
      affected requiring intensive care.

      Reducing the viral load, along with other epidemiological measures, including social
      isolation and quarantine, may in the long run significantly reduce the R0 (Basic Reproductive
      Rhythm) of infection.

      To date, in our country there are no specific antiviral treatments approved by the regulatory
      authorities for COVID-19, and no vaccines so far exist. Symptomatic and supportive treatment
      has been the main intervention for patients with moderate to severe infection.

      The lack of a drug with a demonstrated solid antiviral efficacy warrants the need to explore
      new therapeutic options against SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19.

      Nitazoxanide is a widely used thiazolide, approved by the FDA and ANMAT (Argentine drug
      regulatory authority) as an antiprotozoal, with a very good safety record for a variety of
      indications. NTX was shown to have extensive antiviral activity against, inter alia, animal
      and human coronaviruses. Indeed, it exhibits in vitro activity against MERS-CoV and other
      coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, where it inhibits the expression of viral protein N.
      Another proposed antiviral mechanism for Nitazoxanide involves PKR and eIF2α phosphorylation
      and the depletion of ATP-sensitive intracellular calcium deposits in infected cells, thereby
      inducing chronic sub-lethal stress of the endoplasmic reticulum and impairing the
      glycosylation of the structural protein.

      Exposure in clinical trials included a specific experience on patients with uncomplicated
      influenza-like illness, where the drug helped reduce the mean time for symptom relief.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NTX (1,000mg/3 times
      per day plus standard treatment for 14 days in male and female patients (≥ 18 years and &lt;60
      years) with COVID-19 infection, with mild symptoms, as compared to a control group treated
      with placebo. The proposed study dose regime of Nitazoxanide 1,000 mg/3 times per day (every
      8 hours) for 14 days may be modified if patients experience considerable GI adverse effects.
      In these cases, the dose may be lowered to one (1) 500 mg tablet every 6 hours (2,000 mg
      /day). Nitazoxanide has been also administered in other studies up to 4 g daily without
      significant adverse effects or changes in ECG or other laboratory values.

      The proposed treatment regimen is expected to reduce disease severity by earlier eradication
      of viral load in NTX-treated patients when compared to placebo-treated patients, thus
      preventing the dysregulation of the innate immune system caused by the viral infection and
      modifying the high mortality in older/vulnerable populations. Early virus negativization or
      viral load reduction can potentially reduce the severity of the symptoms, eventually
      preventing a liable collapse of the Health Care System and ensuring a more controlled
      response to the disease.

      Because of its known antiviral and safety profiles, and the fact that it can be orally
      administered to both adults and children, as well as its rapid availability and
      affordability, Nitazoxanide appears as an interesting alternative for such a situation.

      Statistical analysis: 1-tailed statistical test, with a 25% α value (or type I error) (p
      value &lt;0.025) and a power (type II error, or β value) of 0.20 (power of 80%) for superiority
      of the intervention arm over the control arm. All statistical analyzes will be carried out
      using STATA, version 14.0.

    <measure>Eradication of SARS COV-2 from patients' respiratory tract secretions by treatment day 7th.</measure>
    <time_frame>7 day</time_frame>
    <description>Erradication will be considered a reduction of the viral load on day 7 greater than 35% with respect to placebo. Extraction of genomic material will be performed using a QIAgen mini kit (QIAmp viral RNA) validated by the CDC (United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download) (CDC-006-00019) Viral load will be quantified with the following detection kits: Commercial Kit: PCR-EUA-CDC-nCoV-IFU. Commercial KIT SENTINEL - STAT-NAT Covid 19B (Berlín).
Rational: In mild cases of COVID-19, 50% of the patients eradicated the virus within a period of 3 weeks, 25% eradicated the virus before the 13th day, 75% during the first month and the rest were &quot; late eradicators.&quot; This latter subgroup of patients has been associated with severe cases of COVID-19 disease.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparative decrease of the viral load</measure>
    <time_frame>3 - 35 days</time_frame>
    <description>Consequently, in mild cases, viral eradication will likely occur more frequently during the first to second week of COVID-19 disease; less than 15% could eradicate the virus during the first week of symptom onset. From an epidemiological point of view, increasing the viral eradication rate from less than 15% to more than 35% during the first two weeks of treatment would be clinically relevant.(seven), 14 (fourteen) and 35 (thirty-five) after starting treatment compared to the baseline measurement.</description>
