  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blinded, placebo-controlled parallel, phase II clinical efficacy study
      evaluating Nitric Oxide Nasal Irrigation (NONI) for the treatment of COVID-19 in individuals
      with mild COVID-19 Infection.

    <textblock>
      Up to 50 subjects will be enrolled into one of two cohorts of this study in a ratio of 1:1
      (Treatment: Placebo Control). Subjects will be screened and randomized into one of two
      parallel cohorts.

        -  Treatment (N = up to 25): Subjects will be enrolled and receive daily NONI treatment for
           14 days with a follow-up visit on Day 28 post randomization.

        -  Placebo (N = up to 25): Subjects will be enrolled and receive a placebo for 14 days with
           a follow-up visit on Day 28 post randomization.
