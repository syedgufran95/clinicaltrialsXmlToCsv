    <textblock>
      Since December 2019, there has been an outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in China. As
      of February 18, 2020, 72,530 cases confirmed with 2019 coronavirus disease(COVID-19) have
      been reported and 1,870 deaths were declared. Until now, cases of COVID-19 have been reported
      in 26 countries. This observational study aims to analysis the clinical features of neonates
      with COVID-19 and the neonates born to mother with COVID-19.

      Given that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads rapidly and
      is contagious to the general population, all the suspected or confirmed newborns will be
      admitted to the neonatal departments in designated hospitals of China. In this study, the
      diagnosis of neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection is based on the criterion provided by National
      Health Commission and the Chinese perinatal-neonatal SARS-CoV-2 Committee. All samples will
      be treated as biohazardous material. SARS-CoV-2 will be tested in blood, cord blood, amniotic
      fluid, placenta, respiratory tract, stool, urine from mothers or neonates. The medical
      information questionnaires are classified into maternal and neonatal version, which include
      demographic details, epidemical history, clinical manifestations, tests collected time and
      results, imaging performed time and results and therapeutic data. Two researchers
      independently checked and recorded the data to ensure the accuracy of the data.

    <time_frame>Infants ( ≥35 weeks）are at 6 months after birth;Infants（&lt; 35weeks） are at a corrected age of 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The standardized DDST consists of 104 items and covers four areas of development: (a) personal/social, (b) fine motor/adaptive, (c) language, and (d) gross motor. In the present study, three trained professionals examined the children. The results of the DDST could be normal (no delays), suspect (2 or more caution items and/or 1 or more delays), abnormal (2 or more delays) or untestable (refusal of one or more items completely to the left of the age line or more than one item intersected by the age line in the 75-90% area). The children with suspect or abnormal results were retested 2 or 3 weeks later.</description>
