  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The search for novel therapies to address the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is
      ongoing. No proven therapies have been identified to prevent progression of the virus.
      Preliminary data suggest that inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) could have benefit in preventing
      viral progression and reducing reliance on supplemental oxygen and ventilator support.

      Expanded access allows for iNO to be delivered via the portable INOpulse delivery system for
      the treatment of COVID-19.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NO is a naturally produced molecule that is critical to the immune response to defend against
      pathogens and infections. In vitro studies have shown that NO inhibits the replication of
      severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and improves survival for
      cells infected with SARS-CoV. Additionally, in a clinical study of patients infected with
      SARS-CoV, iNO demonstrated improvements in arterial oxygenation, a reduction in ventilation
      support and an improvement in lung infiltrates observed on chest radiography. Based on the
      genetic similarities between the two coronaviruses, the data in SARS-CoV support the
      potential for iNO to provide meaningful benefit for patients infected with COVID-19.

      The clinical spectrum of the COVID-19 infection ranges from mild signs of upper respiratory
      tract infection to severe pneumonia and death. Preventing disease progression in patients
      with mild or moderate disease would improve morbidity/mortality and significantly reduce the
      impact on limited healthcare resources.

      Expanded access allows for iNO to be delivered via the INOpulse delivery system for the
      treatment of COVID-19. INOpulse technology provides targeted pulsatile delivery of iNO via
      portable INOpulse delivery system.
