    <description>For each patient included in the study, the secondary variables will be noted in the patient's data collection logbook.
This is followed by radial artery cannulation (if absent), and connection to the HemoSphere/EV1000 platform
After the daily visit, the PI/collaborating investigators (CI) will measure the clinical, treatment, and mechanical ventilation parameters of the patient during the last 24 hours.
Daily arterial analysis will be requested
This information collection process will be followed for 5 days. At the end of the information collection period, the IP will perform two downloads, the engineering download, and the standard download in which the values are monitored every 20 seconds.
These will be noted in the secondary variables of the data collection logbook, along with the patients' ICU discharge date.
In-hospital mortality will be monitored during admission to a conventional hospital ward.
Records will be closed upon discharge of the patient.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients over 18 years old.

          -  Patients that are classified as a &quot;confirmed case&quot; according to criteria established
             by the Spanish Ministry of Health in its Technical Document updated on March 31, 2020.
             This defines a &quot;confirmed case&quot; as a case that meets laboratory criteria (Positive PCR
             test for any of the SARS-CoV-2 genes).

          -  Patients admitted to ICU.

          -  Presence of Kirby index (PaFi) less than or equal to 300 mm Hg, with PEEP or CPAP
             greater than or equal to 5 cmH2O.

          -  Need for radial artery cannulation for hemodynamic monitoring and/or repeated
             monitoring of blood gases at the discretion of the responsible physician.

          -  Patients who agree (or a representative of the patient if sedated) to participate in
             study and who provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients being treated with veno-venous or veno-arterial ECMO

          -  Patient with therapeutic restrictions due to life support

          -  Patient who presents a complication that requires surgical intervention.
