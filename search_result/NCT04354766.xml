      Rationale : The emergence of the novel, pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) threatens
      public health. To date, there are no effective drug option to prevent the infection, nor
      therapeutics for controlling the deadly COVID-19. However, the majority of patients infected
      with SARS-Cov-2 eliminate the virus by mounting a protective antiviral immune response,
      associated in particular with the production of neutralizing antibodies. Neutralizing
      antibodies could be of particular interest for therapeutic purposes, but also for preventive
      applications, to protect people who have never been in contact with the virus, or
      immunocompromised patients.

      The objectives of this study are :

        -  To generate human monoclonal antibodies neutralizing SARS-Cov-2 from immortalized B
           cells of convalescent patients.

        -  To compare the serological profiles between convalescent patients that develop mild or
           uncomplicated illness and convalescent patients that develop a more severe disease, that
           required hospitalization and oxygen support.

        -  To compare for each patient the neutralizing efficiency of plasma to the neutralizing
           capacities of the monoclonal antibodies generated with immortalized B cells.

        This study relates to 10 adult subjects who were infected with SARS-Cov-2 (positivity
        confirmed by PCR test), who were symptomatic, and who were in the recovery phase when the
        blood sample was collected.

        Among the 10 convalescent subjects who will be sampled, we will select two distinct
        populations:

        (i) five convalescent patients (minimum 12 days after the onset of symptoms), diagnosed
        COVID + on the temporary sampling platform which was set up at HCL at the start of the
        epidemic, which notably concerns symptomatic healthcare professionals for whom
        hospitalization was not required; (ii) five convalescent patients (minimum 12 days after
        the onset of symptoms), hospitalized in the infectious diseases department of the
        Croix-Rousse hospital living in the metropolitan area of Lyon, having presented hypoxemic
        pneumonia requiring hospitalization.
