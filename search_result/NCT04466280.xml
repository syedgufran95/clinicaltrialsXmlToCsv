  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      180 people from the medical staff and high-risk people in Baqiyatallah Hospital, who are in
      close contact with patients, will enter the study. Participants will be divided into two
      intervention groups and one control group. The control group will use the full protective
      equipment assigned to the treatment staff. In addition to protective equipment, the first
      intervention team will receive a daily diet of 200 mg hydroxychloroquine tablets. The second
      intervention team, while observing and using the complete protective equipment, will place a
      thin layer of Mucodentol gel in the vestibular area of the mouth daily, every 6 to 8 hours.

      At the beginning of the treatment, qualified people will participate in the study while
      recording demographic and clinical information, PCR test will be performed, and if they have
      negative PCR, they will be in one of the 3 study groups. During the study, if the symptoms of
      the disease occur in each of the participants, the test will be taken again. If the test is
      positive, the person will withdraw from the study, and the patient's information will be
      recorded. Finally, the people present in the study will be tested for PCR, and the results of
      the disease and the side effects of the drugs will be compared.
