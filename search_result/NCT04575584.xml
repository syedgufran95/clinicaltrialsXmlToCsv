  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of molnupiravir (MK-4482)
      compared to placebo. The primary hypothesis is that molnupiravir is superior to placebo as
      assessed by the rate of sustained recovery through Day 29.

    <description>The National Early Warning Score assesses a participant's degree of illness as assessed by clinical risk prediction categories for poor clinical outcomes including mortality within 24 hours of a set of vital sign measurements. There are 7 physiological parameters, of which 6 are assigned a point value ranging from 0 to 3, and 1 is assigned a point value ranging from 0 to 2. The total aggregate score may range from 0 to 20 with an increasing aggregate score indicating increasing clinical risk.</description>

             who are not expected to survive longer than 48 hours after randomization, participants
             who are expected to require mechanical ventilation within 48 hours after
