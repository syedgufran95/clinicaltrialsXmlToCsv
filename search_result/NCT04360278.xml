      Background:

      The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a major public health issue. Right now,
      there is no vaccine to keep people from getting sick. There is also no treatment for people
      who do get sick. Researchers want to collect plasma from people who have recovered from
      COVID-19. The plasma will have antibodies against the virus that causes COVID-19. If a
      vaccine is made, people who develop immunity from the vaccine can also donate plasma.

      Objective:

      To collect plasma from people who have recovered from COVID-19 or have been vaccinated
      against the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, so that the plasma can be used to treat people
      with the disease.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18 and older who have been diagnosed with, and have recovered from, COVID-19, or
      have been vaccinated against the virus that causes COVID-19

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and blood sample. Their
      pulse, blood pressure, and temperature will be taken. Their height and weight will be
      recorded.

      Participants will donate plasma. It will be collected through whole blood donation or through
      apheresis.

      For whole blood donation, a needle will be placed in the participant s arm vein. Blood will
      be withdrawn.

      For apheresis, a needle will be placed in the participant s arm vein. Blood will be
      withdrawn. A machine will separate the plasma from the red cells. The plasma will be removed,
      and the rest of the cells will be returned to the participant either through the same needle
      or through a needle in their other arm.

      Participants will have 3 to 20 plasma donations.

      Participation will last up to 240 days.

    <textblock>
      Emerging infectious diseases such as the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic cause
      substantial morbidity and mortality. Duringthe early emergent phases of such diseases, there
      is often no vaccine to prevent infection, nor specifictherapeutic agent to treat the disease.
      The objective of this protocol is the collection of immune plasma from persons post-recovery
      from COVID-19 or vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. This plasma may potentially be used in the
      treatment or prophylaxis of active COVID-19 under other protocols.

      Candidates will be screened for eligibility to participate in plasma donations and their
      blood levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Enrolled subjects will receive a baseline physical
      and laboratory examination. Subjects with sufficient neutralizing antibody titers who meet
      standard blood bank criteria for plasma donation will then be scheduled for plasma
      collections. Plasmapheresis is the preferred method of collection, with up to 800 mL of
      plasma collected per donation depending on the weight of the donor. Collected immune plasma
      will be tested for blood-borne pathogens, and stored according to standard blood bank
      procedures. The scope of this protocol is limited to collection of plasma from subjects with
      sufficiently high anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titer. Any administration of
      convalescent immune plasma to subjects will be performed under a separate protocol.
