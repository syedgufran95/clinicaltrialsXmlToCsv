  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mental health concerns have been on the rise since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The
      pandemic has worsened risk factors for suicide, including job loss, anxiety, depression, and
      loneliness. Timely and easy access to mental health services is a dire need, and this study
      will test the efficacy and feasibility of a brief clinical intervention, Brief Skills for
      Safer Living (Brief-SfSL), at reducing suicide risk. The goal of this study is to investigate
      whether Brief-SfSL, delivered online, is a suitable, acceptable and effective method for
      reducing suicide risk and providing timely mental health services. The results from this
      study will provide vital insight into effective interventions for suicide risk that are
      accessible and can be widely distributed.

      This study will test a brief online clinical intervention targeting suicide risk that will be
      delivered widely, remotely, rapidly and with minimal load on the healthcare system in Canada.
      The &quot;Skills for Safer Living&quot; (SfSL) intervention, a transdiagnostic 20-week group therapy
      intervention designed to teach concepts, skills and coping strategies through modules
      targeting common areas of deficits (Personal Safety, Emotional Literacy, Interpersonal
      Relationships and Problem-Solving), will be adapted into a single session &quot;Brief-SfSL&quot; that
      can be delivered in an online format. The proposed study will test the effectiveness of
      Brief-SfSL on reducing suicide risk, as measured by reductions in suicidal ideation after 3
      months, and will provide evidence for a scalable intervention that can broadly reach urban
      and rural communities. Lack of suicide intervention services is an immense unmet need that is
      especially pronounced during this pandemic and is associated with increased burden on
      individuals and on the healthcare system. Considering the long wait times to access
      consistent psychiatric services, this proposed intervention is an essential step in providing
      evidence-based accessible suicide risk services during and even beyond the pandemic.

    <description>Brief-SfSL is a single-session individual therapy adaptation of the core goals/principles of the 20-week SfSL group therapy. Brief-SfSL incorporates the SfSL guiding principles of emphasizing safety, attending to the therapeutic relationship, recognizing the participant as the expert in their own experience, taking a trauma-informed approach, working with emotions while recognizing the role of alexithymia, and incorporating solution-focused concepts. The goal is to increase a person's understanding and capacity to engage in what would enable them to keep safe, even if thoughts of suicide are present. The intervention procedure is dynamic, but includes 4 core tasks: 1) understanding the individual's suicidal experience, 2) skills building, 3) developing a safety plan, and 4) identifying obstacles to enacting or engaging with the safety plan.</description>
