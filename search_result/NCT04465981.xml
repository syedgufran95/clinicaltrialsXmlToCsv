  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has negatively
      impacted global health and requires more research to develop better tests and to improve
      disease treatment.

      The purpose of this research is to aid in the testing effort by collecting samples from
      people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or are suspected of having COVID-19. Samples you
      provide will be used investigationally by INanoBio to develop a test to determine when
      antibodies against various SARS-CoV-2 proteins are detectable.

      Up to approximately 80 subjects of all ages with either a suspected or lab-confirmed
      diagnosis of COVID-19 will take part in this research.

      A longitudinal, non-randomized study to evaluate the utility of the INanoBio's protein arrays
      in detecting unique antibodies in COVID-19 patients. To study the feasibility of utilizing a
      viral proteome microarray for evaluating exposure status, immunity status, diagnosis, and
      prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections during and after the course of disease. The sample size is
      to include 80 subjects: 40 diagnosed with COVID-19 and 40 suspected to have COVID-19. The
      goal will be to assess antibodies throughout the subject's disease course compared to
      controls.

      Serum will be isolated from periodic clinical blood specimens during the entire duration of
      the patient's hospital stay. Whole blood and plasma may also be collected. The CoV-2 protein
      serology assay will be performed on each sample.
