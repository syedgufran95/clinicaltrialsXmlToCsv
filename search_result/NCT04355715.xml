  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research aims to improve the screening for COVID-19 upon admission to the Montpellier
      University Hospital for an act under general anesthesia or at high risk of transmission of
      the virus. Indeed, routine nasal swabs present many false negatives (60 to 70%) and many
      patients with the coronavirus have little or no symptoms. Performing a chest CT scan can
      reveal early signs very suggestive of viral pneumoniae due to the new coronavirus without
      additional risk compared to a simple chest X-ray (no injection of contrast medium, low
      exposure).

      The objective is to assess the sensitivity of the diagnosis of COVID-19 by carrying out a
      nasopharyngeal RT-PCR and a low dose thoracic scanography at the hospital admission of
      patients scheduled to a procedure under general anesthesia or at risk of aerosolization
      (surgery, endoscopy, procedures involving risk of interventional radiology) in order to limit
      the risks of transmission to healthcare professionals or other patients and to rationalize
      the use of protective equipment.

      This is an observational research without modification of care in the setting of COVID-19
      pandemia. All clinical and biological data will be issued from routine care and medical
      charts. Routine use of CT scan and nasal swabs is an institutional approved strategy.
      Serologic tests will be performed as soon as available from serum collection collected after
      routine blood analysis. All data will be anonymously recorded after information and
      non-opposition of the patient.
