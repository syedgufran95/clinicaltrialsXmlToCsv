  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disproportionate impact of COVID-19 in patients with obesity is now well established.

      Obesity is associated with severe forms of COVID-19 and may be a risk factor of intensive
      care unit (ICU) admission. Obesity is associated with COVID-19 related hospital death in a
      large United Kingdom cohort study. However, there is a gap of knowledge on assessment of
      outcomes such as severity of Acute Respiratory Distress syndrome (ARDS), duration of
      hospitalisation and mortality in ICU. Moreover, an obesity survival paradox has been observed
      in patients with ARDS. This raises the question whether the obesity paradox has been broken
      by COVID-19.

      The investigators aim to explore risk factors of in-ICU death for patient with COVID-19,
      including obesity and other chronic diseases and to describe the clinical course and
      outcomes, including the management of acute respiratory failure and other intensive care
      management.

      The investigators aim to report ICU mortality for patients according to BMI category and to
      describe the detailed ICU clinical course of illness :

        -  Risk factors for ICU mortality : age, sex, baseline comorbidities

        -  Causes of death

        -  Risk factors for use of non invasive mechanical ventilation

        -  Non-fatal outcomes

        -  Ventilator-free days

        -  ICU length of stay.
