  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single dose of Reference product containing 200 mg umifenovir hydrochloride monohydrate
      equivalent to 200 mg umifenovir hydrochloride and a single dose of Test product containing
      200 mg umifenovir hydrochloride monohydrate equivalent to 200 mg umifenovir hydrochloride or
      vice versa; administered with 240 mL of water at room temperature, in each period under
      fasting conditions with Covid-19 Pandemic precautions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to investigate the bioequivalence of all products, the 90% confidence intervals will
      be calculated for the geometric mean ratios of test and reference for Cmax and AUC0-tlast of
      umifenovir. These confidence intervals will then be compared with the corresponding
      acceptance ranges.

      In order to achieve a better approximation to a normal distribution, Cmax and AUC0-tlast data
      for umifenovir will be logarithmically transformed (base e) before analysis. The sources of
      variation will be treatments, periods, sequences and subjects within the sequence. Evaluation
      of treatment, period, sequence and subject (nested within sequence) effects at 5% level of
      significance will be performed. From the result, the two one-sided hypothesis at the 5% level
      of significance will be tested by constructing the 90% confidence interval for the geometric
      mean ratios of test/reference products. The confidence interval is calculated by
      retransformation of the shortest confidence interval for the difference of the ln-transformed
      mean values. Differences in tmax will be evaluated non-parametrically.
