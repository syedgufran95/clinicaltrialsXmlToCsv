  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic brought new challenges to our nationwide healthcare system, with rapid
      escalation of the number of affected individuals over a handful of weeks. From March 13, a
      first set of measures was taken to minimise the spread of the virus, which largely impacted
      societal and economical daily life. A view days later, on March 17, the country was put in
      &quot;lockdown&quot; and all non-urgent medical treatments were cancelled or postponed. As recommended
      by the major scientific fertility societies, all non-ivf fertility treatments were
      discontinued abruptly, whereas started ivf stimulations were continued until oocyte
      aspiration, where after a freeze-all strategy was applied.

      There is little information available for women aiming for pregnancy or embarking on assisted
      conception. Given the modelling of the pandemic, including the time to peak and subsequent
      tail, considerable delays in conception to substantially attenuate risk may be required,
      which will inevitably impact patients wellbeing and overall success rates.

      A questionnaire was developed to explore patients perspectives on different aspects of their
      fertility treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic.

      The questionnaire contains the following sections:

        -  demographic variables;

        -  questions regarding the fertility history of the respondent;

        -  questions regarding the impact of fertility treatment cancellation / postponing
           fertility treatment during COVID-19 on their life, psychological wellbeing and
           relationship;

        -  questions regarding continuing medical treatment on their own, or seeking treatment
           elsewhere;

        -  questions regarding the satisfaction of measures taken by their fertility center
           regarding the COVID-19 pandemic;

        -  questions regarding expectations of further treatments, with focus on safety issues
           related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

      Eligible patients will be selected electronically from our database and digital agenda. After
      selection, patients will be contacted via email to participate. Two reminders will be send in
      case the questionnaire is not filled out: a first reminder after one week, a second reminder
      after two weeks.
