      RuxCoFlam is a single arm, non-randomized open phase II trial for front line treatment of
      Covid-19 patients with defined hyperinflammation. Purpose of the study is the reversal of
      hyperinflammation to improve pulmonary function, reduce respiratory dependency and reduce
      mortality. Patients with a hyperinflammation Score 10/16 without a clinical diagnosis of
      sepsis will be treated with 2 x 10mg Ruxolitinib with defined response adapted dose
      escalation up to 2 x 20mg for a duration of 7 days with clinical and/or radiographic response
      assessment. Inflammation assessment will be performed every other day (day 3, 5,7) using the
      CIS. In patients with unaffected CIS alteration &lt; 25% or increasing CIS &gt; 25% dose escalation
      by 5mg steps (15mg, day3; 20mg day 5) at the investigator´s discretion. Treatment can be
      extended up to 28 days if clinically indicated and the benefits of treatment outweigh the
      risks. Primary endpoint of the study is the overall response rate in reversal of
      hyperinflammation at day 7 compared to baseline. Secondary endpoints are total use of
      assisted oxygenation dependency (duration (days) of invasive/non-invasive ventilation or
      duration (days) of high-flow Oxygen support), radiologic response (reversal of pulmonary
      Covid-signs, Lung-XRay/CT), day 15 clinical status and day 15 and day 29 mortality. Patients
      aged ≥18 years hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia (demonstrated by CXRAY or chest CT), with
      a study specific Covid Inflammation Score ≥ 10 are eligible. Patients with active
      tuberculosis or uncontrolled bacterial, fungal, viral, or other infection (besides SARS-CoV-2
      virus) will be excluded from the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Patient or guardian must provide written informed consent (and assent if
             applicable) before any study assessment is performed.

          -  2. Male and female patients aged ≥ 18 years.

          -  3. Patients with temperature &gt; 37.3°C

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. History of hypersensitivity to any drugs or metabolites of similar chemical classes
             as ruxolitinib.

             using highly effective methods of contraception as defined below, throughout the study
             and for up to 90 days after stopping treatment.

        Highly effective contraception methods include:

          -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             patient). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
             post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

             hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking
             study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of
             the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.

          -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). The vasectomized male
             partner should be the sole partner for that patient.

          -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception. Placement of an
             intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) or other forms of hormonal
             contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example hormone
             vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception (in case of oral contraception,
             patients should have been using the same pill on a stable dose for a minimum of 3
             months before Screening).

        Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12
        months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age
        appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy
        (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks
        ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
        been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing
        potential.
