      Objective: To assess whether adjunctive therapy of COVID-19 infection with atorvastatin
      reduces the deterioration in hospitalized patients and improves clinical outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a Î²-coronavirus that binds to the zinc peptidase
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). No drug is licensed to treat COVID-19, but adjunctive
      pharmacologic interventions have been proposed for their immunomodulatory effects, including
      statins. About 5% of cases are considered critical, with severe respiratory failure as well
      as myocarditis, and thromboses, and are associated with high fatality rate. Statins affect
      endothelial dysfunction and have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects.

      This prospective, randomized, open-label trial of atorvastatin as adjunctive treatment of
      COVID-19 in hospitalized patients aims to study:

        1. Will atorvastatin reduce progression to severe or critical COVID-19 disease and death
           compared to standard care?

        2. Will atorvastatin lead to improved clinical outcome of COVID-19 disease at 30 days
           compared to standard care?
