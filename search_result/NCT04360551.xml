    <textblock>
      This study will enroll 40 symptomatic outpatients tested positive for Coronavirus 2019
      (COVID-19). Patients to be randomized 1:1 to Telmisartan (40 mg) vs placebo to be
      administered orally once daily x 21 days. Daily, the study patients will be asked to keep a
      record of the severity of their fever, dyspnea and fatigue and take their blood pressure (BP)
      and temperature. Study visits to occur on day 1 (entry), day 4, day 10 and day 21.
      Oro-pharyngeal swabs, and approximately 25 cc of blood will be collected at each study visit
      for safety labs and for the evaluation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) system and for
      various blood biomarkers of inflammation, coagulation and fibrosis.
