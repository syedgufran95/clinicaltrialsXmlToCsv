  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intensive action has been taken around the globe to fight the corona virus SARS-COV-2
      (COVID-19) pandemia. Clinical symptoms of the infection appear to be variable, from basically
      asymptomatic infections and mild, flu-like symptoms up to severe respiratory insufficiency,
      requiring mechanical ventilation at the intensive care unit, and death. Broad testing for
      COVID-19 infection has been proven difficult in clinical practice and hampered by limited
      resources. Urgently needed epidemiological data on the rate of silent, asymptomatic
      infections in the population and the percentage of individuals that have already developed
      immunity are still missing. Within this study we therefore plan to (i) determine the
      proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers in (a) German Cancer Research Center
      (DKFZ) employees, who work and are present at the center during the time of extended minimum
      operation and (b) in all DKFZ employees before onboarding when extended minimum operation has
      been terminated. We plan to (ii) develop a high-throughput assay for COVID-19 testing as well
      as (iii) a serum-based COVID-19 antibody assay. Finally, we will (iv) analyze for a possible
      correlation between oral microbiome and COVID-19 infection status.
