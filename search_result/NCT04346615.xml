  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a CGRP receptor antagonist may potentially blunt
      the severe inflammatory response at the alveolar level, delaying or reversing the path
      towards oxygen desaturation, ARDS, requirement for supplemental oxygenation, artificial
      ventilation or death in patients with COVID-19 on supplemental oxygen.

      * BHV-3500, formerly &quot;vazegepant&quot;, is now referred to as &quot;zavegepant&quot; (za ve' je pant). The
      World Health Organization (WHO) International Nonproprietary Names (INN) Expert Committee
      revised the name to &quot;zavegepant&quot; which was accepted by the United States Adopted Names (USAN
      ) Council for use in the U.S. and is pending formal adoption by the INN for international
      use.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must provide informed consent in accordance with requirements of the study
             center's institutional review board (IRB) or eithics committee prior to the initiation
             of any protocol-required procedures

          2. Subjects must agree to provide all requested demographic information (i.e. gender,
             race)

          3. Subjects must be able to read and understand English or Spanish

          4. Subjects must be over the age of 18 years

          5. Subjects must have laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by
             PCR-based commercial or public health assay

          6. Subjects must have symptoms that require hospitalization with supplemental oxygen and
             / or non-invasive ventilation as determined by the admitting physician. The maximum
             nasal cannula O2 concentration should be determined by the treating clinician and the
             limitations of the specific equipment

          7. Subjects must be willing and able to comply with study-related procedures/assessments

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects in immediate need of invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal
             membrane oxygenation (ECMO)

          2. Subjects with an eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min, at the Screening Visit

         10. Subjects receiving investigational therapies as part of a formal clinical trial for
             the treatment of COVID-19. During the course of this study, investigational therapies
             that may become &quot;standard of care&quot; to treat COVID-19, but are not part of a clinical
             trial, are allowed

             extrapulmonary TB

             empiric antibiotics are permitted.

         16. Subjects who have participated in any clinical research study evaluating an IP or
             therapy within 3 months and less than 5 half-lives of IP prior to the screening visit

         17. Subjects with any physical examination findings and/or history of any illness that, in
             the opinion of the study investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose
             an additional risk to the subject by their participation in the study
