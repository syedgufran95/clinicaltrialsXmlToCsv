  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown that some individuals may be asymptomatic but continue to shed the
      COVID-19 virus. These individuals may represent a population that can unknowingly transmit
      the virus. Healthcare workers (HCW) may acquire COVID-19 from the community or from possibly
      infected patients. It is important to gather data with respect to this to further understand
      the prevalence of asymptomatic carriage in individuals who work in research facilities,
      offices and clinical areas of hospitals and research facilities/institutes since this has
      important implications for infection control, as well as staff and patient safety. The
      purpose of this study is to test whether a proportion of these individuals may be
      asymptomatic shedders of the COVID-19 virus.

      Healthcare workers of participating institutions who agree to be participants will:

        -  Fill out some information about participants into a database portal system. Participants
           will have the ability to check their COVID-19 test results via the portal.

        -  Have nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs done for COVID-19 testing. This can be done about once a
           week for up to 8 weeks (about 1-8 swabs total).

        -  Provide optional blood samples to look for COVID-19 specific antibodies and/or proteins
           at the time of enrollment and after 8 weeks.

        -  Fill out questionnaires about participant exposures and travel history, occupation
           category, any symptoms in the past 21 days, whether they have provided any face-to-face
           care of a known COVID-19 positive patients in past 14 days or if participants have any
           children at home who are less than 12 years of age.

        -  Fill out an optional questionnaire about their mental health

        -  Be contacted by telephone if participants are tested positive, to determine whether
           participants have symptoms of COVID-19, and for the results of any follow-up COVID-19
           testing that may have been done.
