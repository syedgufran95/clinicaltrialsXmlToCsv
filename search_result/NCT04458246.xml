  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data show that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms can be severe in 4% and 3% of
      the adolescents aged 11-15 years and â‰¥ 16 years, respectively. In addition, the prevalence of
      chronic diseases among adolescents has increased in the last years. About 20% of the
      adolescents have some chronic disease, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. In
      march, 2020, the quarantine was officially implemented in Sao Paulo, while elective medical
      appointments for adolescents with chronic disease were temporarily suspended. To mitigate the
      deleterious effect of the social isolation on physical and mental health among these
      patients, this study aims to test the effects of an online, home-based, exercise training
      program.
