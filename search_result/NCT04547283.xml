    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine if a strategy of recommending prone (on stomach) positioning of
      patients positive or suspected positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requiring
      supplemental oxygen, but not mechanically ventilated, Is feasible in the inpatient setting.
      This study will be performed as a pragmatic pilot clinical trial to gain information relevant
      to the future conduct of a larger trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing coronavirus
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has rapidly led to significant morbidity and mortality
      worldwide, primarily through lower respiratory tract involvement progressing from hypoxemia
      to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Novel approaches to improving oxygenation are
      urgently needed to limit aerosolization concerns and resource scarcity associated with
      intubation and, to a lesser extent, other forms of advanced respiratory support.

      Prone positioning in mechanically ventilated patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure has
      been associated with improvement in oxygenation and mortality in patients with acute
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The prone position appears to provide more uniform lung
      perfusion, shifting ventilation to well-perfused lung segments and recruitment of dependent
      atelectatic regions of lung. Physiological alterations associated with the prone position
      would foreseeably also apply to spontaneously breathing patients and evidence from small
      observational studies suggests that prone positioning in non-intubated patients is feasible
      associated with improvement in oxygenation. However, it remains unknown if a prone
      ventilation strategy is truly beneficial for non-intubated hypoxic Covid-19 patients, and
      this question has stimulated interest in the conduct of rigorous randomized controlled trials
      (RCT).

      However, the awake prone strategy is a complex medical intervention with multiple
      implementation nuances such as adoption, feasibility, and tolerability that may affect
      successful conduct of a definitive RCT. In order to increase the likelihood of a successful
      future RCT, the investigators will conduct the APPS pilot study. The overall aim of the APPS
      pilot trial was to assess feasibility and important contextual factors for a large RCT to
      compare the clinical effectiveness of an Awake-Prone Positioning Strategy (APPS) for
      respiratory support versus usual care alone for hypoxic adults with Covid-19.
