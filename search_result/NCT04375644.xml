  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic is profoundly changing the way people live and work. After the health
      impact, it is the mental and psychological impact that reaches varying degrees in the entire
      world population. The previous Asian epidemics have had a lasting impact on the health
      professionals concerned.

      In France, no study has yet assessed the psychological impact of this health crisis on the
      level of health professionals. Investigators propose to study prospectively the evolution of
      the state of stress and anxiety of all the professionals practicing within the
      gynecology-obstetrics departments of 18 French hospitals.

      Investigators also hypothesize that the mental repercussions in terms of stress and anxiety
      within the same service could be different depending on the professional status and the place
      of exercise (the French regions being impacted in different ways).

      In addition to the epidemiological interest, the results of this study may help us to target
      regions and professionals who will need psychological support during and after this serious
      health crisis.
