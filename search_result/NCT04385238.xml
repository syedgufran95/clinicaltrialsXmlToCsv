  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the health and wellbeing of pregnant and recently
      pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic using an online survey.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Millions of women will give birth during the pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
      caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The consequences
      of COVID-19 for pregnant women and their offspring are unknown. This lack of information
      leads to anxiety among pregnant women, women who are considering getting pregnant, and their
      families. It is therefore important to assess the wellbeing and mental health of women during
      the COVID-19 pandemic.

      The international nature of the online survey will allow the evaluation of how living during
      the COVID-19 pandemic affects pregnant and recently pregnant women at a global level,
      including the evaluation of potential cultural and geographic differences.

    <time_frame>Anytime during pregnancy or within 6 months after given birth.</time_frame>
    <description>Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Symptoms will be assessed by the Impact of Events Scale-6. This scale includes a total of six items: two items from each of the three subscales of the measure, namely intrusion, hyperarousal and avoidance. Participants will be asked to report their PTSD symptoms in the past 7 days on a Likert Scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely).</description>
