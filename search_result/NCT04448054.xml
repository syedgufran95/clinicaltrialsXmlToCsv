  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When patients arrive in the waiting room of the MRI department, patients will be given the
      briefing note explaining the purpose of the study and how it is going. During the
      consultation, the radiologist will check the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria, and will
      take the time to answer all of the patient's questions about the study (or his family member
      by telephone if the patient does not is not in a condition to give its consent).

      The MRI examination will be performed on a 3T multi-parametric MRI. If the neurological
      disorder presented by the patient does not require an injection as part of routine care, only
      a high resolution 3D T2 sequence on the nasosinus cavities and the olfactory tract, called
      bFFE-Xd for approximately 2 min.

      If the neurological disorder presented by the patient requires an injection as part of
      current care, the examination will be completed with the nasosinus and olfactory 3D bFFE-Xd
      sequence, and the following additional sequences performed after post injection: a

        -  3D FABIR 0.9 sequence covering the brain, dedicated to exploring the subarachnoid
           spaces;

        -  a 3D T1 TSE 0.7 sequence covering the brain looking for meningeal or encephalic contrast
           enhancement,

        -  FLAIR HR coronal sequence (high resolution) exploring the limbic system.

        -  Optional: a 3D FLAIR &quot;labyrinth&quot; sequence in the event of hearing / balance problems; a
           DCE infusion sequence (T1-WI) on the olfactory tract if olfactory disorder, which will
           be the first sequence made at the time of injection.

    <description>Case 1: Routine care protocol not requiring injection
Realization of the non-injected MRI protocol adapted to the indication
+ Addition of a 3D bFFE-Xd sequence (+ 2 min) The protocol will last the examination time usually provided by the current treatment according to the indication + 2 min of complementary sequence Case 2: Routine treatment protocol requiring an injection
Realization of the injected MRI protocol adapted to the indication
Before gadolinium injection:
Addition of a 3D bFFE-Xd sequence (+ 2 min) before injection
After gadolinium injection:
Option 1: if olfaction disorder, addition of DCE perfusion sequence (T1-WI) which will be the 1st post injection sequence (+ 4 min 30)
FABIR 0.9 3D sequence (+ 4 min)
3D sequence T1 TSE 0.7 (+ 2 min 30)
FLAIR HR coronal sequence (+ 3 min 30)
Option 2: if hearing / balance disorder, adding 3D FLAIR &quot;labyrinth&quot; sequence (+ 6min) which will be the 1st post injection sequence</description>
