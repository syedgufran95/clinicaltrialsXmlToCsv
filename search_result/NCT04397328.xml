  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults are at the highest risk of complications and severe illness for 2019-nCoV
      infections. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an emerging chemoprophylaxis, which holds clinical and
      mechanistic plausibility, will help to reduce disease incidence and mitigate disease severity
      across in-patient settings. This study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of
      post-exposure prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for the prevention of Coronavirus
      Infectious Disease-19 (COVID-19) in high-risk older individuals in long-term and specialized
      care.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: HCQ blocks SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells in vitro, and it also has
      immunomodulatory effects; therefore, it may be effective in reducing viral presence and
      inhibiting immunopathological mechanisms of COVID-19 in patients if administered before
      manifestation of clinical symptoms.

      Hypothesis: the investigators hypothesize that prophylactic HCQ treatment in high-risk
      individuals Long Term Care (LTC) and Specialized Care (SC) settings post confirmed exposure
      to SARS-CoV-2 will reduce morbidity and mortality to COVID-19 via a) reduced viral presence
      during the acute phase of the infection, and b) inducing protective immune cell populations,
      c) reducing the production of inflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood.

      Objectives:

      Test if HCQ can prevent the development of COVID-19 in high-risk individuals in institutions
      which provide LTC or SC after known accidental exposure to the SARS-CoV-2.

      Test if early presumptive therapy in asymptomatic high-risk individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2
      can limit disease progression and acute care hospitalization.

      Study drug or placebo initiated after exposure, but before symptoms of elevated temperature,
      cough, or shortness of breath.

      If the exposed patients developed respiratory symptoms, specifically fever, cough or dyspnea,
      the blinded treatment will be continued and usual supportive care added as per clinician
      preference. If antiviral or immunomodulatory therapy is recommended, the patient treatment
      allocation will be unblinded, and treatment may be administered as per clinician preference
      with consideration of locally available agents.

      Safety will be closely monitored during the study conduct with safety labs and 6 lead ECGs at
      baseline, day 2, 5, 12, and 19
