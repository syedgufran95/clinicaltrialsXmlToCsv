    <textblock>
      QuadraMune(TM) is a nutritional supplement which has previously been demonstrated to possess
      antiinflammatory and immune modulatory activity based on in vitro and pilot in vivo studies.
      The current clinical trial aims to assess in a 500 volunteer trial the efficacy of
      QuadraMune(TM) in reducing infection in individuals at high risk of COVID-19.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      QuadraMune(TM) is composed of 4 natural ingredients.

      Pterostilbene is an analogue of resveratrol, and has been shown to possess antiinflammatory
      activity. Additionally, this compound suppresses macrophage activation while enhancing NK
      activity.

      Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is one of the active ingredients in green tea and has been
      shown to act as an activator of T cells, and a suppressor of neutrophil mediated
      inflammation.

      Sulforaphane is derived from broccoli and studies have shown that it protects lungs from
      inflammatory pathology.

      Thymoquinone, which is chemically related to hydroxychloroquine, possessing antiviral effects
      and increases NK activity.

      QuadraMune is a combination of these ingredients and is believed to possess superior in vitro
      and in vivo therapeutic properties as compared to when the ingredients are administered
      individually.

      The study aims to assess preventative effects of QuadraMune(TM) administration for 12 weeks.
