      This is a single center, randomized, double-blind, 2-arm, parallel-group study of DuACT in
      participants with clinical symptoms of COVID-19 that have begun within the past 48 hours
      prior to testing. A confirmatory diagnosis of COVID-19 via nasopharyngeal swab, with a
      positive PCR result within 48 hours of testing.

      Consented participants who complete screening and meet study eligibility criteria will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive DuACT or Placebo for 5 days.

      Study drugs will be administered BID for 5 days with a loading dose on Day 1. Following
      randomization, participants will complete a symptom questionnaire, record temperature and
      record oxygen saturation daily for 10 days and at day 28. A thermometer and pulse oximeter
      will be provided to each patient at the baseline visit (Day 1).

      On study days 3, 6 and 10 participants will have a clinic or home visit by a home healthcare
      provider. At these visits, a mid-turbinate nasal swab will be obtained, confirmation of the
      patient's clinical symptoms questionnaire will be completed and any adverse events will be
      assessed.
