  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous cardiovascular intervention procedures (e.g. coronary angioplasty, peripheral
      artery angioplasty) must be performed in person, requiring the physical presence of one or
      more medical, nursing and technical professionals. The control of catheters and
      interventional materials is performed manually, with the operator positioned next to the
      patient. This context results in potential for reciprocal exposure to exhaled air, both for
      the professionals involved and for the patient, with an inherent risk of aerial
      contamination. It is important to note that interventional procedures are often performed on
      an urgent or emergency basis (e.g. myocardial infarction), without the possibility of
      postponement or postponement.

      The recent robot-assisted cardiovascular intervention makes it possible to modify this
      scenario by allowing the procedure to be performed effectively and safely in a position far
      from the patient. In an environment with high potential for contamination, mainly related to
      the current pandemic caused by the COVID-19 virus, may prove to be a tactic to expand
      hospital security.

      It is in this sense that the present pilot proposal is inserted, which, ultimately, aims to
      evaluate the potential of robotic intervention as a strategy to reduce exposure to exhaled
      air of patients and professionals during the intervention procedure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age&gt; = 18 years;

          -  Cardiovascular disease characterized by:

          -  Symptomatic ischemic heart disease and / or objective evidence of myocardial ischemia
             with one or more target lesions OR

          -  Symptomatic peripheral arterial disease and / or with objective evidence of the need
             for percutaneous intervention of one or more target lesions;

          -  The target lesion (s) must be obstructive and / or aneurysmatic (visual analysis);

          -  Interventionist planning for all target lesions should include robotic manipulation in
