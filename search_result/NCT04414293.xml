      The administration of low-dose lung irradiation produces anti-inflammatory effects that will
      decrease the pulmonary inflammatory response.

      The present study will evaluate the efficacy of treatment with low-dose pulmonary
      radiotherapy added to standard support therapy, in hospitalized patients with respiratory
      symptoms due to COVID-19 pneumonia, who do not experience improvement with conventional
      medical therapy and are not subsidiaries of ICU

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The WHO has officially confirmed that: &quot;Currently, there is no specific pharmacological
      available treatment for COVID-19&quot;.

      Beyond vital support, there are not currently treatment options for Coronavirus disease
      (COVID-19) and related pneumonia, the infection caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
      Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Pulmonary irradiation is an option for the treatment of COVID-19
      pneumonia and could be available quickly and with a duration of about 15 minutes of
      treatment.

      Thoracic irradiation therapy at very low doses (0.5-1.0 Gy) dates back to the 1920s and was
      the only effective mean to treat certain infectious and inflammatory diseases prior to the
      development of antimicrobial therapies in the 1940s.

      The goal is to replicate low-dose radiation therapy, just as it was used 80 years ago for
      viral pneumonia with great success. It will be administered for a new disease, pneumonia
      caused by COVID-19, for which there is no cure and many people are dying, mainly from severe
      acute respiratory syndrome leading to very severe hypoxemic acute respiratory failure
      refractory to treatment.

      This therapy is expected to remedy acute respiratory syndrome by reducing inflammation, and
      it also has a low risk of side effects and toxicities, given the low doses received, more
      than one hundred times lower, compared to the usual radiotherapy used to tumor treatment.
