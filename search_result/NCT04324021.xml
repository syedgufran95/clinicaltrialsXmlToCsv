  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As shown by the data available, hyper-inflammation, caused by a cytokine storm resulting from
      an exaggerated response of the immune system to the presence of the virus, is considered to
      represent one of the most important negative prognostic factor in patients infected with
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The objective of this study is
      to investigate new possibilities to reduce the number of patients requiring mechanical
      ventilation. This is intended to address the most urgent need to preserve the access to
      intensive care unit support to the lowest possible number of patients and may potentially
      reduce mortality.

      This is an open label, controlled, parallel group, 3-arm, multicenter study to assess the
      efficacy and safety of Emapalumab or Anakinra, versus standard of care (SoC). Patients
      between 30 and 80 years will be eligible to participate in the study. The study is planned to
      consist of three groups, each comprising 18 patients. Treatment will be randomized to either
      Emapalumab+SoC, Anakinra+SoC or only SoC for two weeks. Follow-up visit or phone calls will
      be made 4 and 8 weeks after end of treatment period.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed informed consent provided by the patient, or by the patient's legally
             authorized representative(s), as applicable.

          2. Documented presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection as per hospital routine.

          3. Age &gt; 30 to &lt; 80 years at the time of screening.

          4. Presence of respiratory distress, defined as:

               1. PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 300 mm Hg and &gt;200 mm Hg or

               2. Respiratory Rate (RR) ≥30 breaths/min or

               3. SpO2 &lt; 93 percent in air at rest. Note: Patients given continous positive airway
                  pressure (CPAP) ventilator support are eligible for inclusion.

          5. Presence of hyperinflammation defined as:

             a. Lymphocyte counts &lt; 1000 cells/µL, and b. Two of the following three criteria: i.
             Ferritin &gt; 500ng/mL ii. LDH &gt; 300 U/L iii. D-Dimers &gt; 1000 ng/mL

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients in mechanical ventilation or with modified early warning score (MEWS) &gt;4 with
             evidence of moderate or above ARDS (Berlin definition, namely with PaO2/FiO2 &gt;100, but
             &lt;200 mm Hg) or severe respiratory insufficiency or evidence of rapid worsening
             (respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation or presence of shock or
             presence of concomitant organ failure requiring ICU admission). Note: For the
             evaluation of patient eligibility, temperature will not be considered in the
             calculation of the total MEWS score since presence of fever is a hallmark of
             SARS-CoV-s infection

          2. Impairment of cardiac function defined as poorly controlled heart diseases, such as
             New York heart association (NYHA) class II (mild) and above, cardiac insufficiency,
             unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within 1 year before enrollment,
             supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmia need treatment or intervention.

          3. Severe renal dysfunction (estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) or
             receive continuous renal replacement therapy, hemodialysis, or peritoneal dialysis.

          4. Uncontrolled hypertension (seated systolic blood pressure &gt;180 mmHg, or diastolic
             blood pressure &gt;110mmHg) .

          5. Administration of plasma from convalescent patients who recovered from SARS-CoV-2
             infection.

          6. Clinical suspicion of latent tuberculosis.

          7. History of hypersensitivity or allergy to any component of the study drug.

          8. Pregnant women.

          9. Existence of any life-threatening co-morbidity or any other medical condition which,
             in the opinion of the investigator, makes the patient unsuitable for inclusion.

         10. Enrollment in another concurrent clinical interventional study, or intake of an
             investigational drug within three months or 5 half-lives prior to inclusion in this
             study, if considered interfering with this study objectives as assessed by the
             Investigator.

         11. Foreseeable inability to cooperate with given instructions or study procedures.
