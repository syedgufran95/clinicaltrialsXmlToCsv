  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 outcomes are worse in male patients. Androgen signaling, therefore, is a target for
      clinical exploration. TMPRSS2 is a membrane protease required for COVID pathogenesis that is
      regulated by androgens. Blocking TMPRSS2 with bicalutamide may reduce viral replication and
      improve the clinical outcome. Therefore, the study proposes to test bicalutamide at 150 mg
      oral daily dosing in a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial in male patients with
      early symptomatic COVID-19 disease.
