  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of nanomaterials in facial respirators could decrease the permeability of particles
      and promote a biocidal effect compared to conventional respirators (N95) and, therefore,
      enhance the filtering power, aiming to mitigate harmful effects of bacteria and viruses.
      Chitosan is a natural cationic polymer derived from chitin, with important characteristics
      such as being biodegradable, biocompatible, non-toxic, and presenting antimicrobial activity.
      This polymer shows virucidal activity in several types of viruses, including other
      coronavirus serotypes, given the attractive factor of its cationic charge for negative
      charges. The effectiveness of a novel individual protection semi facial respirator (called
      VESTA) will be investigated, compared to a conventional N95 respirator. The respirators will
      be tested in healthcare professionals working in hospital environments and the effectiveness
      will be attributed to the lower incidence rate of infection by the SARS-CoV-2. The
      effectiveness of respirators will also be attributed to the ability to filter these viruses
      after use by healthcare professionals exposed to potentially contaminated environments. The
      study will be carried out in two stages: i) Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial with reduced
      sample and ii) Controlled Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT). This RCT will be conducted with
      healthcare professionals who have contact with environments/patients infected by SARS-CoV-2
      in hospital sectors with greater vulnerability to infection (urgency, emergency and intensive
      care units). The pilot trial will be conducted initially with a group of fifty participants
      (n = 25 in each group) for initial investigation of the potential for efficacy with the use
      of the respirators (VESTA and conventional N95) in two sectors (emergency and ICU) of a
      Hospital. The RCT will consist of two parallel groups: (1) Experimental Group (GExp) that
      will use the novel respirator (VESTA) and (2) Control Group (CG) that will use the standard
      respirator (N95). Participants will be recruited from participating centers and will be
      accompanied by eight consecutive shifts (each shift lasting 6 to 12 hours, followed by
      approximately 36 hours of rest). Participants will be accompanied during 21 days, and will be
      assessed at baseline (T0), at the end of the 10th day (T1) and at the end of the 21st day
      (T2). The respirators will be assessed after the end of the 1st hospital shift for
      morphological characterization (virus quantity and inactivation).

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized controlled clinical trial, characterized by the application of semi facial respirators, in which participants will be randomly and concealed allocated into two groups: VESTA respirator (GExp) and Conventional N95 respirator (CG). The participants will be healthcare professionals working in hospital environments contaminated by SARS-Cov-2. The study will be reported following the recommendations of the CONSORT Statement.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The outcome assessor won't have any knowledge about the study purposes and will be unaware of the group allocation.
Participants will be blinded as they will not distinguish the novel respirator (VESTA) from the conventional N95 respirator (both will have the same shape, color and size).
The statistical analysis will also be performed blinded for group allocation.</masking_description>

    <arm_group_label>Novel chitosan semi facial respirator (VESTA)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>VESTA is a semi facial respirator that follows the same technical specifications of a N95 class PFF2 respirator. However, the VESTA respirator has nanoparticles in the filtering element, which is manufactured with a product of 50 gsm melt blown polypropylene-treated with an electrostatic charge. This filtering element deposits nanoparticles of polymeric biodegradable material known as chitosan. Chitosan can act as a surface for adsorption and viral inactivation.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The N95 PFF2 respirators are manufactured from TNT as defined in ABNT NBR 15052: 2004 and in the resolution of ANVISA RDC No. 356. The filtering element is usually formed by a layer of thin polypropylene fibers arranged at random. This configuration influences the particles (which constitute aerosols) to move along an extensive and tortuous path in relation to their size; thus, increasing the probability of them coming into contact with the fibers and being retained. A number of mechanisms influence the interception of particles by the fibers of the filter element. In addition to the mechanical interception mechanisms, the presence of charges on the surface of the filter material can enhance the association of particles with its fibers and optimize the efficiency of the respirator.</description>

    <description>The protocol will be composed by the use of the VESTA respirator during 21 days (approximately eight consecutive shifts - each shift lasting 6 to 12 hours, followed by approximately 36 hours of rest). Each participant will receive a total of approximately 8 respirators, with 1 respirator to be used on each shift (with instructions for a maximum usage time of 8 hours). All participants will receive a booklet with guidelines and training in the use and proper handling of the respirator. All respirators will be sterilized and packaged in the laboratory, to ensure that they are not contaminated before use by the participants. The intervention will not change the participants' routine, considering that they already follow instructions for the use of protective personal equipment (PPE) and the proposed intervention will follow all local regulations and guidelines for the use and conservation of PPE and semi facial respirators.</description>
