  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, a new type of pneumonia, COVID-2019 outbroke in Wuhan ,China, and currently
      the infected has been reported in more than at least 75 countries.

      Patients with severe COVID-19 have rapid disease progression and high mortality rate. This
      may attribute to the excessive immune response caused by cytokine storm. Strategies based on
      anti-virus drugs and treatments against symptoms have now been employed. However, these
      managements can't effectively treat the lethal lung injury and uncontrolled immune responses,
      especially in the elderly with severe COVID-19. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which
      treats the disease from anther perspective, has achieved satisfactory results. National
      Health Commission of China released a series of policies to enhance the administration of TCM
      prescriptions.

      This study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Traditional Chinese Medicine as an
      adjuvant treatment for severe COVID-19.
