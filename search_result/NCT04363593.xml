  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a pandemic-like disease caused by a new coronavirus called Severe
      Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) isolated in China in 2019. Clinical
      manifestations vary widely from one individual to another, from asymptomatic carrier to a
      febrile cough that can rapidly lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Since the
      beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic, screening by chest X-ray (RT) and polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) SARS-CoV-2 conducted by the Cornwall Hospital Union laboratory has shown that
      among symptomatic patients and hospital staff suspected of being COVID-19, only 7.8% were
      attributable to COVID-19. Two nosocomial clusters were also identified, in the emergency
      department (10 carers) and in the cardiology department (6 carers and one patient). However,
      direct diagnosis by RT-PCR has sensitivity limits and can lead to false negative results when
      the subject is indeed suffering from COVID-19. This lack of sensitivity is inherent to the
      technique on the one hand, but also to the quality of the sample and the kinetics of the
      infection. Indeed, the virological window during which the virus is present in the
      respiratory mucous membranes sampled seems relatively narrow, hence a progressive
      negativation of the respiratory samples as the disease progresses. Moreover, clinical
      symptoms vary from one individual to another, and it is now recognized that some infected
      persons are asymptomatic but carry the virus. Thus, the use of a second diagnostic technique
      is a necessity, and serology could be a relevant diagnostic support.

      In the literature, several publications report the performance of COVID-19 serology in
      clusters of cases or cohorts of subjects. The serological techniques employed are variable
      (target epitopes in particular) and frequently homemade. Serology is mainly studied in
      comparison or association with RT-PCR in order to highlight the increased performance of
      COVID-19 diagnosis when the two techniques are combined. Correlation with chest CT imaging
      data is also encountered.

      Numerous serological tests are therefore being tested to determine retrospectively whether
      the individual has been exposed to the virus by looking for specific antibodies to the virus.
      The supreme health authority has drawn up specifications dated 16 April 2020, defining the
      methods for evaluating the performance of serological tests detecting antibodies directed
      against SARSCoV-2 in order to provide a framework for these practices. Several clinical
      studies are also underway, in particular to assess the kinetics of the appearance of the
      antibodies, whether these specific antibodies would be protective and whether their
      appearance would coincide with a cessation of contagiousness. Thus, the main objective of
      this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the COVID-19 immunoglobulin (IgG)
      Dia-Pro serological test, in view of its deployment at the Cornish Hospital Union Laboratory.
      Subsequently, given the low prevalence of COVID-19 in Brittany and the risk of a second
      epidemic wave when the confinement is lifted, the evaluation of the seroprevalence of the
      staff of the Cornish Hospital Union is necessary in order to assess the attack rate of
      COVID-19 within the establishment and particularly within departments where nosocomial
      clusters have been reported; and to prevent the impact of deconfinement. Indeed, knowledge of
      the proportion of immunized personnel and its distribution according to services will make it
      possible to establish internal recommendations and to effectively manage personal protective
      equipment inventories, in conjunction with the deconfinement strategy that will be
      implemented by the government. The goal is to protect hospital staff from overexposure to the
      virus;
