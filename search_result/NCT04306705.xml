    <textblock>
      Some patients infected with the COVID-19 can develop uncontrolled immune response, leading to
      potentially life-threatening damage to lung tissue. Tocilizumab was first approved by the
      U.S. FDA in 2010 for rheumatoid arthritis and might now be used to treat serious COVID-19
      patients with lung damage, according to China's National Health Commission updated its
      treatment guidelines in 7th version.Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) was
      recommended by China's National Health Commission treatment guidelines in 1st-7th version to
      control sever COVID-19 patients.

      Tocilizumab doesn't directly kill the novel coronavirus. It's known as an inhibitor of the
      receptor of interleukin 6 (IL-6), a pro-inflammatory cytokine. In the disease COVID-19, the
      body may respond to the pathogen by overproducing immune cells and their signaling molecules
      in a dangerous phenomenon called cytokine release storm.It has been recently speculated that
      IL-6 as a main culprit in that immune over activation among COVID-19 patients, hence the
      Tocilizumab clinical trial was initiated. In 2017, the FDA also approved Tocilizumab to treat
      cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a form of cytokine storm caused by CAR-T treatment. The
      investigator's hypothesis was that Tocilizumab would be associated with better clinical
      outcomes, such as decreased systemic inflammation, improved survival rate, better hemodynamic
      and improved of respiratory distress.Systemic inflammatory response syndrome was one of the
      main indications for treatment with CRRT. So it is clinically significant to compare the
      efficacy and safety of Tocilizumab and CRRT in management of CRS triggered by COVID-19.
