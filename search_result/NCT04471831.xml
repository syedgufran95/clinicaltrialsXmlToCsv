      Background: Coronavirus (CoViD-19) positive stroke survivors (SSv) with comorbidities faces
      possibility for mortality. Study reports success of physiotherapy in CoViD-19 positive SSv
      with multiple comorbidities.

      Methods: This clinical controlled study involve a minimum of 30 SSv and 30 age and
      sex-matched non-stroke individuals with multiple comorbidities with CoViD-19 status confirmed
      using Real-Time Quantitative-Polymerase Chain Reaction. The Cycle Threshold (CT) and nucleic
      acid content in the test sample (NA) will be recorded from the virology test results. Their
      exercise endurance, exercise capacities and quality of life will be assessed using 3-minutes'
      walk test and 3-meters test and Stroke Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire. Measurements
      will be taken at every three days intervals from admission to discharge from
      hospital-isolation. They will receive their normal treatments for CoViD-19 in addition to
      daily Physiotherapy for the SSv delivered through E-Platform. the Zoom and the WhatsApp video
      platforms will be used for the interactions between the physiotherapists and the
      participants. A pre-tested exercise protocol for stroke patients developed by the Stroke and
      Nervous System Disorders research group of the University of Lagos, Nigeria will be used for
      the E-exercises. The exercise package will be loaded into the phones of the participants at
      hospital admission. The Physiotherapists will lead in the exercises through video interaction
      will the participants watches the video programme. Their risks for respiratory complications
      (RC), ventilation (RV) and death (RD) will be analysed. Data will be analysed using
      independent t-test, Analysis of Co-Variance, and multivariate retrogression, survival
      analyses, Friedman Analysis of Variance and MannWithney U test (95% Confident Interval).

      Anticipated Outcomes: It is anticipated that the outcome of this study will provide evidence
      for inclusion of Physiotherapy in the acute management of individuals tested positive for
      CoViD-19 most important for the stroke survivors tested positive for CoViD-19 at acute stage
      to reduce the odds of developing complications expedite discharge and reduce odd of death.

      Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (CoViD-19) is a new pathogen that is highly contagious,
      can spread quickly, and it is capable of causing enormous health, economic and societal
      impacts in any setting (WHO-China joint mission on CoViD-19). Although COVID 19 belongs to
      coronavirinae sub-family and coronaviridae family and different from other previous
      coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and influenza Virus with its unique characteristics. Hence,
      building scenarios and strategies only on the basis of well-known pathogens risks failing to
      exploit all possible measures to slow transmission of the COVID-19 virus, reduce disease and
      save lives.

      The COVID-19 virus is unique among human coronaviruses in its combination of high
      transmissibility, substantial fatal outcomes in some high-risk groups, and ability to cause
      huge societal and economic disruption. The current CoViD-19 pandemic arises from Severe Acute
      Respiratory Syndrome Voronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) which was first detected as pneumonia of
      unknown cause in Wuhan, China in December, 2019. It was declared as public health emergency
      of international concern in January, 2020 and global pandemic in February of the same year.
      Therefore, with the novel nature, and the continuously evolving understanding, of this
      coronavirus demands a tremendous agility in the capacity to rapidly adapt and change
      readiness and response planning both for containment and for treatment of the disease and its
      emerging sequels.

      Before the advent of CoViD-19, different types of coronavirus known in human history include
      the alpha coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63; the beta coronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and
      HCoV-HKU1; SARS-CoV, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); MERS-CoV, which
      causes Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The definitive diagnosis of CoViD-19 is made
      by analysing respiratory samples (collected by aspiration of the airways or sputum induction)
      through laboratory tests to identify the virus involved using Real-Time Polymerase Chain
      Reaction (RT-PCR) techniques.

      Although the American and Europe are mostly affected with Africa being the least affected,
      almost all the African countries have had their fair share of the pandemic both in incidence
      and in fatality. Although the first fatality was recorded in China, the fatality is now
      global. There is no gender variation in the global epidemiology of CoViD-19 but the males are
      experiencing higher fatality rate when controlled for age and the presence of comorbid health
      problem. However, in Nigeria, the mortality rate is 3.1% with male preponderance (2.2:1 male
      to female ratio) and affects more people between 31 years and 40 years.

      Between 2 days to 14 days post-exposure, individuals with CoViD-19 can have symptoms ranging
      from mild to severe including but not limited to fever, cough, difficulty in
      breathing/shortness of breath, sore throat, muscle pain, chills, new loss of taste or smell,
      nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Although the disease is fast spreading across the globe, yet
      there is no known standard cure for it neither is vaccine available against the new virus.
      However, as the disease manifest its clinical features, various case management/treatment
      guidelines are being developed and updated periodically by all national and international
      health organisations and the WHO.

      Because CoViD-19 is a novel pathogen, the existence of innate immunity in human being cannot
      be ascertained. Based on the epidemiologic characteristics observed in China, although there
      may be risk factors increasing susceptibility to infection, everyone is assumed to be
      susceptible. Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, there have been extensive attempts to
      better understand the virus and the disease globally. However, key knowledge gaps in the
      source of infection, pathogenesis and virulence of the virus, transmissibility, risk factors
      for infection and disease progression, surveillance, diagnostics, clinical management of
      severe and critically ill patients, and the effectiveness of prevention and control measures
      remain. The remarkable speed with which health experts isolated the causative virus,
      established diagnostic tools, and determined key transmission parameters, such as the route
      of spread and incubation period, provided the vital evidence for gaining invaluable time for
      the response.

      Although the radiological evidence (Lima, 2020) and laboratory tests are been used as
      complimentary approaches to objectify the diagnosis and progression of CoViD-19, the
      molecular test of choice for the etiologic diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the real
      -time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test method similar to that
      developed for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV. Within 5 to 6 days of the onset of symptoms,
      patients with COVID-19 infections have demonstrated high viral loads in their upper and lower
      respiratory tract. A nasopharyngeal swab and/or an oropharyngeal swab are often recommended
      for screening or diagnosis of early infection. In RT-PCR assay a positive reaction is
      detected by accumulation of a fluorescent signal and quantified by the cycle threshold (CT)
      values. The CT is the number of cycles required for the fluorescent signal to cross the
      threshold (exceeds background level). Cycle threshold levels are inversely proportional to
      the amount of target nucleic acid in the sample (the lower the CT level the greater the
      amount of target nucleic acid in the sample). Wisconsin Veterinary and Diagnostic Laboratory
      (WVDL) real time assays undergo 40 cycles of amplification. Cycle thresholds (CTs) less than
      29 are strong positive reactions indicative of abundant target nucleic acid in the sample,
      CTs of between 30 and 37 are positive reactions indicative of moderate amounts of target
      nucleic acid while CTs of between 38 and 40 are weak reactions indicative of minimal amounts
      of target nucleic acid which could represent an infection state or environmental
      contamination.

      Previous studies had opined that increased age, pre-existing concurrent cardiovascular or
      cerebrovascular diseases, the presence of secondary infection and elevated inflammatory
      indicators in the blood, CD3+CD8+ T-cells ≤75 cells·μL-1 and cardiac troponin I ≥0.05 ng·mL-1
      are predictors of increase in risk of mortality from CoViD-19. With stroke being a leading
      cause of death and a major cause of disability worldwide (Bay, 2001), a stroke patient with
      CoVid-19 may be said to be in pathway to death. Individuals who have experienced stroke are
      faced with a multitude of challenges to restore their quality of life within the limitation
      of residual impairment. A stroke patient with clotting disorder is in continuous dynamics of
      working against the development of deep vein thrombosis. It is even a great dilemma when a
      stroke survivor with clotting disorders has chronic respiratory problem. Much
      multi-disciplinary approaches and expertise will be needed for the recovery and
      rehabilitation of the patient. Hence, a CoViD-19 patient who ordinarily is susceptible to
      developing respiratory complications usually require experts' management especially when the
      individual has the high odd ratio of death through the presence of comorbid health such as
      restrictive respiratory disorders, diabetes, hypertension and other comorbidities. A stroke
      patient with haematological disorders especially of clotting factor disorders. If personal
      protective equipment (PPEs) are provided, a physiotherapist should be involved in the acute
      care of individuals with CoViD-19 especially when clinical manifestations of CoViD-19
      indicated how Physiotherapy can be of great help to CoViD-19 patients. There are also
      appropriate Physiotherapy management guidelines for the management of such a patient.

      Despite the success of the involvement of physiotherapy in the management of individuals
      admitted for SARS-CoV. which has similar clinical features as the novel SARS-CoV2 (CoViD-19),
      Physiotherapy are rarely involved in its management especially in low resource countries. The
      major targeted aspects for Physiotherapy in critically ill patients include deconditioning,
      muscle weakness, joint stiffness, retained airway secretions, atelectasis and avoidance of
      intubation and weaning failure. Physiotherapy is helpful in managing patients with severe
      acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS). Physiotherapy focus is to increase mobility,
      enhance oxygenation and reduce the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia. In managing SARS
      or Acute Respiratory Disorders' patients, Physiotherapy employed various treatment techniques
      such as the use of various chest Physiotherapy procedures, positioning/mobilization,
      breathing exercises techniques, coughing techniques, spirometry and Massage/manual techniques
      among others. Apart from the fact that physiotherapists have the expertise in management of
      CoViD-19 patient, a patient undergoing physiotherapy can also be infected with CoViD-19 as no
      one is immune. In order to prevent secondary complication of both the clinical manifestations
      of CoViD-19 in one hand and that of their other health problems, patients with CoViD-19
      should be treated by physiotherapists from the acute case and even in the intensive care
      units/centres. Hence, this study intends to explore success of involvement of physiotherapy
      in the acute management of stroke survivors with multiple comorbidities who are diagnosed of
      CoViD-19 in reducing odds of developing complications, reduce the odd of death and expedite
      discharge.

      Rationale/ justification of study Because the novel CoViD-19 can affect anyone including
      stroke patients who are receiving physiotherapy, it is highly imperative for a programme that
      will incorporate physiotherapy into their treatment to both prevent the possibility of
      developing complications as well as death during the isolation treatment. It will also
      address their needs for stroke recovery thereby preventing disability and dependency in
      activity of daily living due to stroke which will linger during the isolation treatment.

      Previous studies had opined that increased age, pre-existing concurrent cardiovascular or
      cerebrovascular diseases, the presence of secondary infection and elevated inflammatory
      indicators in the blood, CD3+CD8+ T-cells ≤75 cells·μL-1 and cardiac troponin I ≥0.05 ng·mL-1
      are predictors of increase in risk of mortality from CoViD-19. Since these factors are either
      predisposing factors to stroke or precipitate mortality in stroke patients, a stroke
      patient/survivor tested positive for CoViD-19 is in serious dilemma for the likelihood of
      developing complications or dying during CoViD-19 isolation treatment. With stroke being a
      leading cause of death and a major cause of disability worldwide, a stroke patient with
      CoVid-19 may be said to be in pathway to death. Individuals who have experienced stroke are
      faced with a multitude of challenges to restore their quality of life within the limitation
      of residual impairment. A stroke patient with clotting disorder is in continuous dynamics of
      working against the development of deep vein thrombosis. It is even a great dilemma when a
      stroke survivor with clotting disorders has chronic respiratory problem. Much
      multi-disciplinary approaches and expertise will be needed for the recovery and
      rehabilitation of the patient. Hence, a CoViD-19 patient who ordinarily is susceptible to
      developing respiratory complications usually require experts' management especially when the
      individual has the high odd ratio of death through the presence of comorbid health such as
      restrictive respiratory disorders, diabetes, hypertension and other comorbidities. A stroke
      patient with haematological disorders especially of clotting factor disorders. If personal
      protective equipment (PPEs) are provided, a physiotherapist should be involved in the acute
      care of individuals with CoViD-19 especially when clinical manifestations of CoViD-19
      indicated how Physiotherapy can be of great help to CoViD-19 patients. There are also
      appropriate Physiotherapy management guidelines for the management of such a patient .

      Despite the success of the involvement of physiotherapy in the management of individuals
      admitted for SARS-CoV. which has similar clinical features as the novel SARS-CoV2 (CoViD-19),
      and the fact that some individuals undergoing physiotherapy do contract CoViD-19,
      Physiotherapy are rarely involved in its management especially in low resource countries. The
      major targeted aspects for Physiotherapy in critically ill patients include deconditioning,
      muscle weakness, joint stiffness, retained airway secretions, atelectasis and avoidance of

      in the acute management of stroke survivors with multiple comorbidities who were diagnosed of
      CoViD-19 in reducing odds of developing complications and death.

           status-matched non-stroke individuals with CoViD-19 who did not receive physiotherapy
           during isolation treatment.

        5. There will be no significant difference in the rate of discharge in stroke survivors
           with CoViD-19 who received physiotherapy and their age, sex and co-morbid heath
           status-matched non-stroke individuals with CoViD-19 who did not receive physiotherapy
           during isolation treatment.

        6. There will be no significant difference in the quality of life in stroke survivors with
           CoViD-19 who received physiotherapy and their age, sex and co-morbid heath
           status-matched non-stroke individuals with CoViD-19 who did not receive physiotherapy
           during isolation treatment.

        7. Physiotherapy will not have significant effect on the exercise endurance of stroke
           survivors positive for CoViD-19.

        8. Physiotherapy will not have significant effect on the exercise capacity of stroke
           survivors positive for CoViD-19.

      Data Analysis Data will be summarized using frequency, percentage, mean and standard
      deviation. Both groups will be analysed for risk for respiratory complications (RC),
      likelihood of ventilation (LV) and risk of death (RD) at hospital-isolation admission. The
      two groups and difference dichotomies will be compared using independent t-test comparing the
      Cycle Threshold Values and the amount of Nucleic Acid in the sample. Analysis of Co-Variance
      will be used to compare the Cycle Threshold, Nucleic Acid, Exercise endurance and exercise
      capacity across the test periods in the stroke survivors while multivariate regression
      analysis will be used to predict odds of complication and survival analysis will be used to
      predict death in both groups. Their quality of life will be compared using MannWithney U test
      while Friedman Analysis of Variance will be used to compare the quality of life within the
      group across the test periods (p&lt;0.05).

    <description>The exercise package will then be sent to them after securing video contact with the prospective participant. Only participants with smart phone that can receive the video package will be selected for this study.
Physiotherapy-Patients' Engagements At every morning after their prescribed drugs might have been served in the ward, the physiotherapist will call the participant for the exercises. The patient will be connected to the physiotherapist who is in his clinic (not in the isolation ward with the patients) through a WhatsApp or zoom video call. The physiotherapist will control the rhythm and pace of the exercises through the video interactions.</description>
