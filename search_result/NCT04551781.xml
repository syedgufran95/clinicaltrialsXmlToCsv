      A randomized controlled trial to study the efficacy of low dose steroid for 14 days in the
      treatment of post-covid-19 lung infiltrates

  <detailed_description>

      : the study included patients with COVID-19 diagnosis with a positive nasopharyngeal swab,
      they were discharged from quarantine hospitals after 2 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swab
      negative for COVID-19, and have persistent radiological changes in follow-up chest computed
      tomography (CT) chest, patients with normal CT chest at discharge, patients on chemotherapy,
      patients &lt;18years old, patients with known interstitial lung disease and patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus were excluded from the study.

      Study patients were randomly assigned to either steroid group or control group and were
      followed up for 14 days, and CT chest was done at end of 14 days and was evaluated by a
      radiologist how was blinded for study arm, Ct chest was graded either very minimal
      infiltrates including reticular shadows, hallow sign, and ground glass s (GGO), infiltrates
      &lt;25%, and infiltrates &gt;25%.

      The steroid group received 20 mg/day prednisolone for 14 days in addition to symptomatic
      treatment; the control group received symptomatic treatment without steroids Data collected
      included patient demographics, symptoms, and its duration at baseline, CBC, Ferritin and
      D-dime, CT chest at discharge, and after 14 days of inclusions in the study.
