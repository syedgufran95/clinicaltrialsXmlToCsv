  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sars-Cov2 has been found in the digestive tract, as well as the respiratory tract. Protection
      of health care workers during surgery has been increased and some guidelines advocate for
      abandoning laparoscopy in COVID19 patients for fear of contamination, evenghtough this does
      not benefit the patient. However, Sars-Cov2 contamination risk during visceral surgery
      remains unknown. Inadequate protection is unnecessary costful and can be inefficient if too
      binding. Our hypotheses are that 1) Sars-Cov 2 can travel through droplet and air during
      visceral surgery. 2) Laparoscopy, because of the pneumoperitoneum and its leaks, warrant more
      air contamination whereas laparotomy warrant more droplet contamination, which would
      justified increased protection.
