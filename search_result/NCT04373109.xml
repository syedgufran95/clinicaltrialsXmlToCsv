  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 has a big impact on individuals and society as a whole. Especially persons with
      (multiple) comorbidities such as stroke are affected. The impact of COVID-19 on stroke
      rehabilitation delivery and stroke patients' functioning is unclear.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With 16'000 patients hospitalized and with new permanent disability in approximately 7'000
      individuals every year in Switzerland, stroke has a major impact on quality of life and is an
      enormous socioeconomic burden. Virtually all patients receive inpatient rehabilitation in the
      sub-acute phase poststroke. However, also in the later phases poststroke, patients receive
      rehabilitation interventions in outpatient rehabilitation clinics and private practices, with
      goal to improve or maintain their functional capacity.

      Currently, Switzerland finds itself in an extraordinary situation. The Federal Council has
      issued a series of measures aimed at the population, organizations and institutions, and the
      cantons. The aim is to curb the spread of the coronavirus and assure the provision of
      healthcare. The people are invoked to stay at home and only leave the home if absolutely
      necessary. If they are over the age of 65 or have an underlying medical condition, the
      Federal Council strongly recommend that you stay at home under any circumstances unless you
      have to go to the doctor.

      With the recommendation of the Swiss Federal Council almost all stroke patients belong to the
      group who should stay home. Furthermore, all outpatient rehabilitation clinics have reduced
      the interventions to a minimum. It is unknown how a sudden stop of rehabilitation influences
      the stroke patients' functional capacities and their perceived quality of life.
