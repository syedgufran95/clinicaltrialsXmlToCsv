  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As dental practices reopen their practices during a global pandemic, the risk of 2019 novel
      coronavirus (COVID-19) infection that dental hygienists face in providing dental care remains
      unknown. Estimating the occupational risk of COVID-19, and producing evidence on the types of
      infection control practices and dental practices that may affect COVID-19 risk, is therefore
      imperative. These findings could be used to describe the prevalence and incidence of COVID-19
      among dental hygienists, determine what infection control steps dental hygienists take over
      time, describe dental hygienists' employment during the COVID-19 pandemic, and estimate
      whether infection control adherence in dental practice is related to COVID-19 incidence.
