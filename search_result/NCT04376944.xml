  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Use lay language. The Covid-19 pandemic hit France in March 2020 and stage 3 of the epidemic
      justified the introduction of national and unprecedented containment measures from March 17,
      2020. The Montpellier CHU experienced peak hospitalizations of Covid-19 infections in late
      March. The estimate of the proportion of infected people in Occitania, South of France, for
      the 11th of May 2020 is 3.1% (95% CI: 1.9-5.9) for the Occitania region, to which Montpellier
      belongs.

      In the context of the Covid-19 epidemic, notably due to the absence of pharmacological or
      vaccine prophylaxis, barrier measures were of crucial importance, especially for exposed
      caregivers. These measures include an adaptation of individual behavior, the creation of a
      so-called &quot;Covid&quot; hospital, the wearing of specific equipment in all departments, the use in
      the rooms of Covid-19 patients of a gown, an apron, gloves, and a FFP2 type mask in the event
      of contact and sampling, protocolized and standardized bio-cleaning measures, a
      reorganization of the premises and the definition of specific circuits.

      In view of the second wave of the epidemic, estimating the effectiveness of the barrier
      measures is of major importance. The investigators therefore propose an evaluation of the
      effectiveness of these measures, by comparing the serological prevalence of infection among
      caregivers working directly in COVID units compared to caregivers working in services
      excluding the management of Covid-19 patients.

      Systematic evaluation in COVID-19 units of Sarc-Co-V2 infection will also be assessed, with
      naso-pharyngeal swabs.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  exposed group: exposed caregivers and agents who worked in COVID units (medicine,
             resuscitation, screening) until their date of collection. An exposed agent or
             caregiver is defined by the entrance of rooms with a COVID-19 infection during their
             professional activity.

          -  low or unexposed group: caregivers or agents who have worked in non-COVID units in a
             non-COVID hospital
