      Background:

      People who have had contact with a person with a known SARS-CoV-2 infection are being told to
      self-quarantine for 14 days. This is done to avoid potential virus spread. But the actual
      time it takes for a person to develop an infection after being exposed to the virus is not
      well known. The proper quarantine time could be less or more than 2 weeks. Researchers hope
      this study can be used to help improve public health guidelines for quarantines, social
      distancing, and returning to work after a possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure.

      Objective:

      To better understand how long it takes a person to develop (or not develop) an infection with
      the SARS-CoV-2 virus after they have had contact with a person who has a confirmed infection.

      Eligibility:

      NIH staff members age 18 and older who had recent contact with a person who has a SARS-CoV-2
      infection

      Design:

      Participants will have 3 study visits at the NIH Clinical Center. They may be asked to have
      an extra visit depending on the test results at the third visit.

      At each visit, participants will give a blood and saliva sample. It will be used to test for
      SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Their temperature will be taken. They will complete a short survey to
      collect data about possible COVID-19 symptoms. At the first visit only, they will also
      complete a survey that asks about their recent social contacts.

      Two types of nasal samples will be collected at each visit. These samples will be tested for
      the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

        1. a swab will be inserted deep into the back of the nose &amp;

        2. a swab will be inserted to the middle of your nose.

      Participation lasts 3 to 4 weeks.

      Study Description:

      This is a prospective longitudinal cohort study of contacts of individuals with exposure to
      severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The aim is to correlate results
      of reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using various sample types,
      assays, and culture. We will perform serial screenings of NIH employees who have had contact
      with reported, suspected, or known cases. We will also enroll individuals with previous or
      current infection who are asymptomatic at enrollment. The serial screenings will be done at
      multiple timepoints over 2 days using (RT-PCR) tests of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, saliva
      samples, midturbinate swabs, antibody assays, and culture.

      Objectives:

      Primary Objective:

      Correlate results of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR using various sample types, antibody assays, and
      culture.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. Determine rate of culture positivity in individuals who persistently shed virus.

        2. Determine proportion of individuals who develop asymptomatic infections.

      Endpoints:

      Primary Endpoint:

      Results of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR using NP swab, saliva, and midturbinate swab, antibody assay,
      and culture.

      Secondary Endpoint:

        1. SARS-CoV-2 culture and RT-PCR results.

        2. Symptom checklist.

      Study Population:

      We will enroll up to 1,000 (accrual ceiling: 1,050) adult NIH staff members with exposure to
      SARS-CoV-2, and those with previous or current infections who are asymptomatic at enrollment.

      Facilities Enrolling Participants: NIH CC.

      Study Duration: 3 years.

      Participant Duration: 28 days (with 35 additional extension visits every 2 to 4 weeks until
      the participant has 2 consecutive negative RT-PCR results).
