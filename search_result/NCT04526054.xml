  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Olfactory and gustatory disorders are prevalent symptoms in European COVID-19 patients. This
      study aimed to detect these disturbances among positive COVID-19 patients (symptom not
      initially highlighted by the patient and not sought by caregivers) in order to allow early
      management of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several medical teams have recently shown that disturbances of smell and taste are common and
      can be a precursor and even an isolated sign of COVID-19 involvement. Preliminary results
      suggest the presence of clinical MRI abnormalities, particularly in the olfactory bulbs in
      anosmic patients with COVID-19.

      Anosmia and taste disturbance are early warning signs that could be important in improving
      the detection and diagnosis of COVID-19, and also in monitoring disease. In addition,
      disturbances in smell and taste could be an aid in establishing the prognosis of the clinical
      course of the viral disease. The question of olfactory recovery is also fundamental. To date,
      we do not know the possibilities of recovery from COVID-19 post viral anosmia. ENT exams,
      olfactometry and MRI are proposed to study these phenomena.
