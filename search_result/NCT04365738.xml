      The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of pulmonary rehabilitation(PR) applied
      in the isolation processes of post-acute patients with mild and moderate symptoms who had
      positive COVID-19 test on dyspnea,muscle pain,chest expansion,lower limb muscle strength and
      dynamic balance,fatigue,anxiety and depression.

      This study was conducted with 270 patients who were the COVID-19 test was positive and
      isolated in their homes during post-acute periods.While one of the groups (n=135) was asked
      to remain isolated at home by providing patient education,a PR program was applied for 4
      weeks in addition to the patients in the other group(n=135).PR consists of patient education,
      breathing, in-house mobilization and range of motion exercises.As the evaluation
      parameters,pre-treatment and post-treatment dyspnea levels with Borg scale,muscle pain with
      visual analog scale(VAS),functional capacities with sit-up test,chest expansions with tape
      measure,respiratory frequency,fatigue level with fatigue severity scale,and emotional status
      with hospital anxiety and depression(HAD) scale were evaluated.

    <measure>Dyspnea</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Borg scale is a scale scored between 0-10, indicating the severity of dyspnea. 0 indicates no shortness of breath, 10 indicates severe shortness of breath</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Chest expansion</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Chest expansion was evaluated by measuring the difference between the maximum inspiration and maximum expiration from the level of xsphoid processus of the patients.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue severity scale is a questionnaire consisting of 9 questions showing the degree of fatigue of patients. An average score of less than 2.8 indicates no fatigue, and more than 6.1 indicates chronic fatigue syndrome</description>

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale for pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were instructed and asked to give a score between 0-10 with 0 equating to no pain, 10 indicating severe pain</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital anxiety and depression scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The HAD scale is a short self administered questionnaire used to screen for anxiety and depression. The questionnaire consists of 14 items, seven each measuring anxiety and seven to measure depression. According to research literature, the cut-off point for elevated anxiety and depression as measured by the HAD scale is eight</description>
