  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization (WHO) declared in early 2020 the emergence of a new highly
      contagious SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus responsible for a global public health emergency. In
      France, the first cases of contamination have been reported since the end of January 2020,
      and the first death in mid-February 2020. Then, data published by Public Healh France
      reported an increasing and rapidly exponential number of contaminations. First cases have
      been identified on a cluster mode, then rapidly spreading in some French departments and
      regions, indicating rapid kinetics of virus spread. Given the magnitude of the situation both
      French territory and neighboring European territories (mainly Italy), the government
      mobilized the entire health system to critically manage this epidemic. This exceptional and
      unprecedented pandemic deeply impacted the health structures, disrupting healthcare
      organizations. All caregivers, including all student nurses, actively participated in the
      mobilization and strengthening of care teams. The health crisis exposed the population of
      caregivers to potentially traumatic events which can have major repercussions on their health
      state. The description and identification of the risk factors of the occurrence of post
      traumatic stress disorders in student nurses during the health crisis would allow to provide
      avenues for improving training devices and to facilitate health workers access to specific
      psychological care particularly dedicated to the student nurses population needs.
