    <textblock>
      CovidSurg will capture real-world international data, to determine 30-day mortality in
      patients with COVID-19 infection who undergo surgery. This shared international experience
      will inform the management of this complex group of patients who undergo surgery throughout
      the COVID-19 pandemic, ultimately improving their clinical care.

      There is an urgent need to understand the outcomes of COVID-19 infected patients who undergo
      surgery. Capturing real-world data and sharing international experience will inform the
      management of this complex group of patients who undergo surgery throughout the COVID-19
      pandemic, improving their clinical care.

      The primary aim of the study is to determine 30-day mortality in patients with COVID-19
      infection who undergo surgery. In doing so, this will inform future risk stratification,
      decision making, and patient consent.

      CovidSurg is an investigator-led, non-commercial, non-interventional study is extremely low
      risk, or even zero risk. This study does not collect any patient identifiable information
      (including no dates) and data will not be analysed at hospital-level.
