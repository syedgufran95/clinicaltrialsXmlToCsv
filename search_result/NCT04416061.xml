  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hong Kong public healthcare system is facing tremendous pressure under the COVID-19 pandemic.
      As the virus spread in Hong Kong, Hong Kong Sanatorium &amp; Hospital (HKSH) is one of the first
      private hospitals which immediately provide reliable and rapid COVID-19 test -- Reverse
      Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Early provision of the RT-PCR screening
      test for COVID-19 not only facilitates identification of COVID-19 but also contains the
      spread of the virus in the community and frontline medical staff.

      Since description of role of private hospital in Hong Kong amid COVID-19 pandemic is lacking,
      this study will describe COVID-19 screening algorithm and methodology. A retrospective
      analysis on clinical characteristics, laboratory findings as well as outcome of patients who
      underwent COVID-19 test in HKSH is also performed.
