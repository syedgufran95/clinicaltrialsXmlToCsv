  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VXA-CoV2-1 is a non-replicating Ad5 vector adjuvanted oral tableted vaccine being developed
      to prevent COVID-19, the disease resulting from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus
      (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The study is designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of
      VXA-CoV2-1 vaccine with repeat dosing at multiple dose levels. Safety and immunogenicity will
      be evaluated for up to 12 months after the second dose of VXA-CoV2-1.

      This is an open-label, dose-ranging trial to determine the safety and immunogenicity of an
      orally administered adenoviral-vector based vaccine (VXA-COV2-1) expressing a SARS-CoV-2
      antigen and dsRNA adjuvant. Post screening activities, healthy adult volunteers aged 18 - 54
      yrs old, inclusive, will be enrolled into the study. Participants will receive an oral dose
      of vaccine at Days 1 and 29; total study period will last ~ 2 months during the active phase,
      with a total 12 month safety follow-up period post last vaccination. Safety, reactogenicity
      and immunogenicity assessments will be performed at set times during the study active and
      follow-up periods. Subjects will be monitored for symptoms of COVID-19 throughout the
      duration of the study follow-up period.
