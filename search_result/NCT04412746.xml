  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By Jan 7, 2020, Chinese scientists had isolated a novel coronavirus, from patients with
      virus-infected pneumonia. The WHO designated later this virus as COVID-19 (coronavirus
      disease 2019). This exponential pandemic coronavirus infection is responsible for severe
      forms in 15 to 20%, for critical ill requiring ventilation in 5% and for mortality in 2%.
      Algeria was part of the 13 top priority countries identified by WHO based on their direct
      links and volume of travel to the infected provinces in China.

      It is known that some predisposing conditions lead to a worse outcome with coronavirus.

      In China, the overall case-fatality rate was 2.3%, but was higher in patients with diabetes
      (7.3%). In Italy, the most common comorbidities associated with death from COVID-19 were
      hypertension (73.8%) and diabetes (33.9%). The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
      suggests diabetes is the most common comorbidity in COVID-19 cases. In the largest cohort NHS
      England study, death from COVID-19 was strongly associated with uncontrolled diabetes (after
      full adjustment, HR 2.36).

      The West Algerian CORODIAB-13 study aims is (1) to assess the prevalence of diabetes among
      hospitalized patients with Covid-19, (2) to describe the phenotypic characteristics of
      patients with diabetes, and (3) to identify the parameters specific to the diabetic which are
      associated with severe forms.

      In the future, this study will provide answers for two main questions

        1. Why diabetics are more at risk of developing Covid-19 infection?

        2. Why diabetics are at high risk of developing severe forms?

    <description>MANAGEMENT OF COVID-19 Oxygen therapy to maintain SpO2 target more than 94%. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) at preventive doses. Empirical antibiotic treatment.
Specific treatment for COVID-19 (approved by Algerian Ministry of Health) First line: Hydroxychloroquin: 200 mg oral three times a day for 10 days, with association of Azithromycin 250 mg oral : 500 mg the first day and 250 mg once a day for 4 days. Sulfate de Zinc : 220 mg once a day for 5 days. Second line: Lopinavir/ritonavir capsule 200 mg/50 mg, oral 2 capsules each times, twice a day during 5 to 7 days.
IF AGGRAVATION OR CRITICAL ILL CONDITION AT PRESENTATION Increase oxygenation flow. Consider Glucocorticoids. 3. Consider the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and treat with LMWH at therapeutic doses.
MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES Discontinue metformin. Start or adjust insulin doses according to personalized glycemic target of patient.</description>
