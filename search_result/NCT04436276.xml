    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of
      Ad26.COV2.S at 2 dose levels, administered intramuscularly (IM) as a single-dose or 2-dose
      schedule, with a single booster vaccination administered in one cohort, in healthy adults
      aged greater than or equal to 18 to less than or equal to 55 years and in adults aged greater
      than or equal to 65 years in good health with or without stable underlying conditions.

    <description>Solicited local AEs are pre-defined local (at the injection site) adverse events for which participants are specifically questioned and which are noted by participants in their diary for 7 days after first vaccination. Solicited local AEs are: injection site pain/tenderness, erythema, and swelling at the vaccination site. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product.</description>
