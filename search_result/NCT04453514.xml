  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will help the investigators understand whether it is feasible and acceptable for
      people to practice trauma-informed yoga using a pre-recorded video. This study will also
      explore the immediate effects of trauma-informed yoga on anxiety, mindfulness, and body
      awareness. The results of this study will inform future research on remote delivery of
      trauma-informed yoga for supporting psychological wellbeing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emerging data shows a high prevalence of anxiety during the first several months of the
      COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Accordingly, there have been calls for supportive
      interventions for psychological health during the pandemic. Due to physical distancing
      requirements, supportive interventions for psychological health will be most accessible if
      they can be administered remotely. Trauma-informed yoga may support psychological health
      during the COVID-19 pandemic, but research on remote delivery of trauma-informed yoga is
      needed. The present study will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of trauma-informed
      yoga delivered remotely. In this study, the investigators will create an online delivery
      platform within REDCap, a secure web application for research, that 1) hosts a 45-minute
      video of a trauma-informed yoga practice, and 2) collects data on participants' present
      moment experience of anxiety, mindfulness, and body awareness immediately before and after
      the yoga practice. Feasibility and acceptability data will allow the investigators to
      evaluate recruitment methods and refine the delivery method of trauma-informed yoga in a way
      that aligns with participant preferences. The investigators will also evaluate the short-term
      effects of trauma-informed yoga on state anxiety, state mindfulness, and body awareness. This
      study will allow the investigators to pilot the remote delivery of trauma-informed yoga
      during the ongoing, highly stressful COVID-19 pandemic and further develop trauma-informed
      yoga as a supportive intervention for psychological health.

    <time_frame>immediately before/after</time_frame>
    <description>The State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) - Y6 is a 6-item, validated self-report questionnaire that assesses state anxiety when used with instructions that specify: &quot;indicate how you feel right now, in this moment.&quot; Responses to each item are provided on a 4 point Likert Scale ('Not at all' to 'Very much'). The instrument is scored as the mean of 6 items, multiplied by 20 to use the interpretation guide for the full STAI scale.</description>

    <measure>Mean change in state mindfulness from immediately before to immediately after yoga using the State Mindfulness Scale (State Mindfulness of Mind subscale)</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately before/after</time_frame>
    <description>The State Mindfulness Scale is a 21-item, validated self-report questionnaire that assesses state mindfulness. The State Mindfulness Scale is comprised of two subscales, State Mindfulness of Mind and State Mindfulness of Body. Responses to each item are provided on a 5 point Likert Scale ('Not at all' to 'Very much'). The instrument is scored as the sum of scores from each subscale. For this outcome, the State Mindfulness of Mind subscale will be used.</description>
