    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to investigate the feasibility of using Hexoskin cardiorespiratory and
      activity data, as well as patient symptomatology, to provide an AI model for disease
      progression that will be at the service of the clinical team to recommend the best customized
      and evolving care trajectory for each patient.

      The following protocol proposes a mixed methods pilot study, whereby the immediate purpose is
      to generate quantifiable information regarding the feasibility of a virtual trial with the
      Hexoskin Platform, collection of data quality in COVID-19 patients, and values for algorithm
      construction. In essence, sixteen participants with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis will be
      invited to wear the Hexoskin biometric garment during the course of several hours per week,
      over a period of 28 days. In addition to the biometric data collection, participants will be
      invited to complete four questionnaires. The biometric data will be combined to the
      sociodemographic information and patient symptomatology to construct an algorithm which can
      accurately predict patient outcomes.

          -  Access to a measuring tape

          -  Experiencing at least three of the following COVID-19 symptoms (fever, cough,
             difficulty breathing, intense fatigue, sudden loss of smell and/or taste without nasal
             congestion, sore throat, headache, aching muscles, loss of appetite, diarrhea).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hexoskin should not be used by people with allergies to the following materials:
             polyester, synthetic fibers. Usage must be stopped if the product causes skin
             irritation or rashes.

          -  Hexoskin should not be used by people with Pacemakers or Implantable
             Cardioverter-Defibrillator (ICD) devices.

          -  Hexoskin must not be used simultaneously with a Holter Monitor, as the equipment would
             interfere with the placement of the Hexoskin sensors.

          -  Hexoskin must not be used in an MRI machine as it contains metallic parts.
