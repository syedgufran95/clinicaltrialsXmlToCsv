  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out if CCP is safe and to determine the safest
      and most effective level of anti-viral antibody when given to people admitted to the hospital
      with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Participants enrolled on this study will be transfused
      with 2 units of CCP through an IV. These units will be given one at a time 4 to 24 hours
      apart. Participants will be randomized to receive either 2 units with standard antibody
      levels as recommended by the FDA or 2 units with an antibody level higher than that
      recommended by the FDA. This study is experimental and CCP is investigational and has not
      been approved by the FDA for the treatment of COVID-19. The CCP is collected per FDA
      guidelines from persons recovered from COVID-19 infection. The plasma contains antibodies and
      possibly other properties that inhibit the virus. The investigators do not know if the level
      of antibodies present in the CCP will make a difference in how the participant's body is able
      to fight the infection and hope to learn that in this study.

      This randomized, double-blinded, phase 2 trial will assess the efficacy and safety of
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma in hospitalized patients with less than 8 days of
      symptoms. Eligible participants will receive institutional-guided standard-of-care (SOC) and
      ABO-compatible convalescent COVID-19 plasma (CCP). The CCP units will be tested for the
      presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and pre-assigned as high-titer (CCP1) or
      standard-titer (CCP2) in a 1:1 randomization. Participants and clinical investigators will be
      blinded to the CCP titer group identities.

      The investigators plan to enroll approximately 56 participants (28 in each group) at
      UNC-Chapel Hill. Participants will be randomized within 48 hours of admission to a COVID
      service and will receive convalescent plasma within 24 hours of randomization. At least two
      units of CCP will be transfused 4-24 hours apart on study Day 0. If available, a third unit
      may be administered. All participants will undergo a series of safety and efficacy
      assessments pre-, during, and post-transfusion. Samples for research will be collected on Day
      0 through Day 28, unless previously discharged. Additionally, after discharge, participants
      can provide longitudinal samples collected at 1, 3, and 6-month timepoints after the
      infusion.

    <description>Total number of SAEs among all participants at Day 14; Definition of SAE per protocol and will only be included if related to CCP: 1. Death. 2. Life-threatening (immediate risk of death). 3. Prolongation of existing hospitalization. 4. Persistent or significant disability or incapacity. OR 5. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require intervention or escalation of care may be considered a serious adverse event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization.</description>
