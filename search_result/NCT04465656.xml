  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study COVID-EP is to classify all the complications occurring after the
      diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in patients tested initially COVID-19 positive and negative
      by RT-PCR (on nasopharyngeal sample) during the peak of the pandemic in France (April 2020).
      The patients will be followed for 1 year in order to provide clinical and paraclinical data
      not yet published in the literature. In order to secondarily confirm the COVID-19 status of
      initially negative COVID-19 patients (by RT-PCR), a serology test will be performed. The
      collected complications will then be compared between each of the 3 following groups:
      [PCR-COVID 19-Neg &amp; Sero-COVID 19-Neg] versus [PCR-COVID 19-Neg &amp; Sero-COVID 19-Pos] versus
      [PCR-COVID 19-Pos].
