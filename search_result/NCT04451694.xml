  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus infection is responsible for muscle wasting (sarcopenia), especially during
      prolonged stays in intensive care. Sarcopenia, in its functional aspect also seems major in
      patients hospitalized for this infection, in non-ICU unit. Weight loss also appears to be
      significant, despite a prevalence of overweight and obesity in severe forms. Undernutrition
      in the obese patient is also possible (undernourished obese and sarcopenia obesity). Anosmia
      and dysgeusia participate in undernutrition by reducing energy intake. The rehabilitation of
      these patients requires nutritional support (increased protein intake) associated with
      progressive retraining to physical activity.

      An early and proactive management procedure within Coronavirus disease-19 units has been
      implemented in conjunction with the Transversal Nutrition Unit (TNU). This nutritional care
      must be continued after discharge. Follow-up by teleconsultation or telephone consultation is
      put in place after the patient's discharge Primary Objective: Evaluation of nutritional
      status at the time of admission and discharge and home follow-up in outgoing patients from
      Coronavirus disease-19 Units Secondary objectives: Description of the evolution of food
      intake, diversity of food and coverage of needs Evaluation of the muscular strength of the
      wrist (by grip test in hospital) and on the arms and legs after return home (visual analog
      scale) Evolution of anosmia and dysgeusia (at the time of hospital admission, at the time of
      hospital discharge and at home) Level of physical training before infection (IPAQ)
      Description of the general state of health measured by the performance index - world health
      organization scale Description of nutritional prescriptions Description of the prevention
      measures and incidence of Inappropriate Refeeding Syndrome (IRS) Care needs assessments
