    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter,
      dose escalation and proof of concept study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      razuprotafib subcutaneously administered three times daily (TID) in hospitalized subjects
      with moderate to severe COVID-19. Part 1 of the study is a 2-step dose escalation period
      conducted in approximately 60 subjects. Part 2 is a safety and efficacy period evaluating
      razuprotafib doses selected from Part 1 and will be conducted in approximately 120 subjects.
      Subjects will receive razuprotafib or placebo TID for 7 days or until discharge from the
      hospital (or death) and will be evaluated for safety and efficacy through Day 28. The effects
      of razuprotafib on biomarkers of coagulation, inflammation and vascular leakage will also be
      evaluated.

             treatment;

         11. Decision to withhold life-sustaining treatment; Note: In the event of cardiac arrest,
             the decision to withhold cardiopulmonary resuscitation only does not fulfill this
             exclusion criterion.

         12. Use of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 substrates (eg, repaglinide, paclitaxel, or
             cerivastatin) or CYP3A4 substrates (eg, amlodipine, budesonide, dasabuvir,
             enzalutamide, imatinib, lopinavir, loperamide, saquinavir, sildenafil, midazolam, or
             montelukast);

         13. Use of CYP2C8 inhibitors (eg, gemfibrozil, fluvoxamine, or ketoconazole);

         14. Participation in another investigational study during the present study through the
