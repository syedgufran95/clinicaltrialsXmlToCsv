  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter,
      dose escalation and proof of concept study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      razuprotafib subcutaneously administered three times daily (TID) in hospitalized subjects
      with moderate to severe COVID-19. Part 1 of the study is a 2-step dose escalation period
      conducted in approximately 60 subjects. Part 2 is a safety and efficacy period evaluating
      razuprotafib doses selected from Part 1 and will be conducted in approximately 120 subjects.
      Subjects will receive razuprotafib or placebo TID for 7 days or until discharge from the
      hospital (or death) and will be evaluated for safety and efficacy through Day 28. The effects
      of razuprotafib on biomarkers of coagulation, inflammation and vascular leakage will also be
      evaluated.

          4. Females of childbearing potential must be willing to completely abstain or agree to
             use a highly effective method of contraception through Day 28; and have a negative

             suggestive of severe systemic illness with COVID-19, which could include any symptom
             of moderate illness, shortness of breath at rest, or respiratory distress, and
             respiratory rate at 30 or greater breaths/min, heart rate at 125 or greater beats/min,
             or SpO2 &gt;93% on room air at sea level or PaO2:FiO2 &lt;300.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inability to initiate study drug within 12 hours after randomization;

          2. Female of childbearing potential who is unable or unwilling to forego breastfeeding

             delivered oxygen of 0.5 or greater), noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, or
             extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); or have a clinical diagnosis of

             limit of normal (ULN);

          7. Total bilirubin &gt;2 × ULN;

          8. Estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;30 mL/min or receiving hemodialysis or
             hemofiltration;

          9. Moribund subject not expected to survive 24 hours in the opinion of the treating

             treatment;

         11. Decision to withhold life-sustaining treatment; Note: In the event of cardiac arrest,
             the decision to withhold cardiopulmonary resuscitation only does not fulfill this
             exclusion criterion.

         12. Use of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 substrates (eg, repaglinide, paclitaxel, or
             cerivastatin) or CYP3A4 substrates (eg, amlodipine, budesonide, dasabuvir,
             enzalutamide, imatinib, lopinavir, loperamide, saquinavir, sildenafil, midazolam, or
             montelukast);

         13. Use of CYP2C8 inhibitors (eg, gemfibrozil, fluvoxamine, or ketoconazole);

         14. Participation in another investigational study during the present study through the
             last visit (Day 28); or

         15. Previous randomization in this study.
