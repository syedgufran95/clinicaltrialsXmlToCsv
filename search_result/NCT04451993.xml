  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As long as the people stay at home because of the Covid 19 outbreak, the investigators assume
      that the sleep quality of OUAS patients, like everyone else, and the sleep quality of
      COVID-19 outbreak are reduced due to anxiety and anxiety in people. In addition, we assume
      that sleep quality and physical activity level are related to health literacy level and fear
      of movement (kinesiophobia). In this study; the investigators aimed to determine how patients
      are affected by this process by evaluating sleep quality, physical activity, fear of movement
      and health literacy in OSAS patients during our stay in the COVID-19 outbreak.

    <textblock>
      Research Ahi Evren Chest Cardiovascular Surgery Training Research Hospital will be performed
      in patients between the ages of 18-70 years, diagnosed with OSAS in the sleep laboratory.
      Sleep quality, physical activity, fear of movement and health literacy will be evaluated in
      OSAS patients. Evaluations will be made by phone In order for the study to be strong, it will
      be tried to reach the maximum patient that can be taken between June 2020 and October 2020.

    <description>International Physical Activity Questionnaire/ In activity-specific scoring, walking under the heading of the fields is calculated by the sum of the moderate intensity activity and intensive activity in itself.
From these calculations, a score is obtained in MET-minutes. There are 3 categories of physical activity level classification. Physical activity levels are classified as physically inactive (inactive), low level of physical activity (minimally active) and sufficient level of physical activity (very active)</description>

    <description>In order to measure the general sleepiness of people during the day, it was evaluated with a standard questionnaire, which is defined as Epworth sleepiness scale (EUS) and consists of 8 questions. The answers for each question are scored between 0 and 3 and the total score is obtained. The score obtained above 10 in EUS has high sensitivity and specificity for daytime sleepiness.</description>
