  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 infected pregnant women is thought to have variable degrees of inflammatory response
      against the disease. Investigators of present study, suggested that fetuses are affected from
      the possible fetal inflammatory syndrome in case of maternal COVID-19. Therefore the aim of
      his study is to evaluate that if the cardiothymic index is affected by the maternal COVID-19
      and to demonstrate any possible association of this measurement with neonatal morbidities.

      COVID-19 infected pregnant women is thought to have variable degrees of inflammatory response
      against the disease. Fetus is known to be influenced by maternal systemic infections. Thymus
      size of fetus and the neonate, is proven to be changed by primarily inflammatory/infectious
      diseases. Investigators of present study, suggested that fetuses are affected from the
      possible fetal inflammatory syndrome in case of maternal COVID-19. Therefore the aim of his
      study is to evaluate that if the cardiothymic index is affected by the maternal COVID-19 and
      to demonstrate any possible association of this measurement with neonatal morbidities.
