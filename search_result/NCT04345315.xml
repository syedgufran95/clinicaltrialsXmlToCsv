  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Translational, prospective / retrospective, non-profit, non-pharmacological study, with
      cohort characteristics.

      The study consists of two parts: the first to study epidemiological aspects of the spread of
      the disease and the second one to identify infection-related genetic factors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The outbreak of COVID-19 infections is spreading in Italy with unprecedented severity
      characteristics. In this context, it is essential to collect data relating to the
      epidemiology of the disease, to outline further useful tools for diagnosis and to define the
      correct use of rapid molecular and / or serological tests in the surveillance of high-risk
      subjects (cancer patients and healthcare operators), in order to identify any new disease
      control strategies, crucial to reduce the transmission and to outline specific guidelines for
      cancer patients healthcare management. It is also necessary to identify the factors that
      determine the evolution of the viral genome over time in the various geographical areas and
      also the potential susceptibility markers in the different types of affected subjects
      (symptomatic, mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic).

        For epidemiologic analysis, asymptomatic population 350 health workers / healthy subjects
        at risk of infection and 50 cancer patients candidates for immunosuppressive therapies will
        be enrolled.

        For analysis of genetic variability of virus and host factors impacting on susceptibility
        to infection: samples from about 100 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (sintomatic,
        paucisintomatic or asymptomatic), retained at Pievesestina Laboratory after diagnostic
        procedure, will be analyzed. All samples for genetic analysis will be anonymized.
