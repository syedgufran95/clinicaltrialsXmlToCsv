  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 infection has spread worldwide causing several deaths in few months Convalescent
      Plasma from COVID 19 donors has shown huge activity in small series from Chinese patients and
      currently many centers from USA and the European Union are assessing its use looking to avoid
      mortality and prolonged hospitalizations COVID-19-related

      This is a collaborative, 4 arms , non randomized clinical trial assessing the use of
      Convalescent Plasma from COVID-19 recovered donors to be used in oncological and
      non-oncological patients with current severe COVID-19 infection or in patients with risk
      factors of major complications secondary to COVID-19 infection
