  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has a quoted inpatient mortality as high as 25%. This
      high mortality may be driven by hyperinflammation resembling cytokine release syndrome (CRS),
      offering the hope that therapies targeting the interleukin-6 (IL-6) axis therapies commonly
      used to treat CRS can be used to reduce COVID-19 mortality. Retrospective analysis of severe
      to critical COVID-19 patients receiving tocilizumab demonstrated that the majority of
      patients had rapid resolution (i.e., within 24-72 hours following administration) of both
      clinical and biochemical signs (fever and CRP, respectively) of hyperinflammation with only a
      single tocilizumab dose.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Tocilizumab is effective in decreasing signs, symptoms, and laboratory evidence of
           COVID-19 pneumonitis in hospitalized, non-critically ill patients with clinical risk
           factors for clinical decompensation, intensive care utilization, and death.

        2. Low-dose tocilizumab is effective in decreasing signs, symptoms, and laboratory evidence
           of COVID-19 pneumonitis in hospitalized, non-critically ill patients with and without
           clinical risk factors for clinical decompensation, intensive care utilization, and
           death.

      Objectives:

        1. To establish proof of concept that tocilizumab is effective in decreasing signs,
           symptoms, and laboratory evidence of COVID-19 pneumonitis in hospitalized,
           non-critically ill patients with clinical risk factors for clinical decompensation,
           intensive care utilization, and death, as determined by the clinical outcome of
           resolution of fever and the biochemical outcome measures of time to CRP normalization
           for the individual patient and the rate of patients whose CRP normalize.

        2. To establish proof of concept that low-dose tocilizumab is effective in decreasing
           signs, symptoms, and laboratory evidence of COVID-19 pneumonitis in hospitalized,
           non-critically ill patients without clinical risk factors for clinical decompensation,
           intensive care utilization, and death, as determined by the clinical outcome of
           resolution of fever and the biochemical outcome measures of time to CRP normalization
           for the individual patient and the rate of patients whose CRP normalize.

This diagnosis will be determined by treating physicians on the basis of worsening pulmonary infiltrates on chest imaging as well as clinical deterioration marked by persistent fever, rising supplemental oxygen requirement, declining PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and the need for intensive care such as mechanical ventilation or vasopressor/inotrope medication(s).</description>

    <measure>Number of ICU days</measure>
    <time_frame>Hospitalization, up to 4 weeks after tocilizumab administration</time_frame>
    <description>Number of ICU days is defined as the time period when a patient is admitted to the ICU (defined as the timestamp on the first vital signs collected in an ICU) until they are transferred from the ICU to a non-ICU setting such as a general acute care bed (defined as the timestamp on the first vital signs collected outside an ICU, excepting any &quot;off the floor&quot; vital signs charted from operating rooms or procedure or imaging suites). Death in the ICU will be a competing risk.</description>
