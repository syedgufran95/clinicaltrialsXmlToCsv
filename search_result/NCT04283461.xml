    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, dose-ranging clinical trial in males and non-pregnant females,
      starting at 18 years of age, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all eligibility
      criteria. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and
      immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 manufactured by ModernaTX, Inc. mRNA-1273 is a novel lipid
      nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes for a full-length, prefusion
      stabilized spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Enrollment will occur at up to 3 domestic
      clinical research sites. One hundred and fifty-five subjects will be enrolled into one of
      thirteen cohorts (10 micrograms [mcg], 25 mcg, 50 mcg, 100 mcg, and 250 mcg). Subjects will
      receive an intramuscular (IM) injection (0.5 milliliters [mL]) of mRNA-1273 on Days 1 and 29
      in the deltoid muscle and will be followed through 12 months post second vaccination (Day
      394). Follow-up visits will occur 1, 2, and 4 weeks post each vaccination (Days 8, 15, 29,
      36, 43, and 57), as well as 3, 6, and 12 months post second vaccination (Days 119, 209, and
      394). The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a 2-dose
      vaccination schedule of mRNA-1273, given 28 days apart, across 5 dosages in healthy adults.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity as measured by Immunoglobulin G
      (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to the SARS-CoV-2 S (spike) protein following
      a 2-dose vaccination schedule of mRNA-1273 at Day 57.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        A subject must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible to participate in this
        study:

          1. Provides written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures.

          2. Be able to understand and agrees to comply with planned study procedures and be
             available for all study visits.

          3. Agrees to the collection of venous blood per protocol.

          4. Male or non-pregnant female, &gt;/= to 18 years of age at time of enrollment.

          5. Body Mass Index (BMI) 18.0-35.0 kg/m^2, inclusive (&lt; 56 years of age), at screening;
             BMI 18.0-30.0 kg/m^2, inclusive (&gt;/= 56 years of age), at screening.

          6. Women of childbearing potential* must agree to use or have practiced true abstinence**
             or use at least one acceptable primary form of contraception.***, **** Note: These
             criteria are applicable to females in a heterosexual relationship and child-bearing
             potential (i.e., the criteria do not apply to subjects in a same sex relationship).

               -  Not of childbearing potential - post-menopausal females (defined as having a
                  history of amenorrhea for at least one year) or a documented status as being
                  surgically sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, tubal
                  ligation/salpingectomy, or Essure(R) placement).

                    -  True abstinence is 100% of time no sexual intercourse (male's penis enters
                       the female's vagina). (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation,
                       symptothermal, post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable
                       methods of contraception).

                         -  Acceptable forms of primary contraception include monogamous
                            relationship with a vasectomized partner who has been vasectomized for
                            180 days or more prior to the subject's first vaccination, intrauterine
                            devices, birth control pills, and injectable/implantable/insertable
                            hormonal birth control products.

                              -  Must use at least one acceptable primary form of contraception for
                                 at least 30 days prior to the first vaccination and at least one
                                 acceptable primary form of contraception for 60 days after the
                                 last vaccination.

          7. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test
             within 24 hours prior to each vaccination.

          8. Male subjects of childbearing potential*: use of condoms to ensure effective
             contraception with a female partner of childbearing potential from first vaccination
             until 60 days after the last vaccination.

             *Biological males who are post-pubertal and considered fertile until permanently
             sterile by bilateral orchiectomy or vasectomy.

          9. Male subjects agree to refrain from sperm donation from the time of first vaccination
             until 60 days after the last vaccination.

         10. In good health.*

             *As determined by medical history and physical examination to evaluate acute or
             ongoing chronic medical diagnoses/conditions that have been present for at least 90
             days, which would affect the assessment of safety of subjects. Chronic medical
             diagnoses/conditions should be stable for the last 60 days (no hospitalizations,
             emergency room (ER), or urgent care for condition or need for supplemental oxygen).
             This includes no change in chronic prescription medication, dose, or frequency as a
             result of deterioration of the chronic medical diagnosis/condition in the 60 days
             before enrollment. Any prescription change that is due to change of health care
             provider, insurance company, etc., or done for financial reasons, and in the same
             class of medication, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion.
             Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as
             determined by the participating site principal investigator (PI) or appropriate
             sub-investigator, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion.
             Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the
             participating site PI or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to
             subject safety or assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity, and do not indicate
             a worsening of medical diagnosis/condition. Similarly, medication changes subsequent
             to enrollment and study vaccination are acceptable provided the change was not
             precipitated by deterioration in the chronic medical condition, and there is no
             anticipated additional risk to the subject or interference with the evaluation of
             responses to study vaccination.

         11. Oral temperature is less than 100.0 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius).

         12. Pulse no greater than 100 beats per minute.

         13. Systolic blood pressure (BP) is 85 to 150 mm Hg, inclusive.

         14. Clinical screening laboratory evaluations (white blood cell (WBC), hemoglobin (Hgb),
             platelets (PLTs), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), creatinine
             (Cr), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin (T. Bili), Lipase, prothrombin time
             (PT), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT)) are within acceptable normal reference
             ranges at the clinical laboratory being used.

         15. Must agree to have samples stored for secondary research.

         16. Agrees to adhere to Lifestyle Considerations throughout study duration.

         17. Must agree to refrain from donating blood or plasma during the study (outside of this
             study).

        Leukapheresis Inclusion Criteria:

        A subject must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for leukapheresis:

          1. Written informed consent for leukapheresis is provided.

          2. Weight &gt;/= 110 pounds.

          3. Screening laboratory evaluations are within acceptable ranges at the site where the
             leukapheresis procedure will be performed.

          4. Negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 48 hours of the leukapheresis procedure
             for women of childbearing potential.

             completed the two-dose vaccination series.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A subject who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in
        this study:

          1. Positive pregnancy test either at screening or just prior to each vaccine
             administration.

          3. Has any medical disease or condition that, in the opinion of the participating site
             principal investigator (PI) or appropriate sub-investigator, precludes study
             participation.*

             *Including acute, subacute, intermittent or chronic medical disease or condition that
             would place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury, render the subject unable
             to meet the requirements of the protocol, or may interfere with the evaluation of
             responses or the subject's successful completion of this trial.

          4. Presence of self-reported or medically documented significant medical or psychiatric
             condition(s).*
