  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Model School Pediatric Health Initiative arose out of concern about health access
      inequities and disparities among some of Toronto's most vulnerable children living in our
      inner-city neighborhoods. It is well documented that illness, emotional difficulties and
      self-esteem impacts a variety of educational markers including school attendance and
      performance. Providing health care in schools may be the most direct and efficient way to
      ensure that all children have access to the care they need including diagnosis, management
      and follow up of multiple health and school related concerns. American research has
      demonstrated that inner city children who had access to an elementary school-based health
      clinic (SBHC) had less difficulty receiving treatment for illnesses and injuries,
      immunizations, and physical examinations. In addition, rates of enrolment and utilization of
      elementary SBHCs are higher in those children who traditionally have poorer access to health
      care. Given the vast differences in the Canadian and American health systems it is important
      to evaluate SBHCs in Canada before long-term implementation.

      The objective of this study is to collect data including demographic characteristics and
      clinical features of students attending a SHBC at five selected sites in Toronto. In light of
      the COVID-19 pandemic, the research team is additionally interested in asking about families'
      experiences with the pandemic and school closures. It is hypothesized, that these vulnerable
      children who come from lower income families and/or are newcomers to Canada attending these
      SHBCs, are likely to experience more mental health symptoms with the heightened uncertainty
      surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.

      This study will be a prospective chart review design. A COVID-19 questionnaire will be
      constructed and administered online at three time points: baseline, 6 months upon completion
      of the baseline questionnaire, and 12 months upon completion of the baseline questionnaire.
