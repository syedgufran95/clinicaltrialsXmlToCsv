  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plasma, the supernatant part of blood, contains a variety of different proteins, including
      immunoglobulins. These proteins, also called antibodies, are directed to previous foreign
      infecting organisms, such as virus, bacteria or parasites. Patients recovering from
      SARS-Cov-2 infection may develop protective antibodies which can prevent reinfection with the
      same agent or similar organisms with shared molecular structures. Those antibodies may be
      transferred to other patients through collection of such convalescent plasma from recovered
      donors and its transfusion to ill patients. In this research, the primary hypothesis is that
      those antibodies can exert passive immunization and help ameliorate symptoms from COVID-19
      (Coronavirus Disease 2019), resulting in higher clinical improvement rates at day 28,
      especially when administered early in the infection course.

      This is a randomized, open-label, phase 3 clinical trial on the use of convalescent plasma
      for severe COVID-19 patients. In this research, we are going to assess efficacy and safety of
      convalescent plasma in the treatment of severely compromised COVID-19 patients. Convalescent
      plasma will be collected from recovered COVID-19 patients, who will be recruited as plasma
      donors and will be submitted to apheresis (with minimum interval of 14 days) to obtain two
      aliquots of 300 ml of convalescent plasma, which will be frozen at -80 and stored at -20 to
      -30 degrees Celsius. Enrolled patients will be randomized based on a concealed sequential
      allocation list by an independent researcher which will not be aware of patients
      characteristics, and stratified by COVID-19 severity (severe or life-threatening). There will
      be two arms of study, intervention or control group, and patients will be followed up for the
      next 28 days for clinical and laboratory outcomes such as improvement of disease status
      (measured by a 6-point ordinal severity scale); mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit
      (ICU) and total hospital stay period; cytokine levels (IL-6 and TNF-alfa) and several
      inflammatory, cellular injury and coagulation parameters. Intervention was conceived as two
      infusions of 300 ml of convalescent plasma, 2 days apart. Control group will receive full
      supportive treatment but will not be allowed to receive other investigational drugs. Sample
      size was calculated to a total of 160 patients, with a 1:1 randomization proportion between
      groups. This amount would be capable to detect an 18% or higher difference in the proportion
      of clinical improvement at 28 days of enrollment between intervention and control groups,
      with an alfa error of 0.05 and a statistical power of 0.8.
