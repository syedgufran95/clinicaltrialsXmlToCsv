  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a total of 80 patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
      infection will be randomized to receive Duvelisib or a placebo. Participants will be enrolled
      at Emory University Hospital and at the University of Pennsylvania and will be identified and
      recruited by their treating physician and research team.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized placebo-controlled phase 2 study will evaluate whether a two-week exposure to
      duvelisib, a gamma/delta phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, reduces inflammation in
      the lungs in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
      infection and COVID-19 who do not require mechanical ventilation at study initiation. The
      primary objective of the study is to determine the efficacy of duvelisib treatment in
      preventing death or the need for mechanical ventilation among patients with World Health
      Organization (WHO)-defined severe COVID-19. Key secondary endpoints will be reductions in
      oxygen requirements of patients and improvements in their performance status, safety and
      tolerability of duvelisib in the setting of COVID-19, biomarkers of inflammation, duration of
      viremia, and generation of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody
      responses to SARS-Cov-2 spike protein. The study will determine if a two-week exposure to
      duvelisib beginning soon after presentation with severe COVID-19 warrants further evaluation
      in a larger clinical study.

Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 5. Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care (COVID-19 related or otherwise); 6.

             3 times ULN.

          -  The effects of duvelisib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,
             women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine
             pr5egnancy test prior to starting therapy. WOCBP and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) from
             enrollment into this study until at least 60 days after the first dose of duvelisib. A
             woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not
             undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally
             postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in
             the preceding 24 consecutive months. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform
             her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study
             participation, and 2 months after completion of duvelisib administration. WOCBP must
             have a negative pregnancy test within 24 hours of the first dose of duvelisib.

          -  The patient must be willing to comply with fertility requirements as below:

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the usual practice and lifestyle of
                  the patient) will be accepted. Periodic abstinence (i.e., calendar, ovulation,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawals are not acceptable forms

               -  If a female participant is of reproductive potential, the participant (and her
                  partner) must agree to use of one of the following combinations of birth control
                  during the study and for 2 months after the last dose of study drug (or tubal
                  ligation as a single method):

                    -  Use of a double-barrier method of contraception: condoms (male or female)
                       and a diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide;

                    -  Use of an IUD and a barrier method: condoms (male or female, with or without
                       spermicide) or a diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide;

                    -  Tubal ligation.

               -  Women who are post-menopausal, defined as age greater than 45 and no menses for
                  at least 24 consecutive months, or who have had a hysterectomy, are considered
                  not of reproductive potential.

               -  Males must agree to using contraception during the study and for 2 months after
                  the last dose of study drug or have undergone a male sterilization procedure (at
                  least 6 months prior to screening.

               -  Use of oral (estrogen and progesterone), injected or implanted hormonal methods
                  of contraception, or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine
                  system (IUS) or other forms of contraception that comparable efficacy (failure
                  rate &lt;1%). In case of oral contraception, the woman should be stable on the same
                  pill for a minimum of 3 months prior to enrollment on the study.

          -  Patients must agree not to donate blood, sperm/ova or any other organs while taking
             protocol therapy and for at least 2 weeks after stopping treatment.

          -  Willingness and ability of the patient to comply with scheduled visits, drug
             administration plan, protocol specified laboratory tests, other study procedures and
             study restrictions

          -  Evidence of personally signed informed consent indicating that the subject is aware of
             the life-threatening nature of the disease and has been informed on the procedures to
             be followed, the experimental nature of the therapy, alternative, potential risks and
             discomforts, potential benefits and other pertinent aspects of study participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients requiring mechanical ventilation (intubation or Bi-PAP) at the time
             randomization.

          -  Patients receiving any investigational drugs other than drugs or therapies to treat
             COVID-19, with the exception of investigational immune-modulatory drugs as per section
             5.4.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because duvelisib is agent with the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with duvelisib, breastfeeding should be discontinued before starting study drug
             and breastfeeding should not be resumed until at least 1 month after last dose of
             study drug.

          -  Clinical suspicion that the etiology of acute illness (acute decompensation) is
             primarily due to a condition other than COVID-19

          -  Known contraindication to duvelisib

          -  Patients with hepatic cirrhosis as defined by symptomatic liver dysfunction; liver
             fibrosis by biopsy; ALT &gt; 5 times ULN, AST&gt; 5 times ULN, or bilirubin &gt; 3 times ULN.

          -  Patients with autoimmune diseases or patients on chronic immunosuppressive medications
             at the time of hospital admission or screening.
