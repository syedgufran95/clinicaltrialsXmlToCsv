  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about the effects of a medicine called ruxolitinib on the
      progression of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease of 2019), the medical condition caused by the
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Ruxolitinib is FDA-approved for
      the treatment of myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, and graft-versus-host disease. This study
      intends to define the impact of ruxolitinib on the severity and progression of COVID-19. This
      drug might to lower the hyperinflammation caused by the virus, which would prevent damage to
      the lungs and possibly other organs.

      The study will recruit patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-19.

      The goal is to recruit 80 patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an adaptive Phase 2/3 clinical trial, with a focus on the assessment of safety in the
      first 20 participants (Phase 2), followed by a much broader assessment of efficacy, while
      continuing to monitor safety, in an additional 60 participants (Phase 3, total participants
      across Phase 2/3 n=80). Both phases are single arm, open label, and occur at a single site at
      the University of Colorado Hospital (UCH). Data from participants in this study will be
      compared with data from other COVID-19 patients not receiving ruxolitinib. Study participants
      will receive 10 mg twice daily of ruxolitinib for 14 days and will be followed for up to 29
      days.

    <description>Grade 3 AEs are defined as events that interrupt usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. Severe events are usually incapacitating. Grade 4 AEs are defined as events that are potentially life threatening. AEs will be collected and graded daily and cumulative incidence will be reported.</description>

    <description>This study is an Adaptive Phase 2/3 trial designed to test the safety (Phase 2) and efficacy (Phase 2 and 3) of ruxolitinib to treat COVID-19. Phase 2 consists of a single-arm, open-label assignment of 20 participants receiving 10 mg ruxolitinib twice daily for 14 days. Phase 3 consists of a single-arm, open-label assignment of 60 additional participants receiving ruxolitinib at the same dose. In both phases, participants will be monitored daily while hospitalized for 29 days, or until discharge, whichever occurs first. Participants who are discharged will be followed up with via phone on Day 15 and Day 29.</description>

          -  Provides informed consent signed by study patient or legally acceptable representative

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Absolute platelet counts are less than 75 x 10^9/L

          -  Absolute neutrophil count is less than 0.5 x 10^9/L

          -  Hemoglobin is less than 8 g/dL

          -  Severe renal impairment defined by serum creatinine greater than 2 mg/dL or CrCl less
             than 30 mL/min

          -  Treatment with other JAK inhibitors, strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, biologic
             disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs, including anti-IL-6 or anti-IL-6R
             antibodies), or potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine
             concurrently or within the past 5 days. Note: recent or concurrent treatment with
             hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine is allowable, as these are 'non-biologic' DMARDs
             with potential antiviral activity.

          -  History of HIV infection and on active immunosuppressant therapy

          -  Current hematological or solid organ malignancy and on active immunosuppressant
             therapy

          -  Active tuberculosis (TB) infection or known or suspected systemic bacterial or fungal
             infection

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding

          -  Known allergy to ruxolitinib

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, they are unlikely to survive for &gt;48 hours from
             screening

          -  Any physical examination findings and/or history of any illness that, in the opinion
             of the investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose an additional
             risk to the patient by their participation in the study

        Additional Exclusion Criteria for Phase 2 only:

          -  Invasive oxygen supplementation, including mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal
             membrane oxygenation (ECMO)
