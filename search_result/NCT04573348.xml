  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The analysis method described in this protocol is a novel simple plausible immunological
      approach which is non-invasive, high throughput, real-time quantitative monitoring of
      metabolic activity (MA) profiles of fresh Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) in
      response to various reagents at different concentrations. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the T cells reactivity to SARS COV 2 immunogenic selected peptides by Metabolic
      Activity Method in convalesce and healthy individuals and to compare it with Antibody
      response (ELISA) and clinical information

      This is a prospective, four groups, open, comparative, controlled study. A total of 400
      completed, evaluated subjects will be enrolled in this study. Main Study Measures: Reactivity
      of T cells to selected SARS COV-2 peptides by MA test and IgG Antibody response to SARS COV-2
      by commercial ELISA test.

      Study Procedures:

        -  Screening

        -  Informed consent signing

        -  Medical history review

        -  Blood collection.

        -  MA test and ELISA test will be performed at Savicell's Laboratory site.

        Group 1 :COVID -19 convalesce individuals that tested positive to COVID -19 by swab PCR
        test who were severe/acute/moderate - ill with hospitalization/drug treatment/ breathing
        support and who have passed one months or more since recovering from COVID-19 illness Group
        2:Belong to family members who shared a household with donors in group 1 and were exposed
        at the time of symptomatic disease, without any diagnoses of COVID-19 and tested PCR
        negative to COVID-19. Group 3:COVID - 19 convalesce individuals that tested positive to
        COVID -19 by swab PCR test who were mild or asymptomatic and who have passed more than two
        weeks since recovering from illness. Group 4:COVID - 19 healthy blood donors that keep
