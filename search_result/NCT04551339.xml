      The purpose of this research study is to look at high dose zinc versus multivitamin
      micronutrient supplementation to support immune health in the setting of the COVID-19
      pandemic.

      This is a two-cohort prospective randomized study intended to test the role of Zinc versus
      multivitamin supplementation in supporting immune health in the setting of the COVID-19
      pandemic. Individuals over 50 years old or primary health care professionals over the age of
      18 who have had no evidence of prior COVID-19 infection and who have been asymptomatic for 7
      days prior to enrollment will be randomized at the individual level to take either
      PreserVision AREDS formulation with 69.6mg/day Zinc supplementation or to receive a Centrum
      Adult (under 50) multivitamin supplement.
