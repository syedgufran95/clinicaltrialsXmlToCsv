  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective case-controlled study of the effect of the use of a neuromuscular
      blockade (NMB) monitor on the consumption of NMB agents in patients under mechanical
      ventilation in the context of COVID-19.

      The use of NMB agents during mechanical ventilation in patients with acute respiratory
      distress syndrome (ARDS) improves respiratory support conditions and reduces mortality. In
      the context of COVID-19 pandemic, patients with severe forms of the disease hospitalized in
      intensive care units (ICU) benefit from prolonged mechanical ventilation with frequent use of
      NMB agents. Large amount of such patient admitted in a short time has led to a shortage of
      NMB agents, particularly cisatracurium.

      The use of NMB monitors (for example - Train of Four (TOF)) is a well-established practice in
      general anesthesia. There is no recommendation for the use of NMB monitor in ICU patients
      available up to date. However, in the attempt to reduce the consumption of NMB agents a NMB
      monitoring was used in ICU patients during the COVID-19 pandemic at university hospitals of
      Hospices Civil de Lyon, with the endorsement of the local College of Anesthetists.

      The aim of our study is to evaluate if the use of a NMB monitor decreases the consumption of
      NMB agents in patients under mechanical ventilation in the context of COVID-19.

    <description>We measured the total NMB agents consumption during the stay: cisatracurium and/or atracurium (milligram). Nurses report continuous infusion rates of NMB agents. By extracting this data we were able to retrieve the total approximate dose (we're missing the bolus doses).</description>

    <description>To the introduction of CISATRACURIUM, Initial bolus was at 0.2mg/kg and initial continuous infusion at 0.18mg/kg/h of theoretical ideal weight.
To the introduction of ATRACURIUM, initial bolus was at 0.5mg/kg and initial continuous infusion at 0.5mg/kg/h of theoretical ideal weight.
Introduction of NMBA was associated to deep sedation (RASS - 4 or RAMSAY 6; BIS 40 to 60).
TOF was measured through the electric stimulation of peripheral nerves (facial or ulnar nerve).
The dose of NMB agents was then adapted according to the number of answers to the TOF, per 4 hours:
If 0 response and no respiratory asynchrony: no change in flow rate
If &gt;=1 or respiratory asynchrony: increase of the continuous curare flow by 20% preceded by a bolus identical to the one administered at the beginning of NMB agent, then recheck at H+1.</description>
