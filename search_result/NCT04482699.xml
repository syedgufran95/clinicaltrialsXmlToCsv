      The first-in-human Phase 1 study component will evaluate two dose levels of RAPA-501-ALLO off
      the shelf cells in patients with post-intubation, stage 3 COVID-19 disease, with key
      endpoints of safety, biologic and potential disease-modifying effects. The randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b study component will evaluate infusion of RAPA-501
      ALLO off the shelf cells or a control infusion, with the primary endpoint assessing whether
      RAPA-501 cells reduce 30-day mortality.

      The COVID-19 pandemic is a disaster playing out with progressive morbidity and mortality. As
      of September 18, 2020, an estimated 30.1 million people have contracted the virus and 945,000
      deaths have resulted globally. The United States has the highest totals with an estimated 6.7
      million people diagnosed and 198,000 deaths. In stages 1 and 2 of COVID-19, viral propagation
      within the patient is predominant. As such, therapeutic interventions focus on immune
      molecules (convalescent serum, monoclonal antibodies) and anti-viral medications
      (remdesivir). In marked contrast, the most severe and deadly form of COVID-19, stage 3, is
      driven not by viral propagation, but by an out-of-control immune response (hyperinflammation)
      caused by increases in immune molecules known as cytokines and chemokines. As such,
      therapeutic interventions for stage 3 disease focus on anti-inflammatory medications such as
      anti-cytokine therapy (anti-IL-6 drugs) or corticosteroid therapy. Unfortunately, such
      interventions do not address the full pathogenesis of stage 3 COVID-19, which includes
      hyperinflammation due to &quot;cytokine storm&quot; and &quot;chemokine storm,&quot; tissue damage,
      hypercoagulation, and multi-organ failure (including lung, heart, kidney and brain). The
      pulmonary component of stage 3 disease includes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),
      which is a final-common-pathway of patient death due to a myriad of conditions, including
      pneumonia, sepsis, and trauma. There is a dire need for novel cellular treatments that can
      deliver both a broad-based immune modulation effect and a tissue regenerative effect, such as
      RAPA-501-ALLO off-the-shelf allogeneic hybrid TREG/Th2 Cells.

      Stage 3 COVID-19 carries an estimated 30-day mortality of over 50% in spite of ICU
      utilization, mechanical ventilation, and supportive care therapies to manage ARDS and
      multiorgan failure. Narrowly acting targeted anti-inflammatory approaches such as anti-IL-6
      therapeutics have not been particularly effective in stage 3 COVID-19 and the broad
      anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical approach of corticosteroid therapy, has only modestly
      tempered stage 3 disease in some studies. Cell therapy is also being evaluated in stage 3
      COVID-19, in particular, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and now, with the current
      RAPA-501-ALLO protocol, regulatory T (TREG) cells. TREG therapy has a mechanism of action
      that includes a multi-faceted anti-inflammatory effect, which puts TREG therapy at the
      forefront of future curative therapy of a wide range of autoimmune and neurodegenerative
      diseases, plus transplant complications, such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft
      rejection. In addition, TREG therapy can provide a tissue regenerative effect, which places
      TREG cell therapy at the lead of novel regenerative medicine efforts to repair a myriad of
      tissue-based diseases, such as diseases of the skin, muscle, lung, liver, intestine, heart
      (myocardial infarction) and brain (stroke). RAPA-501-ALLO off-the-shelf cell therapy offers
      this potential dual threat mechanism of action that incorporates both anti-inflammatory and
      tissue repair effects for effective treatment of COVID-19 and multiple lethal conditions.

      RAPA-501-ALLO cells are generated from healthy volunteers, cryopreserved, banked, and are
      then available for off-the-shelf therapy anytime. During manufacturing, T cells are
      &quot;reprogrammed&quot; ex vivo using a novel, patented 7-day two-step process that involves T cell
      de-differentiation and subsequent re-differentiation towards the two key anti-inflammatory
      programs, the TREG and Th2 pathways, thus creating a &quot;hybrid&quot; product. The hybrid phenotype
      inhibits inflammatory pathways operational in COVID-19, including modulation of multiple
      cytokines and chemokines, which attract inflammatory cells into tissue for initiation of
      multi-organ damage. The hybrid TREG and Th2 phenotype of RAPA-501-ALLO cells cross-regulates
      Th1 and Th17 populations that initiate hyperinflammation of COVID-19. RAPA-501 immune
      modulation occurs in a T cell receptor independent manner, thus permitting off-the-shelf cell
      therapy. Finally, in experimental models of viral pneumonia and ARDS, TREG cells mediate a
      protective effect on the lung alveolar tissue. Because of this unique mechanism of action
      that involves both anti-inflammatory and tissue protective effects, the allogeneic RAPA-501 T
      cell product is particularly suited for evaluation in the setting of post-intubation, Stage 3
      COVID-19.

      RAPA-501-ALLO off-the-shelf allogeneic hybrid TREG/Th2 Cells.

      The mechanism of fatal pneumonia in experimental murine coronavirus infection is mediated by
      innate inflammasome activation, a resultant robust infiltration of inflammatory monocytes and
      macrophages, and a subsequent increase in multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
      Importantly, the CD4+ and CD8+ adaptive T cell response to experimental coronavirus infection
      can be either curative or disease propagating. Viral-induced pulmonary inflammation has also
      been evaluated in non-human primate models, which have confirmed that dysregulated immune
      activation during viral pneumonia involves T cell subset imbalance, a downstream
      monocyte-derived inflammatory cascade, and resultant epithelial cell injury. In humans,
      severity of viral-induced lower respiratory tract infection correlates with increased numbers
      of effector memory CD8+ T cells in the airway. As recently reviewed, human coronavirus
      infection represents an ongoing battle between virus and host, with the nature of the
      response dictating disease cure or alternatively, aggravated lung disease. Evidence exists
      that the adaptive immune system contributes to pulmonary inflammation during SARS-associated
      Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) disease: that is, bronchoalveolar fluid from such subjects had
      increased T cell numbers and increased Th1-associated molecules IL-12, IFN-gamma, and IP-10.
      This downstream adaptive T cell-mediated inflammatory response is driven in part by the
      SARS-Co-V protein viroporin 3a. Specifically, viroporin molecules activate the NLRP3
      inflammasome that links innate-to-adaptive inflammatory responses. Furthermore, both SARS-CoV
      and SARS-CoV-2 express an open-reading-frame ORF3a molecule, which also activate the NLRP3
      inflammasome.

      The nature of immunity during resolution of symptomatic COVID-19 infection has recently been
      reported, namely: emergence of antibody-secreting cells and CD4+ T follicular helper cells;
      increase in perforin- and granzyme-expressing CD8+ T cells; and relative lack of an increase
      in pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In marked contrast, patients with severe
      COVID-19 disease had greatly increased plasma levels of cytokines (including IL-2 and
      TNF-alpha) and chemokines (including IP-10 and MIP-1-alpha) (Huang et al., Lancet, 2020).
      Collectively, these results indicate that pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses
      that occur in severe COVID-19 is detrimental and that effective anti-inflammatory approaches
      may ultimately prove to be therapeutic. However, as previously detailed, the more advanced
      Stage 3 COVID-19 disease is characterized by an ARDS component, and cytokine storm, as such,
      novel approaches to treat the COVID-19 viral pneumonia should optimally incorporate both an
      anti-inflammatory element and a tissue protection/tissue repair element.

      Stage 3 COVID-19 carries an estimated 30-day mortality of over 50% in spite of ICU
      utilization, mechanical ventilation, and supportive care therapies to manage ARDS and
      multiorgan failure. Narrowly acting targeted anti-inflammatory approaches such as anti-IL-6
      therapeutics have not been particularly effective in stage 3 COVID-19 and the broad
      anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical approach of corticosteroid therapy, has only modestly
      tempered stage 3 disease in some studies. Cell therapy is also being evaluated in stage 3
      COVID-19, in particular, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and now, with the current
      RAPA-501-ALLO protocol, regulatory T (TREG) cells. TREG therapy has a mechanism of action
      that includes a multi-faceted anti-inflammatory effect, which puts TREG therapy at the
      forefront of future curative therapy of a wide range of autoimmune and neurodegenerative
      diseases, plus transplant complications, such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft
      rejection. In addition, TREG therapy can provide a tissue regenerative effect, which places
      TREG cell therapy at the lead of novel regenerative medicine efforts to repair a myriad of
      tissue-based diseases, such as diseases of the skin, muscle, lung, liver, intestine, heart
      (myocardial infarction) and brain (stroke). RAPA-501-ALLO off-the-shelf cell therapy offers
      this potential dual threat mechanism of action that incorporates both anti-inflammatory and
      tissue repair effects for effective treatment of COVID-19 and multiple lethal conditions.

      RAPA-501-ALLO cells are generated from healthy volunteers, cryopreserved, banked, and are
      then available for off-the-shelf therapy anytime. During manufacturing, T cells are
      &quot;reprogrammed&quot; ex vivo using a novel, patented 7-day two-step process that involves T cell
      de-differentiation and subsequent re-differentiation towards the two key anti-inflammatory
      programs, the TREG and Th2 pathways, thus creating a &quot;hybrid&quot; product. The hybrid phenotype
      inhibits inflammatory pathways operational in COVID-19, including modulation of multiple
      cytokines and chemokines, which attract inflammatory cells into tissue for initiation of
      multi-organ damage. The hybrid TREG and Th2 phenotype of RAPA-501-ALLO cells cross-regulates
      Th1 and Th17 populations that initiate hyperinflammation of COVID-19. RAPA-501 immune
      modulation occurs in a T cell receptor independent manner, thus permitting off-the-shelf cell
      therapy. Finally, in experimental models of viral pneumonia and ARDS, TREG cells mediate a
      protective effect on the lung alveolar tissue. Because of this unique mechanism of action
      that involves both anti-inflammatory and tissue protective effects, the allogeneic RAPA-501 T
      cell product is particularly suited for evaluation in the setting of post-intubation, Stage 3
      COVID-19.

      In general, classical autoimmune disease, neurodegenerative disease, and viral-induced
      inflammatory disease are driven by predominance of Th1/Th17-type responses with a relative
      insufficiency of the counter-regulatory immune suppressive Th2 and TREG subsets. TREG cells,
      which are defined in part by their expression of FOXP3 transcription factor, have been
      extensively studied in experimental models for their capacity to modulate autoimmune disease,
      neurodegenerative disease, and transplantation complications, including graft-versus-host
      disease (GVHD) and graft rejection. Importantly, T cell production of IL-2 or exogenous IL-2
      administration drives lung inflammation during experimental viral infection; therefore, given
      the known role of TREG cells as a consumer of IL-2, there is a strong mechanistic rationale
      for a beneficial contribution of TREG cells during viral-driven lung inflammation.
      Furthermore, in an experimental murine models of virus-induced lung inflammation and lung
      injury, interventions that augmented TREG cell number and function accelerated the repair of
      lung injury. And, Th2 cells, which are defined in part by their expression of GATA3
      transcription factor, were described thirty years ago as a powerful counter-regulatory
      population to prevent Th1 cell predominance. It is important to note that clinical data
      indicates that maneuvers that increase immune suppressive cell populations, including TREG
      cells, can reduce severe inflammatory disease such as graft-versus-host disease without
      impairing anti-viral immunity. In addition, in both experimental models and clinical studies,
      an appropriate level of TREG cells can result in an overall improvement in pulmonary
      inflammation during viral bronchiolitis. Collectively, these findings indicate that T cells
      expressing a combined TREG/Th2 phenotype would predictably yield beneficial effects in the
      setting of viral-induced pulmonary inflammation and injury associated with severe Stage 3
      COVID-19 disease.

      Clinical trials have evaluated both TREG and Th2-type cells for various conditions, most
      prominently transplantation complications. In general, thymic-derived natural (n)TREG cells
      are thought to express a more stable phenotype than post-thymic induced (i)TREG cells; by
      comparison, iTREG cells can mediate more potent suppression. Nonetheless, both nTREG and
      iTREG cells are susceptible to differentiation plasticity, which creates concern that a
      potentially therapeutic TREG population might convert to pathogenic Th1/Th17 phenotypes in
      vivo. Ex vivo expanded (n)TREG cells were evaluated in the setting of allogeneic
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using cord blood donors; more recently, the same
      research group has developed ex vivo expanded (i)TREG cell therapy to limit transplant
      complications. In addition, ex vivo expanded nTREG cells have been evaluated in the setting
      of type I diabetes mellitus; this clinical trial found that TREG therapy was safe and at
      least transiently effective in improving disease control. Furthermore, in the setting of
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is a disease propagated by a severe Th1-driven
      peripheral and central inflammatory response, a clinical trial of nTREG cell adoptive
      transfer identified that the intervention was safe and showed promise in terms of ALS disease
      amelioration. Finally, in a phase II study of rapamycin-resistant Th2 cell therapy in the
      setting of low-intensity allogeneic HCT, adoptive Th2 cell transfer was safe and associated
      with a shift towards Th2 polarization in vivo, preservation of donor engraftment,
      stabilization of mixed chimerism, a low rate of GVHD, and potent anti-tumor effects in
      patients with refractory hematologic malignancy. Collectively, these clinical trial results
      indicate that the adoptive transfer of TREG and Th2-type populations can be safely
      administered, even in the allogeneic HCT setting, and can mediate beneficial modulation of
      inflammatory conditions.

      Ex vivo manufacturing can be utilized to generate induced (i)TREG cells from the post-thymic
      pool of peripheral T cells. In the current protocol, the manufacturing method will focus upon
      mTOR inhibition, which is an established intervention that promotes the induction of TREG
      cells. In combination with mTOR inhibition, the culture system that is utilized incorporates
      cytokines that promote both a Th2 and a TREG phenotype, namely, IL-4, TGF-beta, and IL-2.
      Finally, the protocol will include a TREG/Th2 cell product comprised of both CD4+ and CD8+ T
      cell subsets, as these counter-regulatory T cell subsets express differential T cell receptor
      (TCR) repertoires and a diversity of effector mechanisms that can potentially enhance an
      anti-inflammatory effect. For RAPA-501 manufacture, peripheral blood mononuclear cells are
      collected from a steady-state apheresis and subjected to the following two-step culture
      intervention: in step 1, a severe starvation step results in T cell de-differentiation, which
      is realized through both selective media utilization and the addition of FDA-approved
      pharmaceutical agents that potently inhibit mTOR signaling; and in step 2, re-differentiation
      of T cells occurs using co-stimulation agents and Th2- and TREG-type polarizing cytokines.
      After 6-days in culture, the resultant TREG/Th2 population is cryopreserved in single-use
      aliquots at protocol-driven therapeutic doses. T cells of type II cytokine phenotype are
      characterized in part by their expression of the transcription factor GATA3 whereas
      regulatory T cell populations are identified in part by their expression of FOXP3
      transcription factor. At culture initiation, a very low frequency of T cells express either
      GATA3 or FOXP3. In contrast, the RAPA-501 cell product manufactured in the TREG/Th2 culture
      conditions expresses a high frequency of T cells that are either single-positive for GATA3,
      single-positive for FOXP3, or double-positive for both GATA3 and FOXP3. Importantly, this
      transcription factor profile is expressed in both manufactured CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. It is
      important to note that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations with TREG function have been
      defined, including a CD8+ TREG population that potently suppresses GVHD; it is potentially
      advantageous to have both subsets represented in a therapeutic product because CD4+ and CD8+
      TREG cells utilize differential effector mechanisms.

      Regulatory T cell populations can suppress pathogenic effector T cell populations by several
      defined mechanisms, including through expression of CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidase molecules,
      which act to hydrolyse pro-inflammatory ATP towards the immune suppressive adenosine
      substrate . Indeed, TREG cells that express CD39 possess increased suppressive function and
      have been associated with resolution of inflammatory bowel disease. Furthermore, suppressive
      function of human TREG cells is mediated in part by CD73. T cells manufactured in the
      TREG/Th2 culture condition have an increase in expression of the TREG-associated effector
      molecules, CD39 and CD73. In addition to the CD39/CD73 ectonucleotidases, TREG cell function
      has also been correlated with expression of CD103, which is an integrin that dictates
      epithelial lymphocyte localization. Indeed, CD103 and IL-2 receptor signaling cooperate to
      maintain immune tolerance in the gut mucosa; furthermore, CD103-expressing TREG cells are
      critical for amelioration of experimental chronic GVHD . T cells manufactured in the TREG/Th2
      culture condition have increased expression of the TREG effector molecule CD103.

      In experimental models, the efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy is dependent upon successful
      engraftment and in vivo T cell persistence. Importantly, the T cell differentiation state
      helps dictate in vivo persistence, with less differentiated cells having increased
      persistence. Murine rapamycin-resistant T cells, which expressed a T central memory (TCM)
      phenotype, had increased in vivo engraftment potential relative to control T cells. In
      addition, human rapamycin-resistant T cells also had increased engraftment in a
      human-into-murine model of xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease. T cells with reduced
      differentiation relative to the T effector memory (TEM) population have increased in vivo
      persistence and mediate increased in vivo effects, including the TCM subset, the naïve T cell
      subset, and more recently, the T stem cell memory (TSCM) subset. This relationship between T
      cell differentiation status and in vivo T cell function is relevant to TREG cells, as: (1)
      TREG cells of TCM phenotype were more effective at reducing experimental GVHD relative to
      TREG cells of TEM phenotype; and (2) TREG cells that expressed the stem cell marker CD150
      were highly effective for the prevention of stem cell graft rejection. T cells manufactured
      in the TREG/Th2 culture condition are enriched for cells having a reduced differentiation
      state consistent with a T stem cell subset, including expression of the CD150 marker.

      It is also important to assess the cytokine secretion profile of the manufactured RAPA-501
      cells. First, it is critical that the cell product is capable of IL-4 secretion, which is the
      driver cytokine for subsequent Th2 differentiation. Second, it is desirable that an
      adoptively transferred T cell population is capable of secreting IL-2, as this capacity
      indicates a progenitor function that permits T cells to expand more readily in vivo without
      the need for exogenous IL-2 . Finally, it is important that the RAPA-501 cell population has
      reduced secretion of the Th1- or Th17-type cytokines IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-17, and GM-CSF.
      The manufactured RAPA-501 cell product secretes IL-4 and IL-2 with minimal secretion of Th1-
      or Th17-type cytokines.

      Regulatory T cells can also be defined in part by their ability to suppress the proliferation
      or function of effector T cells. Importantly, manufactured TREG/Th2 cells potently suppress
      Th1/Tc1 cell secretion of multiple inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, and
      TNF-alpha. To assess the mechanism of suppression, experiments were performed using the
      transwell assay, whereby effector T cells and RAPA-501 cells are separated by a filter that
      prevents cell-to-cell contact but allows cell communication by small soluble mediators such
      as cytokines. RAPA-501 cells acted in a TCR-independent manner to suppress the cytokine
      secretion capacity of effector T cells. Because no co-stimulation was provided to the
      transwell chamber containing RAPA-501 cells, RAPA-501 cells did not require co-stimulation to
      modulate inflammatory cytokine levels, including IL-2, IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, and TNF-alpha. The
      following cytokines and chemokines were reduced by RAPA-501 cells in this transwell assay,
      with relatively equal suppression mediated by CD4+ and CD8+ subsets of RAPA-501 cells: CCL1,
      CCL2, CCL7, CCL11, CCL13, CCL17, CCL20, CCL22, CCL26, CXCL1, CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL12, IL-6,
      IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, and IL-10. The ability of TREG cells to consume IL-2 is a commonly
      described phenomenon, although previous studies identified the requirement of cell-to-cell
      contact for IL-2 consumption. As such, RAPA-501 cells are uniquely capable of modulating the
      level of multiple inflammatory cytokines in a contact-independent manner. These results
      suggest that RAPA-501 cells represent a suitable candidate for neutralization of multiple
      cytokines and chemokines associated with various diseases, including viral-induced lung
      inflammation. In light of this capacity of the RAPA-501 cell product to suppress T
      cell-mediated inflammation in a TCR-independent manner, RAPA-501 therapy is highly suitable
      for allogeneic, off-the-shelf treatment applications.

      Further experiments were performed to evaluate whether the RAPA-501 cell product might also
      regulate human CNS microglial cells, which are myeloid-derived cells that are analogous to
      the peripheral monocyte population. To evaluate whether the RAPA-501 cell product might
      modulate pro-inflammatory microglial cells in a contact-independent manner, the ability of
      RAPA-501 cells to reduce the inflammatory state of the microglial cell line HMC3 was tested
      in a transwell assay. RAPA-501 cells reduced the HMC3 cell secretion of the pro-inflammatory
      cytokines IL-6 and IFN-gamma and the pro-inflammatory chemokine IP-10 at the relatively low
      ratio of RAPA-501 cells to microglial cells of 1:40. These results demonstrate that the
      RAPA-501 product is capable of inhibiting cytokine and chemokine secretion from
      myeloid-derived populations in a contact- and TCR-independent manner, thereby providing a
      further rationale for allogeneic, off-the-shelf utilization of the RAPA-501 product.

      RAPA-501 cell product for stability of T cell phenotype was also evaluated. That is, it has
      been determined that a limiting factor of TREG cell therapy may be differentiation
      plasticity, for example, whereby TREG cells can be influenced by inflammatory cytokines to
      lose their TREG characteristics and adopt a Th1-type inflammatory state, which may then
      promote disease pathogenesis. To address this possibility, the RAPA-501 cell capacity to
      modulate T cell differentiation transcription factors after an extended culture interval that
      involved T cell co-stimulation, the absence of mTOR inhibitors, and the presence of the
      polarizing inflammatory cytokines IFN-alpha and IL-6 was studied. These experiments
      demonstrated that the RAPA-501 cell product had remarkable differentiation stability
      (continued expression of FOXP3 and GATA3 in CD4+ and CD8+ subsets; lack of up-regulation of
      TBET).

      In summary, RAPA-501 cells express a phenotype consistent with a regulatory T cell
      population, including: stable expression of the TREG and Th2 transcription factors FOXP3 and
      GATA3; expression of the TREG functional molecules CD39, CD73, and CD103; expression of a
      reduced state of T cell differentiation, including expression of the stem cell marker CD150;
      secretion of a Th2 pattern of cytokines with minimal secretion of Th1/Th17-type cytokines;
      functional suppressive capacity against both effector Th1/Tc1 cells and pro-inflammatory
      myeloid cells, including reduced levels of multiple inflammatory cytokines and chemokines;
      and a capacity to inhibit inflammatory effectors in a contact- and TCR-independent manner.
      Collectively, these characteristics of the RAPA-501 product predicts that this therapy
      represents a novel and promising candidate to treat severe COVID-19 disease.

      This is a first-in-human phase 1/phase 2b study evaluating allogeneic RAPA-501 cell therapy
      in participants with severe, post-intubation Stage 3 COVID-19 disease. Two phase 1 cohorts
      will be evaluated, namely, a low-dose Cohort 1 (40 x 10^6 cells/infusion) and a high-dose
      Cohort 2 (160 x 10^6 cells/infusion); this phase 1 component will utilize
      dose-limiting-toxicity (DLT) as a primary endpoint. Provided that safety is demonstrated in
      the phase 1 study component, each RAPA-501 dose cohort can be evaluated in the randomized
      phase 2b component. In the phase 2b component, for each RAPA-501 dose level determined to be
      safe, patients will be randomized to receive RAPA-501 cells (n=19) or placebo (n=19). After
      infusion of either RAPA-501 cells or placebo, these randomized cohorts will continue on
      standard-of-care therapy (not protocol-driven). The primary endpoint of the phase 2b study is
      30-day mortality, with the statistical goal of reducing mortality in RAPA-501 recipients
      relative to the randomized, placebo-control cohort.

      Study participants must be hospitalized patients with severe, post-intubation Stage 3
      COVID-19 disease, specifically: SARS-CoV-2 infection, as determined by RT-PCR or equivalent
      test; pulmonary infiltrate on radiologic examination; and respiratory insufficiency that
      required intubation and mechanical ventilation initiated within 4 days prior to RAPA-501
      therapy. The study consists of: (1) a study enrollment step (screening); and (2) after
      eligibility is confirmed, infusion of RAPA-501 cells will be performed. On Cohort 1, infusion
      of RAPA-501 cells will be at a dose of 40 x 10^6 cells/infusion; three participants will be
      initially treated, with one week separating participants in this phase 1 component to
      evaluate for DLT, which will be defined as grade 3 or greater toxicity attributable to
      RAPA-501 cells within 7-days of infusion. At any point that Cohort 1 therapy is deemed to be
      safe (either 0/3 or 1/6 having a DLT), then Cohort 1 RAPA-501 therapy can be evaluated in the
      randomized phase 2b study component to address the primary study objective relating to 30-day
      mortality. At any point that Cohort 1 therapy is deemed to be safe, treatment on Cohort 2 can
      be initiated, which will evaluate the infusion of RAPA-501 cells at a dose of 160 x 10^6
      cells/infusion. In the same manner as Cohort 1, if Cohort 2 therapy is deemed to be safe,
      Cohort 2 RAPA-501 therapy can be evaluated in the randomized phase 2b study component to
      address the primary study objective relating to 30-day mortality. The study will be comprised
      of three main stages: (1) the above-detailed 30-day interval relating to the primary study
      objectives; (2) an extended, total 90-day interval to continue relatively intensive clinical
      monitoring of potential efficacy and safety endpoints; and (3) an extended, total 6-month
      interval to provide long-term clinical follow-up and to continue to monitor for laboratory
      parameters relating to immune and viral endpoints.
