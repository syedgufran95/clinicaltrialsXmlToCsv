  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, multi-centre, open-label randomised controlled study to assess the early
      efficacy of intravenous (IV) administration of CYP-001 in adults admitted to an intensive
      care unit (ICU) with COVID-19.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After enrolment upon meeting eligibility criteria (D0), participants baseline data will be
      collected and participants will be randomised to receive either standard of care treatment
      only, or standard of care plus CYP-001. On D1 and D3, each participant randomised to receive
      CYP-001 will receive an IV infusion of 2 million Cymerus mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)/kg of
      body weight (up to a maximum of 200 million cells). Participants will have further data
      collection throughout their ICU and hospital stay and follow up to 28 days.

    <description>The investigational medicinal product used in this study is known as CYP-001. The active agent in CYP-001 is Cymerusâ„¢ MSCs. CYP-001 is supplied as 100 million Cymerus MSCs formulated in 20 mL cryoprotectant medium. On D1 and D3, each participant randomised to receive CYP-001 will receive an IV infusion of 2 million Cymerus MSCs/kg of body weight (up to a maximum of 200 million cells per infusion).</description>
