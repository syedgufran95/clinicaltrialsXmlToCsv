      COVID-19 is increasingly affecting children but convalescent plasma (CP) has not been
      adequately studied in children to date. The study will determine safety of convalescent
      plasma for pediatric patients with severe, or at high risk for severe, COVID-19 disease.

      COVID19 is an emerging infection with no current approved treatment or prevention. COVID-19
      is increasingly affecting children but convalescent plasma (CP) has not been adequately
      studied in children to date. The study will determine safety of convalescent plasma for
      pediatric patients with severe, or at high risk for severe, COVID-19 disease.

    <description>Once the patient meets criteria for CP infusion (severity of disease and risk factor determination and absence of exclusion criteria), an ABO compatible product will be identified. The CP dose administered will be 10mL/kg/dose (up to 2 units per dose) times two doses per patient for a total dose of 20 mL/kg. Patients will be followed for adverse events and clinical response. Research blood testing will be obtained prior to infusion (baseline) and serially weekly afterwards until clinical resolution. Patients will receive 2 doses equaling 20 mL/kg (if available) of ABO compatible CP over 24-48 hours if they do not experience grade 3-5 adverse events that are possible, probably, or definitely attributed to CP after the first dose. Patients will be followed for adverse events for a minimum of 28 days after the last infusion of CP.</description>
