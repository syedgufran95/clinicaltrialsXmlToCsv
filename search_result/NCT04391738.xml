  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will involve collection of pseudonymized data from hospital-based data reporting
      at multiple international sites. Collating data from a large volume of patients with COVID-19
      admitted in ICU across multiple international sites will enable investigation of whether
      obesity is a risk factor for complicated from of SARS-CoV-2 in adult patients and whether
      this association is independent of other cardiometabolic risk factors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic is characterized by a high frequency of patients with severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), who often require invasive mechanical
      ventilation (IMV). Body mass index (BMI) was however rarely mentioned in early clinical
      reports.

      Disease severity gradually increased with body mass index (BMI) categories among patients
      admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2
      (SARS-CoV-2), the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), reaching 85% in patients
      with class II or III obesity ( BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2).

      In summary, there is an urgent need for more evidence on the specific role played by obesity
      in the development of COVID-19 complications, and more particularly of severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)
