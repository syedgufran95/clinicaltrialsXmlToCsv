    <textblock>
      Primary objective of this study is to identify the compliance of Greek people in mask-wearing
      directive and explore potential associations with refractive errors, spectacles and contact
      lenses use.

      Present study aims to identify whether Greek people have complied with mask-wearing directive
      and to investigate the correlation of outcomes with visual acuity - refractive errors,
      spectacles and contact lenses use. For the purposes of this research, a questionnaire of 20
      items including the following sub scales have been developed: a) near vision, b) distance
      vision, c) ocular discomfort, d) driving, e) limitations, need for help, work collaboration,
      and emotional impact

    <description>Participants are contacted through social networks (Facebook) which provide a link to website that contains the questionnaire. Then, they complete the questionnaire which consists of the following 2 parts:
participant's demographic characteristics with questions regarding age, visual acuity - refractive error, spectacles and contact lenses use, and compliance to mask-wearing directives.
20 items that construct 5 subscales: a) near vision (5 items), b) distance vision (3 items), c) ocular discomfort (3 items), d) driving (2 items), e) limitations (3 items), need for help (2 items), work collaboration (1 item), and emotional impact (1 item).
The impact of spectacles on the compliance of Greek people to mask-wearing directives will be assessed via this questionnaire.</description>
