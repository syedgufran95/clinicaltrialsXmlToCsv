      Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of Danoprevir sodium tablet combined with ritonavir for
      SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given no specific antiviral therapies for COVID-19 approved yet and Danoprevir sodium tablet,
      an oral Hepatitis C virus protease inhibitor, approved in China in June 2018 , this open,
      controlled trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Danoprevir sodium tablet in
      hospitalized patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Aged 18-75 years old;

          2. Pneumonia patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were confirmed to be positive by RT-PCR
             and clinical manifestations. The diagnosis standard refers to the diagnosis and
             treatment plan for pneumonia with SARS-CoV-2 infection (Current Trial Version);

          3. Patients with newly diagnosed respiratory system discomfort who have been hospitalized
             (the diagnosis time of respiratory system discomfort shall not exceed 7 days);

          4. Women and their partners who have no planned pregnancy for nearly half a year and are
             willing to take effective contraceptive measures within 30 days from the first
             administration of the study drug to the last administration;

          5. Agree not to participate in other clinical research within 30 days from the first
             administration of the study drug to the last administration;

          6. Patients who voluntarily sign informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The pneumonia patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection met one of the following
             conditions: respiratory distress, RR≥30 times / min; or SaO2 / SpO2≤93% in resting
             state; or arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / concentration of oxygen (FiO2)
             ≤300MMHG (1mmhg = 0.133kpa);

          2. Pneumonia patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection meet one of the following
             conditions: respiratory failure and need mechanical ventilation; or shock; or other
             organ failure combined with ICU monitoring treatment;

          3. Severe liver disease (such as child Pugh score ≥C, AST &gt; 5 times upper limit);

          4. Patients with contraindications specified in the instructions of danoprevir and
             ritonavir tablets;

          5. Patients who plan to take protease inhibitors other than danoprevir and ritonavir
             simultaneously during the trial.

          6. The pregnancy test of female subjects in the screening period was positive;

          7. The researchers judged that it was not suitable to participate in this clinical trial
             (for example, patients who may be transferred to another hospital during the study
             period; patients with multiple basic diseases, etc.).
