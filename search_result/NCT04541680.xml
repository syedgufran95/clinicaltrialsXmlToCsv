  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no approved treatment for COVID-19 in France, either for the acute phase,
      nor for the late chronic phase. the investigator suggest that nintedanib has the potential to
      block the development of lung fibrosis when initiated early enough to inhibit the activation
      of mesenchymal cells and the progression of virus-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Computerized
      Tomography (CT) manifestations of fibrosis or fibrous stripes are described in COVID-19 (Ye,
      Eur Radiol 2020). Pan et al observed fibrous stripes in 17% patients in the early phase of
      the disease (Pan, Eur Radiol 2020). Ye et al observed bronchiectasis in 2 patients (15.4%)
      and evidence of pulmonary fibrosis in 3 patients (23.7%) at HRCT performed at 4 weeks (Ye,
      Eur Radiol 2020). Long term data are still lacking in patients with COVID-19 and the
      investigators do not know how many patients will have fibrotic sequelae from the acute
      illness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, investigators have a very limited view on the long-term pulmonary sequelae after
      COVID-19 pneumonia, particularly in the most severe forms requiring hospitalization. Early
      thoracic HRCT is a useful tool for the evaluation of patients suspected of COVID-19
      pneumonia. Typical features are evocative of the disease in an epidemic context, with
      multifocal ground-glass opacities, being nodular or not, or crazy-paving with or without
      consolidations, with a bilateral, peripheral or mixed distribution and involvement of the
      posterior zones. CT manifestations of fibrosis or fibrous stripes are described in COVID-19.
      Pan et al observed fibrous stripes in 17% patients in the early phase of the disease. Ye et
      al observed bronchiectasis in 2 patients (15.4%) and evidence of pulmonary fibrosis in 3
      patients (23.7%) at HRCT performed at 4 weeks. Long term data are still lacking in patients
      with COVID-19 and the investigators do not know how many patients will have fibrotic sequelae
      from the acute illness.
