  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective nationwide cohort study of pregnant women enrolled early in gestation and
      followed for Covid-19 exposure and infection, with follow up of obstetrical outcomes and
      infant development through the first year of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ASPIRE is focused on the first trimester, a critical and vulnerable period when all of a
      baby's organ systems form and the placenta - the crucial connection between mom and baby -
      develops.

      Currently, there are no data about the effects of COVID-19 infections in the first trimester.
      The study will provide critical information to:

        1. Guide the care of pregnant women

        2. Protect the safety of their babies and families

        3. Help those considering pregnancy in the future understand what it means to be pregnant
           in this new era

      The investigators are recruiting 10,000 women from the start of pregnancy and will track
      COVID-19 exposures using frequent serology testing. The investigators will collect
      information during and after the pregnancy to try to determine the effects of COVID 19 for
      mom and baby.

      Participants will be asked to do the following throughout pregnancy:

        -  Submit frequent, quick (&lt;1 minute each) symptom tracking reports using your mobile phone
           and/or computer.

        -  Collect finger-stick blood samples from home at several points throughout your
           pregnancy.

        -  Give permission to review medical records related to your pregnancy, delivery and baby's
           development.

        -  Complete questionnaires online about your health during your pregnancy and after
           delivery of your baby.

    <measure>Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection throughout pregnancy in women</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection throughout pregnancy in women whose pregnancy was documented at a SART member clinic in the United States between November 2019-December 2020. The investigators will use patient-reported information on infection symptoms as well as serological testing to capture both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. Deliverable: By instituting the first prospectively tracked U.S.-based pregnancy cohort with precisely timed conception, the investigators will provide foundational, urgent data regarding the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection at varying gestational ages, across the real-time evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and in the setting of various public health measures to reduce infection spread.</description>

    <description>Determine risk ratios of adverse obstetric outcomes in women infected with SARS-CoV-2 during early pregnancy onward compared to non-infected pregnant women. The investigators will focus on timing of infection (gestational month) and extent of COVID-19 symptoms as potential predictors of risk. Deliverable: The investigators will provide critical information about the maternal and fetal implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection at specific time points in pregnancy, compared to non-exposed pregnancies, and enable evidence-based obstetric surveillance protocols.</description>

      At-home blood spot kits will be used for serology surveillance. Tests will occur weekly
      during the first trimester and monthly during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.
      Covid-19 antibody serology and cytokine testing will be assayed using these blood spot cars.
