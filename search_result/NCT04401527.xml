      This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial will evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of intravenous Sodium Nitrite Injection for treatment of patients
      infected with COVID-19 who develop lung injury and require mechanical ventilation.

      This Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial will
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous Sodium Nitrite Injection for treatment of
      patients infected with COVID-19 who develop lung injury and require mechanical ventilation.
      The primary objective is to compare the two treatment groups with respect to the proportion
      of study subjects who are alive and free of respiratory failure at Day 28.

             with nitrite metabolism);

          7. Treatment within the past 24 hours with organic nitrates such as nitroglycerin,
             isosorbide mononitrate, isosorbide dinitrate, sodium nitroprusside, and inhaled nitric

             500 cells/µL), and/or active hepatitis B or C, cirrhosis, or uncontrolled psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements;

         14. Treatment within 30 days or 5 half-lives of that agent (whichever is shorter) before
             the first study drug dose using another investigational drug. Notwithstanding,
             prospective subjects who receive any of the following drugs or treatments before the
             first study drug dose or during this study may be considered for participation in this
             study: (1) a commercially available, FDA-approved drug or treatment used off-label for
             the treatment of COVID-19, or (2) a drug or treatment that has FDA Emergency Use
             Authorization for the treatment of COVID-19 patients;
