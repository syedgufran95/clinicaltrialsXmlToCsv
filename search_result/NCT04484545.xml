  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As of 27th May 2020, approximately 5.7 million people worldwide are known to have been
      infected with COVID-19 coronavirus and more than 350,000 have died (1). The severity of this
      viral disease for an individual is associated with a widespread perturbation of immune,
      physiological and metabolic parameters (2, 3). These whole body changes could be considered
      characteristic of a systemic inflammatory response to tissue injury and it has been long
      recognised that a large and ongoing systemic inflammatory response is associated with the
      development of multiple organ failure and infective disease (4, 5).

      One of the cardinal signs of severe COVID-19 infection is a marked systemic inflammatory
      response (2). This response bears striking similarity to the systemic inflammatory response
      experienced by patients undergoing major elective surgical resections for cancer (6, 7).
      Indeed, the systemic inflammatory response and the associated metabolic stress has been most
      well characterised in major elective surgery, where the relationship between the magnitude of
      the post-operative systemic inflammatory response and the development of post-operative
      complications is now well recognised, as is the effect of patient comorbidity on this
      relationship (8, 9). Such work has informed therapeutic manoeuvres including minimally
      invasive surgery, pre-operative optimisation (e.g. anaesthesia, nutrition and steroids) and
      enhanced recovery protocols.

      The aim of the present study was to examine whether routinely collected clinicopathological
      characteristics of patients with COVID-19 on admission were informative on the immune and
      metabolic stress experienced by patients with COVID-19 and whether such characteristics were
      informative on subsequent outcome.

      Electronic patient records for patients who attended the Emergency Department (ED) and Acute
      Assessment Unit (AAU) at Glasgow Royal Infirmary (GRI), Glasgow, U.K., during the initial
      7-week period of the COVID-19 pandemic in Glasgow city (17th March 2020 - 1st May 2020) were
      examined for routine clinical, laboratory and clinical outcome data. GRI is a university
      teaching hospital that serves an urban population with a high burden of socio-economic
      deprivation and offers the full spectrum of adult acute receiving specialties to patients
      over 16 years old. In line with NHS policy, this study was approved by the NHS Greater
      Glasgow and Clyde Caldicott guardian.
