  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the ER of National Taiwan University Hospital, the critical patients are treated
      (including tracheal intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation) in either resuscitation
      area or negative pressure isolation rooms based on the past history and present illness.
      During COVID-19 epidemic, whether sequential changes in environmental and personal protective
      equipment would change the difference of treatment efficacy and patient safety remains
      unclear. Whether treating patients in resuscitation area or negative pressure isolation room
      would cause different physical and psychological stress of medical staff and environmental
      contamination is also unknown. This study aims to conduct a prospective sequential allocation
      clinical trial to investigate the success rate, patient safety, physical and psychological
      stress of medical staff, and the risk of environmental contamination of tracheal intubation
      and cardiopulmonary resuscitation between the resuscitation area and negative pressure
      isolation room. The results of the study may be used to improve the protocol and protective
      policy in treating critical patients during an epidemic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The critical care of patients with an emergency has always been the clinical challenge to the
      medical staff in the emergency room (ER). The emergency includes sudden cardiac arrest,
      respiratory failure, acute conscious change, cardiovascular emergency, sepsis, etc. How to
      treat these patients appropriately and immediately is an important issue, which may change
      the disease process and prognosis, and save the life.

      Owing to the epidemic of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), several changes in the
      environmental and personal protective equipment have been made in the ER when treating
      critical patients. The doctor and nurses need to wear individual protective equipment
      including Level C protective clothing, goggles, N95 mask, surgical mask, guard panel, hair
      cap, and double-layered gloves to prevent infectious droplet during tracheal intubation.
      However, the protective equipment may limit the movement and obstruct the vision and thus
      result in response delays, difficult intubation, and prolong hand-off period during
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation. On the other hand, wearing N95 mask, surgical mask and guard
      panel may impair the communication. Additionally, the medical staff may not have enough time
      to wear the protective equipment during emergency events, and therefore suffer from a higher
      risk of infection, which may consequently cause a certain level of psychological stress.

      This study aims to conduct a prospective sequential allocation clinical trial to investigate
      the success rate, patient safety, physical and psychological stress of medical staff, and the
      risk of environmental contamination of tracheal intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation
      between the resuscitation area and negative pressure isolation room. The results of the study
      may be used to improve the protocol and protective policy in treating critical patients
      during an epidemic.
