      Ivermectin plus losartan as prophilaxy to severe events in patients with cancer with recent
      diagnosis of COVID-19

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, doubled-blind and placebo-controlled phase II study that will evaluate
      the efficacy of the early use of ivermectin plus losartan in cancer patients who present with
      recent diagnosis of COVID-19.

      The trial will enroll 176 patients with previous diagnosis of active cancer (88 in each arm)
      and the aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of these drugs combination to decrease the
      incidence of COVID-19 severe complications. Patients will receive single dose ivermectin of
      12mg after the confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, followed by 15 days of losartan.

      We believe that the association of anti-viral activity of the ivermectin plus the
      extracellular blockade of the receptor used by the virus will decrease the overall viremia
      and subsequently improve clinical outcomes.
