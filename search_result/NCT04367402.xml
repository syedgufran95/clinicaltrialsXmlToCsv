  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study is to define the genetic bases of COVID-19 related disease
      heterogeneity in frail population, to carry out a retrospective study on individuals w/wo
      symptoms to verify the reliability of a prognostic/diagnostic test based on IgM/IgG analysis
      and on the presence of genetic profiling and to explore the therapeutic potential of the
      modulation of ACE2 expression.

    <description>BioMedomics Rapid IgM-IgG Combined Antibody Test for COVID-19 is immunochromatography based. The test card contains colloidal gold-labeled recombinant novel coronavirus antigen and quality control antibody colloidal gold marker, two detection lines (G and M lines) and one quality control line (C) fixed on a nitrocellulose membrane. When 10 microL of test sample is added to the sample well of the test cassette, the sample will move forward along the test card via capillary action. If the sample contains IgM antibody, the antibody will bind to the colloidal gold-labeled novel coronavirus antigen. The antibody/antigen complex will be captured by the anti-human IgM antibody immobilized on the membrane, forming a red M line and indicating a positive result for the IgM antibody. If the sample contains IgG antibodies, the same thing happens, forming a red G line and indicating a positive result for the IgG antibody. If neither antibody is present, a negative result is displayed.</description>

    <description>By an in silico analysis, we found 2 missense variants in ACE2 gene annotated at residues 82 (rs766996587) and 355 (rs961360700) involved in PPIs with MAF&lt;0.01. Variants in other residues of the ACE2 may affect protein structure and/or activity/localization, influence the binding of the spike protein and thus the virus ability to enter the respiratory tract.In light of its relevance in cell entry, pharmacological approaches aimed at modulating ACE2 expression, through the modulation of SIRT1 activity in the lung or by selective oligo antisense treatment, should help in counteracting COVID-19 infection. Annotated SNPs evaluation of the TMPRSS2 gene showed 4 exonic common polymorphisms (MAF&gt;1%); of these, rs12329760 is a missense variant in the SRCR domain mediating PPI and ligand binding. Common SNPs are at the 3'UTR, possibly involved in regulating mRNA stability and several rare variants mapped in exons encoding the peptidase domain, potentially affecting protein activity.</description>
