      To evaluate the role of N terminal pro B type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP), D-Dimer, and
      Troponin - I as risk factors in COVID-19 patients and to correlate these markers with
      in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19

      Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), a contagious novel coronavirus now called severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; formerly called 2019-nCoV).

      Cardiac injury is a common condition among the hospitalized patients with COVID-19. It t was
      recently reported that 19.7% patients with COVID-19 had cardiac injury with more adverse
      clinical outcomes compared to those without cardiac injury (Shi S, et al, 2020) Fulminant
      myocarditis due to direct viral infection can certainly occur, but in patients with increased
      oxygen demands due to tachycardia and fever and reduced oxygen delivery due to hypotension
      and hypoxemia, COVID 19 disease can cause myocardial injury indirectly. Cytokines released
      during the acute infection can elicit activation of cells within pre-existing atherosclerotic
      lesions, augmenting thrombotic risk and risk of ischemic syndromes. Moreover, microvascular
      activation by cytokines can cause not only myocardial injury but can also harm other organ
      systems commonly involved in COVID-19 infections including the kidneys.(Peter,2020) Treatment
      in intensive care units (ICU) has become a major challenge; therefore, early recognition of
      severe forms is absolutely essential for timely triaging of patients. Several laboratory
      parameters may facilitate the assessment of disease severity. The recognized risk factors
      such as old age and underlying comorbidities-particularly cardiovascular diseases, diabetes,
      respiratory diseases, and other conditions (Zhou et al,2020) Several markers have been
      identified that modulate the course of COVID-19. The heart failure marker, N terminal pro B
      type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), increased significantly during the course of
      hospitalization (Guo T, et al ,2020) The sensitivity of cardiac troponin testing that ensures
      it is one of the earliest and most precise indicators of end organ dysfunction. Cardiac
      troponin testing could prompt early initiation of measures to improve tissue oxygenation and
      perfusion.

      COVID-19 infection is associated with intra-alveolar fibrin deposition, leading to lethal
      respiratory failure; reports suggesting that anticoagulation or fibrinolytic therapy can
      improve clinical outcomes (Wang J, et Al , 2020) ; case series implying that large
      percentages of severely affected COVID-19 patients suffer clinically significant thrombosis
      (Porfidia A , et al ,2020)
