    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if prophylaxis with RTB101 decreases the severity
      of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 among adults ≥ 65 years who reside in a nursing homes in
      which one or more residents or staff have laboratory-confirmed COVID-19

      RTB101-210 is Placebo-Controlled Study to Determine if Prophylaxis with RTB101 as Compared to
      Placebo Reduces the Severity of Laboratory-Confirmed COVID-19 in Adults Age ≥65 Years who
      Reside in a Nursing Home in which One or More Residents or Staff have Laboratory-Confirmed
      COVID-19. This trial is being conducted in follow up to a Phase 3 trial, in which trends
      toward a reduction in the severity of laboratory-confirmed RTIs including coronavirus RTIs
      were again seen. Therefore, RTB101 is a potential pan antiviral immunotherapy that may
      prevent or ameliorate viral RTIs, including COVID-19, in older adults.
