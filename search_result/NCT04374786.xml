  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the COVID-19 global health pandemic, many people are likely experiencing increased
      stress. The well-being of physicians in training may be significantly impacted by this
      pandemic. Meditation is a self-management strategy that can be utilized by anyone to assist
      with the management of stress. Meditation mobile applications, such as the &quot;Calm&quot; app, can be
      used to help manage stress, especially during this uncertain time. The investigators propose
      a prospective evaluation of perceived stress, anxiety, burnout and sleep disturbance in the
      house staff at Banner University Medical Center Phoenix, with the use of the mobile
      meditation app, &quot;Calm.&quot; The investigatros additionally want to evaluate the feasibility of
      using the mobile app, including looking at adherence to use of the app and physician
      satisfaction with use of the app.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 global pandemic is significantly impacting healthcare providers and presumably
      affecting their stress level as they deal with this time of uncertainty. The COVID-19 public
      health crisis requires the full resources and attention of healthcare systems. This has led
      to several healthcare changes that affect physicians in training, including changes to
      rotations and schedules, risks of infection exposure to themselves or their families, and the
      unknown impacts this may have on their residency and fellowship experiences.

      These changes are likely impacting their stress, health, and well-being. Physician burnout is
      major concern for the medical community and likely to be further impacted by the current
      pandemic. Evidence-based interventions for stress include cognitive behavior therapy,
      although this can be time consuming, requires the need for specialized providers, and is not
      feasible for everyone during this COVID-19 pandemic. Pharmacotherapy can be used, including
      antidepressants and anxiolytics, however they have inherent limitations such as side effects,
      tolerance, and interactions that limit their use. Consumer based mobile applications (apps)
      may help individuals with self-management strategies for stress. Mindfulness meditation is
      one type of self-management strategy and is the practice of moment-to-moment awareness in
      which the person purposefully focuses on the present without judgement.

      &quot;Calm&quot; is a mobile app that offers a range of meditation lessons, sleep stories (bed-time
      stories for grown-ups), sleep music, and nature sounds with modules that vary in length,
      instruction, and content. Few studies on the use of &quot;Calm&quot; exist and include a randomized
      controlled trial evaluating its affect to decrease stress among college students and a
      descriptive study evaluating cancer patient's perceptions of the app. There is evidence to
      support the use of similar apps in resident physicians. A pilot study assessing the effects
      of a meditation app on resident wellness suggested both the feasibility and efficacy of such
      an intervention. During these unprecedented times of the COVID-19 pandemic, mobile apps such
      as Calm may be potentially beneficial to help with stress in house staff physicians, although
      this requires further investigation.

    <time_frame>Completed study Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>Validated perceived stress scale survey, 10 questions in length rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (very often). Scores are obtained by reversing responses (e.g., 0 = 4, 1 = 3, 2 = 2, 3 = 1 &amp; 4 = 0) to the four positively stated items (items 4, 5, 7, &amp; 8) and then summing across all scale items. Individual scores can range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress.</description>
