  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The registry of COVID-19 patients was designed to collect epidemiolgical, demographic,
      clinical, anamnestic and outcome information together with serological and microbiological
      samples from COVID-19 patients admitted at the University Hospital of Verona (Azienda
      Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata, AOUI Verona). All SARS-CoV 2 positive patients admitted
      and able to give an informed consent are included, irrespectively of age and gender.

    <textblock>
      Anamnestic data are collected at the enrollment, while all the other clinical and
      epidemiological information are retrieved retrospectively from patients' medical records and
      electronic health records.

      Serological and microbiological samples (blood samples, fecal samples and nasal/rectal swabs)
      are collected within 48 hours after admission and during the hospital stay, according with
      routine internal procedures.The biological samples are stored at the University Laboratory
      for Medical Research (Laboratorio Universitario di Ricerca Medica, LURM).

      A dedicated database has been created and implemented to collect all the above mentioned
      information.
