  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At least 1 in 6 COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital to receive extra oxygen will die of
      complications. In patients with COVID-19, invasive treatment such as mechanical ventilation
      (e.g. breathing with a machine) is associated with a 50% increased risk of death. Invasive
      treatments use a lot of healthcare resources in intensive care units and may lead to further
      deaths if patients do not have access to care.

      The investigators aim to improve outcomes for COVID-19 patients by implementing hyperbaric
      oxygen therapy (HBOT). HBOT allows patients to breathe 100% oxygen in a special chamber at a
      pressure higher than sea level. It is approved by Health Canada for 14 conditions. HBOT is
      safe when administered by experienced teams.

      There are two main causes of death in severe COVID-19 respiratory infections: (i) a decreased
      diffusion of oxygen from the lungs to the blood and (ii) an increased inflammatory response
      (also called a &quot;cytokine storm&quot;). HBOT leads to increased oxygen level in blood, has strong
      anti-inflammatory effects, and may destroy the virus responsible for COVID-19 disease. The
      initial experience with HBOT and COVID-19 from China, France and the United States is
      promising in that it prevents further worsening of the condition and need for intensive care.

      The investigators propose to test the effectiveness of HBOT for COVID-19 patients who are
      admitted to hospital to receive extra oxygen. Using the most rigorous and innovative research
      methods, this Canadian-led international study will operate at 5 centers across 3 countries
      (Canada: Ottawa, Toronto, Edmonton; Switzerland: Geneva; UK: Rugby/London). The investigators
      anticipate that when treated by HBOT, COVID-19 patients needing extra oxygen to breathe will
      see significant health improvements as well as a decrease in complications, inflammation in
      the blood, need for invasive care, death, and cost of care.
