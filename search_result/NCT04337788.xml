  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the last 3 months the world copes with the novel coronavirus disease : Covid-19 emerged
      in China in the end of 2019. WHO declared the pandemic situation as a Public Health Emergency
      around the world on January 2020.

      Firsts studies emphasized on higher risk to older adults to experience serious health
      consequences : hospitalizations and mortality, due to multimorbidity and multimedication.
      Nursing home resident are particulary frailer and vulnerable.

    <description>Nurses answer a daily resident-reported questionnaire (e.g. temperature, dyspnea, pain), edited by French health authorities. From D0 to D20, data are transmitted to the NHSP. Warning algorithms specially developed for older persons identify signs that are monitored by the NHSP geriatrician coordinator. A feedback is provided to the general physician for specific actions required and appropriate support.
A last questionnaire is completed at D30 by the nurse in order to stop monitoring and know event occurred between D20 to D30.</description>
