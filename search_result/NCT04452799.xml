      SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 is representing the major global burden that implicated more than 10
      million infected cases and 500 thousand deaths worldwide. The prevalence of this pandemic
      disease is expected to rise every day. The challenge is to control its rapid spread meanwhile
      looking for a specific treatment to improve patient outcomes. Hesperidin is a classical
      herbal medicine used worldwide for a long time with an excellent safety profile. Hesperidin
      is a well-known herbal medication used as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent.
      Available shreds of evidence support the promising use of hesperidin in prophylaxis and
      treatment of COVID 19. Herein, we discuss the possible prophylactic and treatment mechanisms
      of hesperidin based on previous and recent findings. Hesperidin can block coronavirus from
      entering host cells through ACE2 receptors which can prevent the infection. Anti-viral
      activity of hesperidin might constitute a treatment option for COVID-19 through improving
      host cellular immunity against infection and its good anti-inflammatory activity may help in
      controlling cytokine storm. Hesperidin mixture with diosmin co-administrated with heparin
      protect against venous thromboembolism which may prevent disease progression. Based on that,
      hesperidin might be used as a meaningful prophylactic agent and a promising adjuvant
      treatment option against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      Research Background and Rationale At the end of December 2019, pneumonia of unknown origin
      was detected in the hospitals of Wuhan city, China, and reported to the WHO country office
      for the first time [1-3]. After a few days, the Chinese government has confirmed the
      human-to-human transmission of the new infectious respiratory disease [4]. At the end of
      January 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),
      caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), as an international public health emergency. The
      disease termed coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) rapidly transmitted from China to all over the world
      and subsequently the WHO declared it a global pandemic disease. The virulent virus structure
      is closely related to (SARS-CoV) strain with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA
      composition[5].

      This pandemic disease is particularly of major importance to the whole world and especially
      to countries with a heavy population like Egypt. There is a critical need for emergent,
      continuous, and cost-effective health care delivery to infected people. Early detection and
      strategies for prevention of progression of COVID-19 would make a major difference for
      infected patients and would also be economically beneficial for a resource-constrained
      country.

      People infected with COVID-19 may have no symptoms but still, act as a source of infection to
      other surrounding persons. The most common clinical manifestations following infection range
      from mild symptoms of (generalized fatigue, dry cough, low-grade fever, and sore throat) to
      severe symptoms of (typical severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and
      pneumonia)[6]. Although the tremendous scientific research effort is focusing mainly on the
      use of antiviral drugs, certain drug repurposing, and vaccine production for the treatment of
      COVID-19 patients, there is no specific cure or vaccine for treatment up till now. New drug
      development is a time-consuming process so that drug repositioning may be the optimum
      solution to control this pandemic infection.

      Selected Drugs Hesperidin is a common flavone glycoside found in citrus fruit such as lemons
      and sweet oranges[7, 8]. Hesperidin has several pharmacological activities such as
      anti-atherogenic, antihyperlipidemic, antidiabetic, venotonic, cardioprotective,
      anti-inflammatory, and antihypertensive actions. The anti-inflammatory activity of hesperidin
      was mainly attributed to its antioxidant defense mechanism and suppression of
      pro-inflammatory cytokine production[7]. Hesperidin exhibited anti-viral activity against the
      influenza virus through a significant reduction of virus replication. Treatment of infected
      cells with hesperidin enhanced cell-autonomous immunity via activation and upregulation of
      p38 and JNK expression which is essential for cell defense mechanisms against influenza
      virus[9].

      Hesperidin has been used as an herbal medicine for a long time. The safety of hesperidin was
      confirmed by FASEB (Federation of American Societies of Experimental Biology) upon request of
      the FDA. Toxicity studies have confirmed the high safety profile of hesperidin after oral
      intake. Results from oral toxicity studies showed the absence of adverse side effects after
      oral hesperidin ingestion of more than 2g /kg [10].

      Daflon 500 mg is a marketed tablet dosage form containing a micronized flavonoid mixture of
      50 mg of hesperidin and 450 mg of diosmin which used as vasoprotective venotonic agent[10].
      This hesperidin mixture is characterized by its high safety profile. Continues oral
      administration for hesperidin mixture to rats for 13 and 26 weeks, using a very high dose of
      35-fold of the daily dosage showed no toxicity with a high LD50 value of more than 3 g/kg
      body weight. Clinical trials used more than 2850 patients treated with the hesperidin mixture
      for a period of 6 weeks to 1 year showed normal hematological parameters, hepatic and renal
      functions with no signs of toxicity[11].

      Hesperidin role in prevention and treatment of COVID 19 was recently published by our
      research team in Medical Hypotheses journal [12].

      Unraveling host cellular receptors used for cellular entry of COVID-19 will provide possible
      lines for attack. Cell entry of COVID-19 depends on two consecutive steps, firstly binding of
      the viral spike (S-protein) to host cellular receptors followed by priming of S-protein by
      cell proteases. Recently, researchers showed that COVID-19 uses the ACE-2 receptor for entry
      [13] and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for priming of S-protein. Camostat mesylate, a serine
      protease inhibitor drug blocked virus entry and was used as a COVID-19 treatment in
      Japan[14].

      COVID-19 binds to the ACE-2 receptor through its specific Spike-receptor binding domain (RBD)
      sequence to form the SARS-CoV-2-RBD-ACE-2 complex. The proposed computational activity of 78
      anti-viral drugs against the human ACE2 receptor was screened using homology modeling. This
      study showed that hesperidin is the only compound that could target the binding interface
      between SARS-CoV-2 Spike and ACE2 human receptors. based on virtual screening, hesperidin may
      disrupt the interaction of ACE2 with RBD of SARS-CoV-2 thus block its entry into the lung
      cells [15]. Therefore, hesperidin can be used as a promising prophylactic agent against
      COVID-19 infection.

      Host antiviral responses against COVID-19 infection depend on the activation of both the
      immune systems and cellular self-defense mechanisms. Immunity plays a major role in the
      protection of the host against viral infection. The occurrence of immune over-response or
      immune deficiency is responsible for the condition of infected patients becoming critical or
      severe[16]. The anti-viral activity of hesperidin against the influenza virus involves its
      role in the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The MAPK host
      defense cascade contributes to efficiently restraining viral replication, spread, and
      minimizing tissue damage[9]. A recent study showed that the interferon-MAPK pathway played an
      important role in the COVID-19 immune response[16]. Therefore, hesperidin by its activation
      to host immunity my help against COVID-19 viral replication and hence its progression which
      will improve the patient outcome.

      Patients infected with COVID-19 exhibited what is called &quot;cytokine storm&quot; which initiated
      primarily as an inflammatory response and resulted in uncontrolled over-production of soluble
      markers of inflammation. Available evidence showing that cytokine storm, is a major cause for
      the development of ARDS. Cytokine storm involves the release of various immune-active
      molecules such as Interferons (e.g. IFNγ), interleukins (e.g. IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6), chemokines,
      and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α ) [17].

      Hesperidin with its high anti-inflammatory activity inhibited the secretion of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ and IL-2[18]. Besides, hesperidin inhibited IL 1β
      stimulated inflammatory responses by inhibiting the activation of the NF κB signaling
      cascade[19]. It also played a major rule in suppressing the release of inflammatory markers
      such as (TNFα and IL-6) in type 2 diabetic patients[20]. Therefore, it can be used as
      adjuvant therapy to control the severe inflammatory reaction against COVID-19.

      Activation of coagulation pathways following the immune response to COVID-19 infection
      promotes clot formation. The proposed mechanism of formation of micro thrombosis involves the
      occurrence of procoagulant-anticoagulant imbalance, platelet activation, and converting
      fibrinogen to fibrin. Disseminated intravascular coagulation predisposes to the development
      of multiorgan failure especially in severe infected cases[21].

      A prophylactic dose of heparin (with low molecular weight, LMWH) is recommended for
      protection against venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 hospitalized patients[21]. In this
      context, it is essential to highlight the role of concomitant administration of hesperidin
      and diosmin mixture with heparin for protection against thromboembolism. Results from
      previous clinical trials that used Daflon 500 mg with LMWH confirmed the significant effect
      of this combination compared to LMWH alone in preventing the incidence of pulmonary embolism
      and deep vein thrombosis. Therefore, co-administration of LMWH and Daflon 500 mg can
      significantly inhibit clot formation and prevent disease progression [22].

      Diagnostic criteria The viral research institution in China has conducted preliminary
      identification of the SARS-CoV-2 through the classical Koch's postulates and observing its
      morphology through electron microscopy[1]. So far, the golden clinical diagnosis method of
      COVID-19 is nucleic acid detection in the nasal and throat swab sampling or other respiratory
      tract samplings by real-time PCR and further confirmed by next-generation sequencing Clinical
      classification of patients Patients can be grouped into three categories: asymptomatic, upper
      respiratory tract infection (URTI) when presenting with rhinitis, pharyngitis, or isolated
      low-grade fever and myalgia, and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) when presenting
      with symptoms of pneumonia or bronchitis[3].

      Side effects of (Hesperidin and Diosmin mixture, Daflon®) Like all medicines, Daflon 500 mg
      can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Some cases of commonplace
      gastrointestinal disorders and neurovegetative disorders (feeling of discomfort) have been
      described, which do not require stopping the treatment.

      Safety concerns of (Hesperidin and Diosmin mixture, Daflon®) Daflon 500 mg tablets is
      POSSIBLY SAFE for most people when taken by mouth for up to 6 months. The safety of using it
      for a longer period of time is unknown. Side effects include stomach pain and upset,
      diarrhea, and headache.

      Contraindications of (Hesperidin and Diosmin mixture, Daflon®) No reported contraindications.

      Interactions of (Hesperidin and Diosmin mixture, Daflon®) No sever drug-drug interactions,
      only moderate and minor interactions

        -  Celiprolol: (Moderate drug-drug interaction) Hesperidin may reduce the absorption of
           celiprolol.

        -  Diltiazem: (Moderate drug-drug interaction) Hesperidin may reduce the absorption of
           diltiazem.

        -  Verapamil: (Moderate drug-drug interaction) Hesperidin may increase the absorption of
           verapamil.

        -  Antihypertensive drugs: (Moderate drug-drug interaction) Hesperidin may lower high blood
           pressure might cause your blood pressure to go too low.

        -  Anticoagulant / Antiplatelet drugs: (Moderate drug-drug interaction) Hesperidin may slow
           blood clotting which might increase the chances of bruising and bleeding.

        -  Sedative medications (Benzodiazepines) (Moderate drug-drug interaction) Hesperidin may
           cause too much sleepiness.

      Special Precautions &amp; Warnings:

        -  Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Hesperidin is POSSIBLY SAFE for pregnant or breast-feeding
           women when taken by mouth with diosmin.

        -  Bleeding disorder: Hesperidin might slow blood clotting and increase the risk of
           bleeding. In theory, hesperidin might make bleeding disorders worse.

        -  Low blood pressure: Hesperidin might lower blood pressure. In theory, taking hesperidin
           might make blood pressure become too low in people who already have low blood pressure.

        -  Surgery: Hesperidin might prolong bleeding. There is concern that hesperidin might
           increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgical procedures. Stop taking
           hesperidin at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.

      Research Objectives

      This research proposal was employed as a practical strategy for providing a suitable drug or
      drug combination for possible treatment of COVID-19 infected patients. This drug may help to
      prevent the progression of respiratory complications. This can be achieved through different
      goals as following:

        1. Screening of different drugs related to different pharmacological classes depending on
           its possible activity against COVID-19 virus.

        2. Providing cost-effective and easy-to-implement treatment strategy for infected patients
           and/or patients with high risk of developing respiratory failure.

        3. Finally, this clinical strategy remains an important goal in improving Egyptian health
           state which can save their life meanwhile save a lot of money.
