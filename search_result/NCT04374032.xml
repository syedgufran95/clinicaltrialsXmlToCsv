  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The justification for the use of immunomodulatory therapy is based on the evidence that drugs
      that are inhibitors of interleukin IL6 may prevent the more severe lung tissue damage caused
      by cytokine release in patients with more severe COVID19. Several studies have suggested a
      &quot;cytokine storm&quot; caused by the release of IL-6, IL-1, IL-12 and IL-18 with tumor necrosis
      factor TNF alpha and other inflammatory mediators. Increased inflammatory response of lung
      tissue may result in increased gas exchange at the alveolar-capillary level making
      oxygenation difficult in patients with more severe forms of the disease and the need for
      mechanical ventilation. In this regard, it is hypothesized that the use of immunomodulatory
      therapy should have an effect in reducing the lethal outcome, the need for oxygen therapy,
      and mechanical ventilation.
