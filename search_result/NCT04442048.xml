  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if immunization with IMM-101 will reduce the
      incidence of severe respiratory and COVID-19 infections in cancer patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no vaccination available for COVID-19. However, there are vaccinations for
      the seasonal flu and pneumonia.

      IMM-101 is a new type of immune stimulating therapy being developed for the treatment of
      cancer that may also help in preventing severe respiratory and COVID-19 infections.
      Laboratory tests show that IMM-101 works by activating parts of the immune system that are
      also involved with protecting against viral and bacterial infections, so that if you are
      exposed to these types of infections your body may be able fight off the infection better.
      That could help prevent severe symptoms from respiratory and COVID-19 related infections. It
      has been studied in over 300 cancer patients who have also been receiving other cancer
      treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation, and seems promising, but it is not clear if
      it can offer better results than not having the immunization at all.

             equivalent, or depot corticosteroids in the 6 weeks before enrollment) or
             immunosuppressant drugs (such as azathioprine, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, etc.) within
             the 14 days prior to enrollment. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement
             steroid doses ≤ 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of
             active autoimmune disease. Steroids used for premedication prior to chemotherapy or as
