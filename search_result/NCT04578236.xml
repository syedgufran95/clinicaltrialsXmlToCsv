      Efficacy of Aerosol Combination Therapy of 13 Cis Retinoic Acid and Captopril for Treating
      Covid-19 Patients Via Indirect Inhibition of Transmembrane Protease, Serine 2 (TMPRSS2)

      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) has infected over 20,000,000
      people causing over 700,000 deaths. It has no currently approved treatments.Airborne
      SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans initiate from the virus entering nasal and airway epithelial
      cells through binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Transmembrane protease,
      serine 2 (TMPRSS2), a cellular protease that activates the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,
      colocalizes with ACE2 and can prime SARS-CoV-2 fusion directly at the plasma membrane.
      Transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is an androgen receptor signaling target gene and
      an androgen-regulated cell-surface serine protease expressed predominantly in prostate and
      lung epithelial cell. TMPRSS2 is normally expressed several folds higher in the prostate
      relative to any other human tissue, though the normal physiological function(s) remains
      unknown. A study found that dihydrotestosterone (DHT) s a potent activator of TMPRSS2.On the
      other hand, Feily et al noted that low-dose isotretinoin (0.5 mg/kg/day for 15-20 weeks) in
      PCO patients with moderate to severe nodulocystic acne resulted in significant decreases in
      levels of serum total testosterone, prolactin, and dihydrotestosterone A study demonstrated
      that 13- cis -Retinoic acid competitively and reversibly inhibits dihydrotestosterone.
      Therefore, we suggest that 13- cis -Retinoic acid will downregulate TMPRSS2 expression
      thorough temporary preventing the effect of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on the activation of
      TMPRSS2 gene expression. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are commonly taken by heart patients to
      reduce blood pressure and to treat heart failure.Earlier studies had cautioned that this
      class of drugs could possibly increase the risk for the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2,
      infection and elevate COVID-19 severity. There is conflicting observational evidence about
      the potential clinical impact of ACE inhibitors and ARBs on patients with COVID-19. Select
      preclinical investigations have raised concerns about their safety in patients with COVID-19.
      On the other hand, Preliminary data hypothesise that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
      inhibitors and renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors could benefit patients
      with COVID-19 by decreasing acute lung damage and preventing angiotensin-II-mediated
      pulmonary inflammation. Here in our review, we use established and emerging evidence based on
      the findings of previous studies and researches to propose that ACE inhibitors may benefit
      patients with COVID-19 via attenuating and abolishing the effect of androgenic hormones on
      inducing the expression of Transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), even though, at the
      same time, ACE inhibitors cause an increase in the human cell surface receptor protein ACE2
      which the novel coronavirus uses to enter and infect cells. A study on hypertensive rats
      demonstrated that using ACE inhibitors(captopril) abolished and attenuated the effect of
      dihydrotestosterone (DHT). In this study RAS inhibition exhibited beneficial effects on
      androgen-induced obesity and abolished the androgen-mediated increase in blood pressure (BP)
      observed in this model of PCOS. (83 ± 1 vs 115 ± 3 mmHg, p&lt;0.0001). A another study found
      that the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril abolished testosterone effect and
      attenuates testosterone-induced benign prostatic hyperplasia in rats; a mechanistic approach.
      Captopril is a potent inhibitor of the angiotensin converting enzyme. These effects of
      testosterone were almost prevented by captopril (100 mg/kg). In conclusion, generally
      treatment with ACE inhibitors is associated with reduced androgen levels. Therefore,we think
      that Transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is an indirect target of ACE inhibitors and
      13 cis retinoic acid As aresult, we hypothesize that any drug which downregulates TMPRSS2
      expression through targeting AR, AR co-regulatory factors, or AR downstream transcription
      factors might be potentially effective against COVID-19 and is worth investigating under a
      clinical trial..
