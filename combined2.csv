Blood samples are collected before the baseline injection (day zero), 1 day after the second injection (61 days post) and 1 month following the second injection (90 days). Weekly symptom checks and monthly antibody testing around day 180- will identify residents with COVID-19 and the severity of COVID-19 symptoms.,Basic Science,Triple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator),Blinding is done to ensure staff and residents do not modify reports or reporting of COVID symptoms and to minimize other behaviors (such as sleeping, eating habits, physical activity) that may affect their innate immune system. It will also serve to minimize any bias in the processing/analysis of samples and the interpretation of the study results.
During the conduct of the study, only three people (the statistician and 2 research nurses who will reconstitute, draw up, and administer the injections) will have knowledge of the group assignments.
